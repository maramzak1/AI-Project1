🔹 1. Breed Classification from Scratch
A deep learning model, built entirely from scratch, accurately identifies dog and cat breeds based on user-provided images, ensuring high precision across diverse animal appearances.

🔹 2. General Recommendation System (RAG-based)
Utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with FAISS, LangChain, BGE-small-v1.5, and Gemma 3, the app provides daily care recommendations, including diet plans, exercise routines, and grooming tips tailored to each breed.

🔹 3. Anomaly Detection in Animal Health
An AI-driven module monitors animal behavior and physical indicators to detect anomalies, helping users identify potential health issues early.

🔹 4. Natural Remedies Recommendation System (RAG-based)
Upon detecting an anomaly, a second RAG system suggests natural remedies and treatments, personalized based on the breed and the specific health condition.

🔹 5. X-ray Image Analysis
Advanced AI models are integrated to analyze X-ray images, offering support to veterinarians and pet owners in diagnosing internal health concerns.

Milo Vet Care combines the power of AI and compassion to provide proactive, accessible, and intelligent care for every pet.
