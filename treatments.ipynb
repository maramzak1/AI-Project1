This one began like most others—first as a compilation of research, expressed knowledge, and the inspiration and ideas of an author or two. But now after many years have passed and many thousands of peo- ple have read, shared, used, and reflected on the content from its pages, this book has grown into something much more—something far greater than anything I ever expected. For many, Herbs for Pets has become a gold standard—the definitive guide to herbs for pets. But it is not the authors, nor even the information contained in its pages, that stand at the forefront of this book’s resounding success. It’s the growing audiences of pet loving people who are realizing that the biggest rewards of animal companionship can come only after we learn to accept and respect the true nature of our animals. Without people like you, this latest edition would not exist. Thank you. And once again—thank you to my now ex-wife and forever friend, Mary, who remains one of my foremost herbalist teachers. Thanks also go to Nancy Kerns, editor of Whole Dog Journal magazine, who throughout the years has been keeping the “holistic word” alive and visible to so many like-hearted animal lovers. And thanks to my dear friend Ikuko Kanada, who not only translated this tome into Japanese but also has been at the forefront of a new natural pet care revolution in Japan; your work brings renewed hope and inspiration to all who truly care about animal wellness. Thank you to Gail Pope and all of the incredible people at Brighthaven Sanctuary—a place where, because of you, miracles really do happen. A special thanks to all of you who came to our rescue when my home burned in the Montana fires of 2000. There is absolutely nothing to describe the feelings of love coming from so many people. And of course, thank you to all of the wonderful holistic veterinarians and natural pet-care providers who work on the front lines to bring the gifts of human intellect, love, and compassion to the true innocents of the world: the animals. —Greg L. Tilford Acknowledgments I would like to thank and acknowledge my parents, George and Dixie Wulff for allow- ing me to be who I am and for letting Uncle Eldon give me my first puppy; Cindy Nicholls, a dear friend; Jan Newman, my cousin and friend: Jeanie Notti-Fullerton, a dear friend who shares a deep love and devotion for all creatures; to all of my animals past and present, for sharing their love and lives with me: Mister, Max, Mollie, Cedar, Willow, Stephanie, all gone but in my heart forever; Sage, the new Heeler in my life; Lili, the new cat in my life; and to Frog (the Doberman) and Kyra, the Shepherd; to my ex-husband, Greg, who made this book and many things possible, thank you for being a good friend. —Mary L. Wulff Herbs and animals have lived together for a long, long time. Millions of years before the first human walked the earth, creatures large and small were using plants as their primary source of healing. In fact, much of our modern medicine originates from what early humans learned through observation of wild ani- mals and their instinctive uses of plants. For instance, we know that Indian tribes of the western United States learned of the powerful antimicrobial properties of Ligusticum porteri by observing bears ingest and roll in the plants to heal themselves. Even today, the plant is still known by many as “bear medicine.” In the face of diseases such as AIDS and cancer, modern-day pharmaceutical researchers continue to scour the remaining wilds of our planet in search of cures, and once again we are turning to the animals for answers. Zoopharmacognosy, a new dis- cipline of science that investigates how animals use plants to heal themselves, is attracting attention at leading research universities throughout the world. At the fore- front of the zoopharmacognosy effort are Dr. Eloy Rodriguez, a biochemist specializ- ing in natural products and synthetic chemistry, and Harvard primatologist Richard Wrangham, who has been studying chimpanzees and gorillas in their native African habitats. Rodriguez and Wrangham have discovered that the apes have an innate abil- ity to select specific plant species for use against internal parasites. In fact, not only can the animals select plants that possess specific medicinal compounds that are effec- tive at expelling their parasites but somehow they know exactly how much plant material is needed to initiate a cure without causing toxic side effects. As zoopharmacognosy recaptures our attention and as our respect toward the healing wisdom of animals grows, our quest for herbal curative answers is becoming more urgent. But we’re faced with a problem. Strains of bacteria once thought to be conquered are reemerging despite our antibiotics, and healing resources are disap- pearing faster than we can discover them. Tens of thousands of acres of wild lands are lost each day to the effects of a growing human population and the relentless demands we place upon the planet. The Smithsonian Institution and fifteen other research organizations recently completed a twenty-year study that concluded that at Introduction least one in every eight plant species worldwide are currently at risk of becoming extinct. In North America alone, it is estimat- ed that 29 percent of sixteen thousand plant species are on the verge of disap- pearing forever—and with each loss, a vital connecting link between earth and all the creatures who walk her ground is being broken forever. As scientists struggle to find cures before plants are eliminated from the face of the planet, a tremendous “green revolution” is under way. A growing number of people are coming to realize that much of the healing wisdom we seek rests not in science and technology but within the ancient healing traditions of nature itself. To access this awareness, we find ourselves turning to the aborig- inal peoples (who adopted healing ways from observing animals) to relearn ways of healing that have been passed down through hundreds of generations from humankind’s oldest teachers—the animals. Ancient cultures knew that healthful living, healing, and good medicine are not gauged by how effectively people can exploit the medicinal properties of natural resources. Instead, shamans and medicine women of the past saw human health as an integral part of the living celestial body we have since grown to know as Earth. They knew that our gravest ills emanate not from what nature bestows upon us but from what we bestow upon nature. This message is being repeated to us everywhere in the form of ancient bacteria, once thought to be conquered, that are mutating into stronger, more resistant, more aggressive strains of infectious disease. Vaccines that we once viewed as miracle medicines are now thought to debilitate the immune sys- tem they were designed to support and protect. Heart disease, cancer, arthritis, osteo- porosis, and even psychosis-driven murder are being linked to the stresses of modern society and the nutrition-depleted foods we eat. Violent rainstorms of unprecedented ferocity wreak havoc as a by-product of air pollution and the effects of global warm- ing. You may ask, how is all of this relevant to a book about herbal animal care? The answer: in the most fundamental ways imaginable. This book introduces you to hundreds of plant medicines that can be used in the daily care of animals. In the first chapters, you learn the importance of feeding your companion a natural whole-foods diet. Then step by step you are guided into new levels of self-reliance as you learn to select, prepare, and apply natural remedies, many of which may be as accessible as your own backyard, on behalf of your Herbs for Pets 10 companion animal. To help overcome possible skepticism, we have provided references to hundreds of cutting-edge scientific studies that support the effec- tiveness of herbs in animals. But even more significant to the purposes of this book, we share what herbalists and animals have learned in the absence of science (without the cruel inhumanities of animal testing) from thousands of years of continuously safe and effective herb use. However, all of this represents the lesser side of what this book has to offer. Our deepest wish is to pass on the sense of interconnectedness that grows within the heart of the healer, as he or she learns and accepts ancient ways of heal- ing that have been utilized by all life- forms on earth. This is not just a book about finding alternatives to conven- tional drugs; it is one about honoring and supporting a system of health care and healing that far exceeds the effectiveness of any medicine devised by humans—a sys- tem contained in and shared among the bodies of animals, plants, and Mother Earth herself. In nature, plants represent much more than containers of active chemical con- stituents that have been identified and validated by the halls of human science. They are healing delegates of nature’s design, here to serve the needs of all creatures who benefit from the nectar of their flowers, the shelter of their leaves, and the healing powers they hold. They are the critical link between what is alive and what is not, pro- viding us and other organisms with the oxygen that is necessary for life and the base elements of the food chain—from macrobiotic soil nutrients to the vegetables on our dinner plates. Yet most people see plants as humanity’s gift: insignificant by virtue of their silence but powerful and valuable when their secrets are revealed by science. Likewise, most of humanity still sees animals as expendable, lower forms of life that exist without intelligent consciousness or emotional pain and that offer no resistance when exploited. In the minds of millions of people, plants and animals are here for the sole purpose of serving us, as fruits and beasts of burden without equal rights, in the pursuit of health and happiness. Whether it be a feedlot steer or a companion German shepherd dog, the needs of most animals become secondary concerns when we are buying pet food at the grocery store or when a chronic immune system disorder erupts into a house- hold flea infestation. Instead of addressing their pet’s real needs, many pet owners are Introduction 11 predisposed to remain focused on themselves—the grocery bill dictates the quality of nutrition their animals receive, and fleas are approached as something that invades our homes, rather than as a symptom of a weakened animal host. With Herbs for Pets, we hope to precipitate a change in this paradigm. The fact that you are reading this book implies that you are not like most people—in fact, you are part of a growing community of special human beings who are on a healing path that leads to something much more significant than the simple joy derived from opening up a can of cat food for the cat or giving the family dog rawhides to keep him busy. Like us, the authors of this book, you have probably discovered that caring for an ani- mal brings about a very special and powerful type of healing. When we provide our companion animals with considerations of health and heal- ing that meet their needs and not just our own, we are in effect healing ourselves as well. In fact, we are healing one of the primary causes of earth’s greatest ills: human- ity’s disconnection from nature. Somewhere in the history of our species we have chosen a relationship of con- sumption and control rather than of coexistence with our planet, and it seems that our goal has been to defeat or defy nature at all costs. We defy nature’s mechanisms of resisting disease by suppressing or bypassing the immune system with corticos- teroid drugs, antibiotics, and vaccines. We ignore the natural requirements of good nutrition by supplementing an unhealthy diet with vitamin tablets. We dam rivers and drain swamps; we even try to change the duration of daylight by resetting the clocks for “daylight saving time.” To compound all of this heady nonsense, we have placed our own self-imposed needs far above those of our earthly neighbors, and as a result the entire planet is suffering. For much too long, the human condition has prohibit- ed us from living in harmony with the natural world that surrounds us. The key to changing this trend rests not in the halls of science but in our willing- ness to see nature as nature is. Instead of studying the nature of plants from a mind- set that insists on picking their chemistries apart in an arrogant attempt to find singu- lar compounds that may be exploited as drugs, we must learn to examine plants as they exist in nature, to discover and explore the intermingled relationships they share with the physical and nonphysical needs of all living things on earth. Likewise, instead of subjecting our animals, our most ancient teachers, to unthinkable pain and torture in a quest for rational answers to satisfy our scientific needs, we must learn to accept nature’s medicines simply as nature presents them. The reality is that the need for sci- entific validation is shared only among humans—no other life-form on earth insists on analyzing and rationalizing nature’s design, especially at the cold-hearted expense of animal suffering. In essence, science is merely striving to rationalize what has been known throughout the natural realm for eons. This is a book about a level of healing that reaches far beyond that which can be provided by science. It is about holistic healing in its truest sense—a process that does not begin or end with the administration of a medicine but with our connection to nature. Holistic healing is not something that is given or received between caregiver and patient—it is part of a continuous circle that is shared among all entities involved Herbs for Pets 12 in the maintenance of health. Our planet provides the elements from which plants are born and must reproduce. The animals and insects serve as stewards for the plants and in turn pass their intuitive wisdom to us. However, to access this wisdom, we must rethink our ways—we must relearn how to give for all that we receive from nature, and we must pay attention to the quiet lessons that surround us in the circle of life. As someone who cares for a companion animal, you have taken a fundamental step back toward the circle of life by accepting a part of nature into your home. Now, as you investigate the healing power of nature’s oldest medicines, and as you learn how to honor your companion’s innate system of health maintenance, you will find yourself stepping into the circle. Here you will find that animals are not human property but are among our most valued teachers and healers. You will see that from the moment a puppy, a kitten, a baby bird, or another companion animal enters a human life, a special bond with nature begins. From this bond we can learn innocence, compassion, respect, unconditional love, and the tragedy of time wast- ed. And most important of all, we can finally realize that despite centuries of our abuses, animals and plants remain quietly waiting to reconnect humankind with the ways of nature. In return for these offerings, and to assure that the circle remains unbroken by our presence, we must give something equally precious back to our beloved companions and teachers: we must listen to them and help serve their needs by providing the nat- ural foods and medicines that have sustained their kind for millions of years. Introduction 13 The holistic herbalist looks beyond the symptoms of disease to identify and correct their underlying causes. Using Herbs Naturally Old ways die hard—especially when we have been raised with them. In our soci- ety, mainstream approaches to health maintenance focus on symptomatic inter- vention. Typically, when a person or animal gets sick, the conventional practi- tioner works to identify and suppress uncomfortable or unsightly symptoms in order to achieve immediate relief. As children, most of us are taught time and again to confront fever with pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen; dandruff with shampoos; and constipation with laxatives. But what about the causes of these discomforts? Are we really taking a cura- tive approach toward a fever if we don’t recognize its origin and its purpose? Why do we have dandruff anyway? Why are our animals suffering with chronic constipation? These are questions that are addressed by the holistic herbalist— one who looks at the body as an entire, intricately balanced biocommunity of countless organs, chemicals, microorganisms, and life energies. From a holistic perspective, the herbalist realizes that all body functions are interdependent and that physical or emotional discomforts do not represent the totality of a health crisis but only the body’s conveyance of an underlying imbalance or crisis—a state of “dis-ease.” Unlike conventional Western medicine, the focus of holistic healing is not to kill or cut out disease as it occurs, but to reestablish and maintain holistic home- ostasis, the state of harmonious balance and rhythm among mind, body, spirit, and environment. For most of us, this involves putting some old predispositions aside, revving up the imagination, and engaging in some open-minded obser- vation. We don’t need bioscience degrees to embrace the principles of effective herbalism, but we are required to view health and healing from a much deeper perspective—one that takes into account not only the discomforts of disease but Principles and Practices of Herbalism Principles & Practices Chapter 1 Herbs for Pets 16 AAFCO: Association of American Feed Control Officials ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone AIDS: acquired immune deficiency syndrome ASPCA: American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals AVMA: American Veterinary Medical Association BHA: butylated hydroxyanisole BHT: butylated hydroxytoluene CHV: canine herpes virus CoQ10: coenzyme Q10 CPR: cardiopulmonary resuscitation DLE: discoid lupus erythematosus EFA: essential fatty acid FDA: Food and Drug Administration FeLV: feline leukemia virus FIP: feline infectious peritonitis FIV: feline immunodeficiency virus (also known as feline AIDS) FUS: feline urinary syndrome FVR: feline viral rhinotracheitis F: Fahrenheit FLUTD: feline lower urinary tract disease GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid GBE: ginkgo biloba extract GI: gastrointestinal GLA: gamma-linolenic acid G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase GST: glutathione S-transferase HCl: hydrochloride HCM: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HSV: herpes simplex virus IU: international unit MAOI: monoamine oxidase inhibitor NDGA: nordihydroguaiaretic acid PABA: para-amino benzoic acid PAF: platelet aggregating factor PAs: pyrrolizidine alkaloids PDA: patent ductus arteriosus RDA: recommended daily allowance sp.: species (singular/not specified) spp.: species (plural) TCM: traditional Chinese medicine TSH: thyroid stimulating hormone TTouch: Tellington Touch LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS also the totality of wellness. From this perspective, for example, smoking is not a cause of lung cancer but a by-product of whatever prompts us to smoke in the first place. Cigarettes are only a mechanism of cellular destruction, and the tumors they feed are the end products of something insidious that lies within the psyche of the host. It is that “something” that allows us to abandon our well-being in favor of an addictive habit we all know is bad for us, and it is from this level that the heal- ing process must begin. Although this bit of holistic philoso- phy may sound simple, it is fundamen- tally broader than Western orthodox medicine, which centers on intervention and subsequent suppression of disease symptoms. Western society is spoiled by the concept of making problems go away quickly so we can get on with life. Rather than taking the longer route toward finding a true cure, the conven- tional goal is to find a quick-fix solution to the inconveniences of a crisis. Herbs are often employed in much the same capacity. The greatest healing potential of herbs, however, emanates not from their uses as natural drug alternatives but from the holistic principles and philoso- phies that enable us to use them in sup- port of the natural healing mechanisms of the body. The holistic herbalist looks beyond the symptoms of disease to identify and correct their underlying causes. An herbalist strives to understand the har- monious checks and balances that are required among all physical and non- physical aspects of mind, body, spirit, and environment. At the core of this tightly orchestrated synergy, we find a continual need for complete nutrition because a body must have the fuel and tools it needs to build, maintain, and repair itself. In the absence of complete nutrition, necessary tools and building blocks are missing, and the body lacks the resources to make repairs and correct imbalances. In addition to complete nutrition, a body sometimes requires a specialized source of stimula- tion or systemic support in order to maintain a state of health and well- being. This is where herbs come in. The holistic herbalist employs the chemical and energetic properties of plants to help bridge the gaps between what a body receives from complete nutrition and what it requires from time to time in terms of supplemental sup- port. In this holistic context, herbs are used to stimulate, regulate, or adjust natural body functions back into healthy harmony with the rest of the body. The therapeutic effort is directed not at treating disease but at support- ing the body in its efforts to correct the problem itself. In other words, herbs are used to assist the body naturally at what it is designed to do: stay healthy. For many people, allowing the body to cor- rect itself may not be easy because this requires trust in something that still baf- fles our greatest scientists: the body’s remarkable, almost miraculous, ability to take care of itself. A liv- ing body, be it animal or human, represents a sys- tem of healing and health maintenance more effi- cient than anything devised by human intel- lect. To allow herbs to work at their optimum potential, the herb user must respect and honor the healing powers with which we were all born. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 17 Herbs for Pets 18 The Many Faces of Herbal Medicine Many of the plants we use in Western herbalism are identical to those used in other modalities of herbal medicine. But the philosophies of how an herb inter- acts with the mind, body, or spirit tend to vary greatly from culture to culture. Here are some brief descriptions of three of the most popular forms of holistic medicine in which herbs are commonly employed. • Ayurvedic Medicine In India and adjacent areas of the Middle East, ayurveda has prevailed as the primary modality of healing for thousands of years. Ayurvedic medicine focuses on recognizing the doshas, the metabolic body type of an individual. The first step in ayurvedic healing is to identify the specific strengths, suscepti- bilities, and tendencies of the patient from a broad perspective and to take into account the entire constitution of the individual. Once these are identi- fied, herbs, diet, meditation, or other mechanisms are used to bring the constitution of the individual back into harmonious balance with all ele- ments of the mind, body, spirit, and environment. • Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbs have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for at least seven thousand years. Many principles of TCM are similar to those of ayurvedic medicine. The primary dif- ference is in how the body is viewed in terms of channels, rivers, winds, and energetic flows in TCM. In other Traditional herbal cabinet at a Chinese pharmacy words, the body is seen as a reflection of nature, and practitioners look for energetic blockages or disruptions— dampness, dryness, hot or cold winds, or bank breaches in the flow of qi (pro- nounced “chee”), the life force. The physical body is also viewed as a set of balanced polarities: yin, which gener- ally refers to the tissues of the body organs, and yang, the activity of the organs. Yin and yang are opposites that cannot work independently of one another. If a yin deficiency occurs, it is because the body does not have proper nutrients or adequate physical structure to perform its functions. If a yang deficiency occurs, the body can- not react to metabolic stimuli. In TCM, herbs are used to assist and maintain proper energetic flows and polarities in the body. • Western Herbalism In contrast, Western herbalism seems almost superficial in nature. Western herbalism originates from ancient uses of medicinal plants in Europe. Many of the principles, philosophies, and cer- tainly our validations of how herbs are used to effect healing are constantly evolving in this form of herbalism. For instance, the spirituality of the healer, the patient, and even the herb itself was once the primary focus of herbal medicine in ancient Europe. But today, Western herbalists incorporate many philosophies, including scientific vali- dation of photochemical compounds, plant energetics, folkloric accounts and belief systems, and several other points of opinion. As Western herbalists, we base our use of herbs on a balance of all philosophies. We respect and admire recent scientific validations of medici- nal plant chemistries, but we also strongly believe that plants contain synergistic balances of chemical, ener- getic, and perhaps spiritual elements that make them unique and unex- plainable. We see a great deal of value in much of the anecdotal evidence that has been handed down regarding the traditional uses of herbs over the past few millennia. Although scientific studies have failed to validate many of the claims that have been passed down through the ages, the fact that many of these customs have worked safely and effectively for thousands of people throughout several centuries is certainly convincing to us. But despite differences in opinion, most Western herbalists share a similar, holistic per- spective when it comes to doing the actual work of healing. The body is viewed from a bio- logical perspective but with a focus that takes into account the totality of the individual. While mainstream modalities of Western medicine focus primarily on the treatment of disease and suppression of symptoms with little regard to cause, the herbalist works from the opposite direction. While working to promote health by addressing the underlying causes and providing aid to the body’s efforts, the Western herbalist views the body as a tightly knit biosystem of organs, cooperative cells, microbes, enzymes, nutrients, and synergistic energies that must be maintained in a state of cooperative balance. During a disease crisis, herbs are utilized to strengthen or stimulate the body’s natural func- tions at chemical and energetic levels so that a state of health can be reestablished quickly and efficiently. After the crisis is over, herbal tonics may then be used to strengthen body functions that are chronically deficient to avoid reoccurrence. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 19 Herbs for Pets 20 While the philosophies that lead people to the use of herbal medicines are variable worldwide, all modalities of herbal healing share two fundamental similarities. One is that the therapeutic focus is holistic, taking into account the totality of the individual instead of the symptoms of disease only. The other is that all good herbalists know that herbs work best in a proactive capacity when employed from a perspective that rec- ognizes health maintenance as the paramount cure for disease. HERBS AS ALTERNATIVES TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES Many of us are introduced to the realm of herbal medicine by using herbs as direct replacements for over-the-count- er or prescription drugs. Like drugs, herbs can be used to treat the symp- toms of disease effectively. Unlike many drugs, herbs are relatively safe and gen- tle medicines—they are very forgiving, offering a much greater margin of error and fewer adverse side effects. Most drugs are composed of specif- ic chemical compounds that have been isolated from their source and concen- trated to maximum potency. A medici- nal plant, however, consists of dozens, sometimes thousands, of interactive or inert chemical components. Many skeptics argue that herbal medicines are less effective and unsafe because the concentrations of active con- stituents are too low and are variable from plant to plant. To the herbalist, the presence of sci- entifically proven compounds is only Herb Substitute Uses HERBS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY USED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR CONVENTIONAL DRUGS Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) Used as an anti-inflammatory alternative to yucca root (Yucca schidigera), steroidal, and nonsteroidal drugs Black walnut (Juglans nigra) Used in place of conventional wormers Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) Saint-John’s-wort (Hypericum spp.) Used as a natural substitute for Prozac (fluoxetine HCl) Oregon grape (Mahonia spp.) Used as an antibiotic for eyes, ears, and mucous membranes Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) Skullcap (Scutellaria laterifolia) Used as alternatives to sedative drugs Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata) Hop (Humulus lupulus) Dandelion leaf (Taraxacum officinale) Used in place of furosemide (Lasix) Senna (Cassia angustifolia) Used as a natural laxative part of what makes a plant useful. Instead of focusing on isolated chemical components, the herbalist accepts the inexplicable synergy that exists among all components of a plant’s chemistry and all components of the physical and nonphysical recipient. In the mind of the herbalist, this is what makes herbal medicine safe, effective, and unique. The whole plant is always greater, and usual- ly safer, than the sum of its parts. For those who are trying to break away from conventional ways of think- ing, this concept of holistic synergy can be difficult to grasp. Having been raised and trained in a science-based culture, accepting something that cannot be fully rationalized can be difficult. But to put things into a scientific perspective, let’s look at thymol, the primary active constituent of thyme (Thymus spp.). Thymol is potentially toxic when iso- lated from the rest of the thyme plant. But when employed as part of the whole plant in a tincture or tea, thymol serves as an active part of a safe and effective antimicrobial, dewormer, and cough suppressant medicine. Anybody from any discipline of sci- ence can pick up a simple herbal remedy and use it for the purpose of treating ill- ness. It’s really very easy to substitute many of the favored conventional medi- cines with herbal remedies. But here are a few important things to remember. • Keep in mind that herbs are slower acting than most drugs. Expectation of rapid results is perhaps the greatest cause of frustration and failure among would-be herbalists. The dif- ference between a successful herbal therapy and resorting to a shot of, say, prednisolone often amounts to a day or two of patient waiting. • When using herbs as direct replace- ments for allopathic medicines, don’t expect results beyond those you would expect from the drugs you are replacing. The only difference in ther- apy when using herbs as drug substi- tutes is the medicinal device; the cur- ative depth of the therapy remains the same. • If you opt to use herbs symptomati- cally, it is important to remember that you will likely end up dis- couraged if you expect to find a cure. For example, when treating conjunc- tivitis that is second- ary to bacterial infec- tion, a combination eyewash of Oregon grape (Mahonia aqui- folium), raspberry leaf (Rubus idaeus), and ster- ile saline will effectively replace most conventional ophthalmic preparations— but just like a conventional preparation, the herbs won’t address the underlying causes of a chronic problem. HERB ACTIONS AND SPECIAL AFFINITIES It is unrealistic to think a full conveyance of effective herbal wisdom can be con- tained in this book, but a large measure of awareness can be perpetuated by embracing a basic understanding of how each of these plants works within the body. In Western herbalism, the effects that plant materials have in or on the body are called “medicinal actions” or “active properties.” By becoming famil- iar with the medicinal actions of the herbs to which you have access, you will have a good idea where to look for an appropriate course of therapy when a need for one arises. In addition to know- ing the manner by which herbs work in the body, it is also important to begin Principles and Practices of Herbalism 21 Herbs for Pets 22 A BASIC START-UP APOTHECARY FOR VETERINARY APPLICATIONS All of the herbs in this table are generally safe, well validated, and easy to use in a wide variety of veterinary applications.

For instance, we may know that slippery elm has a general astringent action (meaning that it shrinks tissues), but its effective usefulness can be really pronounced when we know that it has a special affin- ity to the digestive tract, where its astrin- gent actions are particularly well suited to shrinking the inner wall of the small intestine to relieve diarrhea and other discomforts. DOSAGE AND DURATION OF THERAPY The dosage suggestions provided in this book represent what we feel are safe and conservative starting points for use in most animals. The exact dosage and duration of an herb therapy that your companion may need depends on the animal’s specific needs, tolerances, and metabolism. In other words, the answers to how much and for how long may vary from animal to animal. Some animals respond favorably to very small doses— perhaps just a drop or two of tincture. Others require larger doses or may not respond to certain herbs at all (as you know, such is the case with drugs too). Therefore, a conservative starting point for administration of herb extracts, infusions, or dried herbs in dogs, cats, and herbivores is to use only one or two herbs at a time and to proportion the dosage based on the animal’s body weight compared to the recommended human dosage. For example, a 30-pound dog would receive one-fifth of that which is rec- ommended for a 150-pound human. Also to be considered is your veterinar- ian’s opinion, a reputable reference book, or the product manufacturer’s recommendations. Remember, this is just a starting point. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores have much faster metabolic rates than we do; therefore, initial dosages might have to be increased later to achieve the results you are looking for. The biggest mistake is to think of dosing in terms of absolutes. Instead, watch the animal you are treating; read up on the side effects, contraindications, and active nature of the herbs you are using; and don’t hesitate to change dosages. If you need to increase a dosage, do so in 10 percent increments to a maximum of 50 percent above the starting dose. In other words, if you have determined that the starting dose for “Max” is 20 drops of burdock, twice daily, then you can increase the dose 2 drops at a time until you reach 30 drops, if necessary. If a dosage needs to be decreased (if, for example, valerian causes acute vomiting in your cat), cut the dose in half. If you feel it’s neces- sary, stop the therapy altogether for a day or two, and let the animal’s body readjust before proceeding with the reduced dosage. Most animals require a dose two to three times daily. The duration of an herbal therapy also depends on the specific animal and varies according to the disease you are confronting. Generally, it is best to take at least a two-day break from herbal therapies each week (five days on, two days off). This allows you to monitor the animal’s responses to the herbs and to alleviate any tolerance or toxicity prob- lems she may otherwise develop as a result of long-term use. The duration required to see results varies greatly and is dependent on the nature of the herb, the animal, and the severity of the imbalance you are confronting. If results don’t begin to materialize after Herbs for Pets 26 you have maintained a maximum dosage schedule for more than seven days, it may be time to try another herb or to consult your holistic veterinarian. In any case, keep detailed records of your successes, failures, and observa- tions. Exactly how long to maintain an herbal therapy can be determined only through experience and familiarity with your animal, and good record keeping is instrumental to becoming an effective herbalist. A Few Words About Toxicity Serious adverse reactions are rare, but when used outside the parameters of common sense and moderation, any plant can be toxic. Toxicity is dose dependent, relative to the rate of absorption and the individ- ual’s ability to assimilate or eliminate an excess. If a body receives a substance in quantities or concentrations that cannot be effectively dealt with by its natural functions, the excess must be dealt with by emergency means. Vomiting, diar- rhea, and other purgative functions are then triggered to eliminate the invasive substance(s). If this fails, systemic shut- down or damage may occur. Most herbs that are commonly used in veterinary medicine are safe and for- giving—in most cases in which an ani- mal is hypersensitive to an herb or has received too much, she will vomit short- ly after administration. Other common indicators of toxicity include itching, photosensitivity, and diarrhea. The key word in the avoidance of toxic reactions is moderation. Although herbs are generally weaker and gentler medicines than most drugs, they still demand respect. “More” is not necessar- ily “better,” even in the employment of nutritive “food-medicine” herbs such as nettle (Urtica spp.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), or flaxseed (Linum spp.). All of these herbs may cause digestive upset and dermatological reactions if fed to the animal in large quantities. Aside from the issues of overdose and prolonged use, it is important to remember that some animals may have allergies to certain herbs; a few are especially sensitive to certain plant sub- stances; and some have preexisting con- ditions. Therefore, to be safe, it’s always a good idea to proceed with caution. Start with a small dose, and watch the animal for any signs of adverse reaction. When to Take Your Pet to the Vet This book is aimed at enabling you to be somewhat self-sufficient in ensuring the health and welfare of your com- panion animals. However, there are some problems that caregivers should not attempt to treat on their own at home. Some of these include life-threatening situa- tions such as poison- ings; major traumas such as those caused by being hit by a car; bleeding; broken bones; instances when the con- dition you’re treating at home doesn’t get better in a few days; and cases in which there are ques- tions or other avenues of treatment to be taken. Most of us believe that our animals must be seen by a vet in order to get treatment. In many cases this is true. But holistic vets can’t be found in all areas of the U.S., so it becomes nec- essary for some of us to Principles and Practices of Herbalism 27 Herbs for Pets 28 CAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS The following chart lists a few of the most common types of problematic plant compounds to be aware of in the natural care of animals. This list is intended for the purpose of cau- tious awareness. It is by no means complete, and the presence of one or more of these compounds in a specific herb does not necessarily exclude that herb from safe use. Anthraquinones Anthraquinones, including dianthrone glycosides, sennosides, aloe-emoden, chyso- phanol, among others, are the active laxative constituents that are present in aloe (cer- tain preparations), senna (Cassia senna), cascara sagrada, and turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Anthraquinones act as laxatives by stimulating intestinal peristalsis and may cause cramping and severe diarrhea if misused. These compounds are hard on the liver and kidneys, and extended use of anthraquinone-bearing herbs may lead to depend- ency. Coumarins Coumarins include coumarin, medicagol, furanocoumarins, among others. Most coumarin-bearing plants do not contain enough coumarins to represent a risk in nor- mal therapeutic doses. Large doses of coumarins, however, can cause photosensitivity. Coumarins are known to thin the blood and may potentiate the effects of anticoagu- lant drugs. Coumarin-rich herbs such as red clover (Trifolium pratense) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) should not be given to animals with clotting disorders. Oxalic Acid and Oxalates Oxalic acid and oxalates are present in many plants (a small amount is even present in fresh spinach), but can be found especially in members of the Polygonaceae and Cruciferae families. Oxalic acid is characterized by a tart, lemony flavor and is especial- ly evident in the leaves of sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and French sorrel (Rumex scu- tatus). Oxalic acid can cause urinary tract irritation, can deplete the body of vitamin B1, and is known to bind with calcium in the urine—thus potentially causing stones. Although the oxalic acid content of most herbs, such as yellow dock root (Rumex cris- pus), is generally small and usually will not cause a problem with moderately dosed, short-term use (up to fourteen days), it is best to avoid such herbs in cases of preexist- ing kidney or urinary disease. Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are present in many plants but most notably in comfrey (Symphytum officinale). Most PA-bearing plants have received an undeserved bad name; it takes doses that are dozens of times in excess of a therapeutic quantity to cause hepatotoxic effects—especially in a healthy liver. Nonetheless, there are docu- mented cases of liver damage (in both human and animal modalities) as a result of comfrey overuse. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 29 There are hundreds of different alkaloid compounds present in thousands of medicinal plant species—many are generally safe; some present a risk of toxicity. Many present themselves as the primary active constituent of a plant. Perhaps the most frequently employed alkaloid in Western herbal medicine is berberine, the bitter yellow substance that is found in Oregon grape (Mahonia spp.), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), and a few other plants. Berberine is generally safe, but overuse of berberine-rich plants may overstimulate bile production (especially in cats), resulting in vomiting. Berberine is contraindicated in pregnant or lactating animals. Salicylates Salicylates, including salicylaldehyde, salicin, methyl salicylate, salicylic acid, among others, are the precursors to acetylsalicylate (aspirin). This means that herbs such as willow bark (Salix spp.), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), poplar (Populus spp.), and others must be used with extreme caution in felines or other animals who are sensitive to aspirin. Saponins There are hundreds of different saponin (soaplike) constituents in various plants. Most notably, saponins are among the primary active constituents in valerian (Valeriana offic- inalis), licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.), sarsaparilla (Smilax spp.), and yucca root (Yucca spp.). Saponins are characterized by their foaming, soapy nature. Although they seldom pres- ent any problems, excessive or extended use of saponin-rich herbs can produce GI irri- tation and vomiting, and some may eventually interfere with the absorption of fat-sol- uble vitamins. Sterols Sterols include ß-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ampesterol, among others. Some plants, such as licorice, that contain large concentrations of phytosterols or steroidal saponins can cause problems, such as water retention and hypertension, similar to those presented by steroidal drugs but only if used excessively or over an extended period. The side effects of phytosterols are much harder to procure, and can be largely avoided by occa- sional breaks in the therapy (for example, five days on, two off) and with concurrent use of diuretic herbs such as dandelion leaf and alterative herbs such as dandelion root and burdock. Tannins Tannins such as corilagin pyranoside, ellagic acid, and gallic acid are found in the bark and leaves of many herbs and are the most frequently employed astringents of the plant world. Herbs that are especially tannin rich include uva ursi (Arctostaph los uva- ursi), any part of the juniper (Juniperis spp.) plant, black walnut hulls (Juglans nigra), and white oak bark (Quercus sp.). Tannins are typically used to reduce inflammations of mucous membranes in the digestive and urinary tracts, but if used excessively they can have a reverse effect, causing mucosal irritation. Herbs that contain tannins should not be used in animals with inflammatory kidney disease. Some tannins are labor inducing (oxytocic) and may cause abortion in pregnant animals. consult with a vet over the telephone. Some holistic veterinarians do provide telephone consultations, but many don’t. No matter, it’s wise to have a local vet to whom you can take your animals in case of a major trauma or if surgery is needed. Basics of Herbal Preparations The manner in which an herb is used is determined by a holistic assessment of the particular circumstances at hand and the overall nature of the ani- mal. Once you have investigated the origins of the symptoms that have caught your attention, you can select the medicinal actions you need to confront the problem. This leads you to one or more herbs that have a spe- cific affinity to the body systems that are involved. Choosing the correct herb to fit ther- apeutic circumstances is critical not only to the effective treatment of disease but also to the conservation of botanical resources. Many plant species are cur- rently at risk of extinction because they have been touted as “curative silver bul- lets.” But in reality, there are no cure-all herbs. In fact, no single herb serves as a definitive cure for anything. For an herb to be used effectively and responsibly, it should be used only within the true con- fines of its therapeutic capacity. It also must be used in a form or preparation that is complementary to its medicinal attributes and the task at hand. Each herb’s physical and chemical structures determine how the herb should be prepared and subsequently administered. For instance, many herbs are very water soluble, which means that if you pour hot water over them, Herbs for Pets 30 Volatile Oils Volatile oils include myristicin, apiole, terpineol, sesquiterpenes, menthone, pulegone, piperidinone, thujone, jugulone, 3-octanol, among others. There are hundreds of volatile oil compounds, many of which make up the aromatic principles of a plant, present in thousands of plant species. Menthol, for example, is a volatile oil found in members of the mint family. The medicinal activities and toxicology of volatile oils are widely variable, but most have an effect on the genitourinary and digestive tracts, caus- ing irritation to the kidneys and urinary passages when used in large quantities. Others, such as the pulegone found in pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) or the myristicin and api- ole found in parsley seed (Petroselinum crispum) and nutmeg seed (Myristica fragrans), are potentially hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic if used in overabundance. Volatile oils have been shown to cross the placenta barrier to adversely affect the fetus of pregnant animals. The s-methyl cysteine sulfoxide and n-propyl disuldhide contained in garlic has been shown to produce Heinz-body anemia, a serious blood disorder, if the cloves are consumed in excess of 0.5 percent of the subject animal’s body weight. This means that a healthy 60-pound dog would have to eat several cloves of garlic just to start the Heinz-body process. The problem is dose dependent, meaning that blood structure quickly normalizes when garlic use is reduced or discontinued. CAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS (CONTINUED) their medicinal constituents quickly and completely infuse into the water, making their desired chemical attrib- utes freely available for the body to absorb and use. Many other herbs, however, are poorly water soluble, which means that if you pour hot water over them to make an infusion, little or nothing of medicinal value is drawn from the plant’s tissues. Following is an introduction to the basic how-tos of making herbal prepa- rations. Those of you who collect books will find that compared to other books on herbal medicines, the guidelines we offer here are loose. We have done this for the sake of practicality and simplici- ty. While exact measurements and strict procedures are necessary meas- ures of quality control in the commer- cial production of herbal products, the self-reliant herbalist really doesn’t have to worry so much about precision. As long as there’s enough herb, a strong- enough solvent, and the correct type of preparation, you will be rewarded with a good, strong herbal medicine. DRIED BULK HERB MATERIAL Dried bulk herbs are handy to have around because they allow for a great deal of diversity in how they can be prepared and applied. In addition to being used in various herb prepara- tions, some dried herbs can be sprin- kled directly onto an animal’s food. As a general rule, roots keep two to three times longer than dried leaf material. But don’t stock up on more than you can use within one year, and be sure to store your herbs in airtight containers that are kept away from sunlight. Regardless of proper storage methods, dried herbs eventually oxidize and lose their potency. A few herbs lose much of their medicinal and nutritive value within days of drying. Buy herbs from an honest, knowledgeable herbalist who knows the origin of his or her mer- chandise, or grow your own herbs to assure optimum potency and shelf life. FRESH HERBS Fresh herbs, clipped, dug, or plucked directly from a garden, are rich in nutrients and medicinal constituents. Provided that their physical nature allows for the form of preparation you need, fresh herbs are without compare in terms of medicinal potency. While most herbs are strong when used fresh, others require at least par- tial drying before they impart their active compo- nents into a useful medium. Cascara sagrada (Rhamnus purshiana) bark is one exam- ple. This herbal laxative is far too strong if used fresh and should be dried for at least a full year to mellow it before use. It is also poorly water solu- ble when fresh, and until it dries it will not infuse adequately in water for a good tea. HERB CAPSULES Because dogs and cats have short diges- tive tracts, encapsulated herbs tend to pass right through them. Even if they don’t, you may find some difficulty in getting a large enough dose into your animal. In horses, sheep, llamas, goats, and other herbivores, capsules work fine—but plan on feeding the animals dozens of them. In these animals, you are often better off feeding the bulk herb or using an extract. ALCOHOL EXTRACTS, OR TINCTURES With few exceptions, an alcohol tincture is by far the most versatile, strongest, and most readily usable form of herb Principles and Practices of Herbalism 31 preparation. It can be administered oral- ly; used in topical applications; diluted with water; or used as part of an eye, hair, or skin rinse. A tincture is prepared by soaking a measured quantity of fresh or dried herb in a certain proportion of alcohol and water, using a specific formula for each herb. The alcohol serves as a solvent that breaks down the plant material and releases the active ingredients into a liq- uid base called a menstruum. After two days to two weeks (depending on the method used) the menstruum is then strained and pressed from the plant material (called the marc), to produce the finished liquid product. Alcohol tinc- tures offer the advantages of maximum potency and unlimited shelf life provided they are stored properly. The concentrated liquid nature of tincture preparations allows for their quick and complete absorption into the body, even in the short digestive tracts of dogs and cats. When kept in 1-ounce dropper bottles, they can be carried any- where and are easy to use. The biggest problem with alcohol tinctures is getting them into an animal. These preparations are typically 30–70 percent grain alco- hol, and while typical dosages do not present any alcohol-toxicity problems, animals truly hate the way they taste. There are two basic methods for making tinctures: one is a process called percolation, the other, simpler method, is called maceration. The per- colation method entails using a specially designed, cone-shaped glass vessel. Herb material is placed into the cone, then the menstruum is poured over it, left to stand for a short while, and eventually allowed to trickle (or percolate) through the plant material and out a tube at the bottom end of the vessel. Making herb tinctures by maceration takes more time, but it is much simpler and requires no specialized equipment. To make a macerated tincture, herb material is placed into a glass jar, plastic container, or other nonmetallic contain- er. The menstruum is poured over the herb and the entire mixture is covered with an airtight lid and allowed to soak for a period of two weeks. The menstru- um is then strained from the plant mate- rial (the marc), to produce the finished liquid product. The proportions of alcohol and water needed to make an herb tincture vary according to the solubility of the herb itself. Some herbs, such as milk thistle seed, require a high percentage of alco- hol to extract optimum quantities of active constituents from their cell struc- tures. Other herbs, such as raspberry leaf, require little or no alcohol to extract their useful compounds. Fortunately, knowing what percentage of alcohol you need is easy because these determina- tions have already been done for you. Most of the formulas used in contempo- rary herbal practice are from the U.S. Pharmacopoeia and other standard refer- ences that have been used in the phar- maceutical production of simple herb Herbs for Pets 32 To make an herb tincture from fresh herbs, add 1 part herb to 2 parts menstruum. extracts throughout most of the twenti- eth century. This information is still used by herbalists and laboratories through- out the world and can be found in sever- al books about herbs and herbalism. The amount of menstruum needed to extract the active constituents from a plant also varies. With most fresh (un- dried) herbs, you will need a 1:2 ratio of herbs to menstruum. Most dried herb materials require a 1:5 ratio. This means that to make a tincture from the fresh root of dandelion, you need one part of chopped herb material (by weight) to two parts of menstruum (by liquid vol- ume). For example, 16 ounces of fresh root must be covered with 32 fluid ounces of menstruum to make a tincture (and the menstruum must be at least 40 percent alcohol). If you are using dried root, 16 ounces of dried root material will require 80 fluid ounces of menstruum to make a tincture. Make sense? Don’t worry if it doesn’t; we’ll simplify in a moment. So how does one make a menstruum? The most accurate and inexpensive way to make a menstruum is to buy pure grain alcohol (brand named Everclear) at a liquor store. Everclear is 95 percent pure grain alcohol (190 proof). For sim- plicity, let’s just call it a pure, 100 percent alcohol. To make a 70 percent alcohol menstruum, we would add 30 percent water to its volume (i.e., add 3 parts water to 7 parts alcohol). If it’s a 50 per- cent menstruum we need, then all we have to do is add an equal (50/50) amount of water. It’s that simple. Unfortunately, Everclear isn’t available in some portions of the U.S., so a medicine maker may have to do some liquor shop- ping. For tinctures that require 70 per- cent alcohol, uncut 151 proof rum works fine (it’s 75 percent alcohol). For a 50 percent menstruum, you can use 100 proof vodka (it’s 50 percent alcohol), and so forth. Now here’s the simplified version of medicine making we promised. Get some fresh or dried herb, chop it up or grind it as fine as possible, put it in a con- tainer, then add enough menstruum (of the appropriate strength) to just barely cover the herb. Cover the container, then let it sit for two weeks, strain the mixture through a cloth, and store the liquid in an airtight glass jar. Amber glass is best because it blocks ultraviolet rays that may damage your tincture. You now have an herb tincture. The primary rule in this simplified method of making tincture is always to use the correct per- centage of alcohol in your menstruum. If you do, you will always end up with a nice tincture by covering a maximum amount of chopped or ground herb with a minimum amount of menstruum. GLYCERIN-BASED HERB EXTRACTS, OR GLYCERITES Glycerites are made essentially the same way as alcohol extracts, but a solution of 60 percent vegetable glycerin and 40 percent water is used in place of alcohol. The big advantage of glyc- erites in animal care is their palatabili- ty—glycerin tastes sweet, with a flavor and consistency similar to light corn syrup. While some glycerin-based extracts are not as potent as their alco- hol counterparts, they allow pet own- ers to get the herbs into their animals in the first place—hence, half the bat- tle is won. Potency can then be adjust- ed by increasing the dosage. Vegetable glycerin is refined from coconut oils, and despite its syrupy-sweet flavor, it is metabolized in a manner similar to that of triglycerides, not sugar. This means it can be used safely in animals with alcohol sensitivity or in those with diabetes. Glycerites do not keep indef- initely but remain viable for at least two years if refrigerated. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 33 The biggest disadvantages of glyc- erites are their limited shelf life (one to two years) and, in many cases, their strength. Glycerin is not as strong a sol- vent as alcohol, and many herbs are not taken up well into a glycerin menstru- um, especially if they are of a resinous nature. However, some herbs, especial- ly those that are highly water soluble, release their active ingredients into glycerin very well. To find out if a partic- ular herb that interests you is good for making glycerites, refer to one or more of the books we recommend at the end of this section. WATER INFUSIONS (HERB TEAS) Infusions are made by steeping a specif- ic quantity of plant material in hot water. The disadvantages of using teas internally for animals are twofold: many animals don’t like tea, and it can be dif- ficult to feed an animal enough tea to bring about therapeutic results. Unlike tinctures, which provide a plant’s active constituents in a highly concentrated, fully assimilable form, teas generally amount to a weaker medicine, and plant compounds that are not water soluble are not imparted to the animal. Infusions are especially useful for skin and coat rinses and as vitamin- and mineral-rich tonic food supplements. When mixed into an animal’s food, an herb tea provides most of what a dried or fresh herb offers in a form that is quickly and more easily absorbed into the body. Herb teas also offer the advantage of melding with the flavor of an animal’s diet without adding a new texture to the food—an important attribute for those who wish to feed nutritive herbs to a finicky feline. DECOCTIONS A decoction is an infusion that requires some gentle simmering to make a strong enough preparation for therapeutic use. Decoction is required of many roots when the plant material is too insoluble Herbs for Pets 34 Then cover the mixture and store for at least one month. Completely cover the herb with olive oil to make an oil infusion. in water to allow a strong enough infu- sion. Decoctions should be prepared using a minimum of heat. Simmer the herb for about fifteen minutes at a tem- perature that is only slightly above the boiling point. Too much heat destroys many of the plant constituents you wish to employ. Decoctions are used in the same manner as water infusions, but they tend to be strong in comparison. OIL INFUSIONS An oil infusion is produced by complete- ly covering an herb with olive oil and allowing it to steep in a covered non- metallic container in a warm location for at least one month. The oil is then pressed out and stored in the refrigerator for up to one year. Although several choices of oil can be used, olive oil pos- sesses its own preservative qualities, is relatively affordable, and is nourishing to the body, both internally and externally. Oil infusions are excellent for topical applications, acting to soothe and pro- tect the affected area while holding the herb constituents at the site where they are applied. Extra caution should be used when applying oil to burns or infected areas because it may seal in heat and bacteria. In these cases, make sure that the possibility of infection has been addressed with a good, clean antimicro- bial preparation and the burn has entirely cooled before anything is applied. POULTICES A poultice is made by mashing plant material (usually dried foliage) with enough water or vegetable oil to make a wet, pesto-like paste. Poultices are good in topical field applications when other preparations are impossible to make. A simple poultice can be applied directly to an animal’s skin, or it can be made into a compress that can be secured onto the animal. To make a compress, wrap the wet poultice in a piece of clean cloth, allowing the liquid to freely soak through the cloth. Wrap the compress onto the affected body part and secure with knots. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 35 Then you can apply the poultice directly to your animal’s skin or fur. To make a poultice, mash the herb with water or vegetable oil until it forms a paste. SALVES AND OINTMENTS Salves and ointments are simply thick- ened oil infusions. In making salves, beeswax is frequently used as the thick- ening agent. The thinner ointment preparations typically employ coconut butter, particularly if the ointments are to be used in suppository applications. The oil infusion is gently heated, and the beeswax or coconut butter is melt- ed into the liquid until the cooled product yields the consistency that is desired. For salves, use a ratio of 1 ounce of beeswax or cocoa butter to 8 ounces of oil. If the salve or ointment turns out to be too thick or thin when it has cooled, gently reheat it and adjust the proportion of beeswax or cocoa butter. Suppository molds and salve tins are available through herb catalogs and at some drugstores. Herbs for Pets 36 To make a fomentation, secure a cloth over the affected area of skin and pour the infusion over it until the cloth is soaked. As with oil infusions, extra caution should be used when applying salves or ointments to areas of the body that are burned or infected. In these cases, make sure that a good, clean antimi- crobial preparation is used and that the burn has cooled completely before applying any kind of topical treatment to the area. FOMENTATIONS A fomentation is used for topical appli- cations where a water or oil infusion must remain on a particular body site for a specific period. Gauze or another cloth material is placed over the area, and the infusion is poured onto the dressing until it is soaked. Mustard packs, castor oil packs, and other tradi- tional remedies employ this method. This is a good approach for horses with fungal infections of the skin or other animals who don’t mind “wearing” an herbal ornament for a while. STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS A standardized extract is more of a plant drug than an herbal medicine. These preparations are made by scientif- ically increasing the content of certain active ingredients in order to bring about specific therapeutic effects. This is done by removing a desired active ingredient from the chemistry of a par- ticular plant species, then adding it back to the extract at much higher con- centration. For example, in nature, milk thistle seeds contain anywhere from 2 percent to 6 percent silymarin, the most medicinally active component of the plant. In cases of severe liver damage or toxicity, a much higher percentage of silymarin may be needed to quickly bring about a therapeutic effect. A milk thistle extract that has been “standard- ized” to as much as 80 percent sily- marin can be used in such cases. On the surface, standardized extracts may seem like a superior form of herbal medicine. In the aforementioned exam- ple in which milk thistle is indicated, this is absolutely true. However, it’s impor- tant to remember that when we stan- dardize an herb we alter its physical and energetic nature. Our manipulation of its nature is based on our scientific understanding of only one or a few of its chemical components. In its natural form, each herb is composed of hun- dreds of chemical components that are arranged in a unique, synergistic man- ner that cannot be replicated by sci- ence. It is this synergy that makes herbs a mysteriously effective form of medicine. Every time that we alter the chemistry of an herb, we change everything that the herb represents in terms of a natural and holistic medi- cine. To the holistic herbalist, the ques- tion is not so much what can be gained by standardizing an herb but rather how much is lost in the process. The bottom line is that standardized extracts are best reserved only for spe- cific indications—they do not represent a complete form of herbal medicine. The Connection between Herbs and Diet To use herbs to the best of their poten- tial, we must take on a holistic per- spective of health and healing that views all components of mind, body, spirit, and environment as equal parts of an individual’s well-being. At the core of this “whole body” perspective is a good diet. Without balanced nutri- tion, the use of herbal medicines in the holistic care of your animal is a waste of time, money, and plants. The food that your animal eats should provide all of the nutritional components that are necessary for all organs and systems of a healthy body Principles and Practices of Herbalism 37 to perform in harmonious unison. A properly functioning body does an amazing job of preventing disease and healing itself, and to do this it requires the energies and nutrients of a well- balanced diet. However, sometimes the body needs special measures of outside support to optimize its healing efforts to assist the body at working harder, faster, longer, or more efficiently toward reestablishing a balanced state of holistic health. Enter herbs. In the holistic context in which they are used most effectively, herbs serve as functional adjuncts to good nutri- tion by helping the body to use its innate and acquired resources more effectively. For example, echinacea does not act as a substitute for the body’s immune system but serves to stimulate the body’s natural defenses into working harder, thus boosting the body’s abilities to resist infection. Likewise, herbs such as dandelion root, Oregon grape, and burdock assist in the elimination of waste from the body by stimulating the liver and gallbladder into working more efficiently. These supportive functions are diet depend- ent: in order for an herb to call upon the body to do something extraordi- nary, there must be an adequate store of energy and building materials with which the body can work. Herbs for Pets 38 A GENERAL HERBAL DIETARY ADJUNCT Combine equal parts of the following: spirulina nettle dandelion leaf alfalfa powdered flaxseed This formula can be fed at a rate of 1 teaspoon per pound of food fed daily ( 1⁄2 teaspoon daily for cats) as an adjunct to a natural diet. While it may not fill all of an animal’s sup- plemental nutrition needs, it will complement his diet with foodlike concentrations of fully assimilable protein, vitamin C, B complex (including B12), vitamin A (beta- carotene), vitamin E, vitamin K, iron, potassium, calcium, phospho- rus, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Nettle is a good source of potassium. Dandelion flowers are rich in lecithin. Many people use herbs only for treating the symptoms of a disease in the absence of adequate nutrition and without considering the whole being. For instance, if we use an herbal ear oil externally to treat a chronic ear infec- tion without addressing why the body is unable to fight the infection by itself, we are not using a holistic approach toward healing. Instead, we are treat- ing only the symptoms of a disorder that emanates from the body’s inabili- ty to defend itself. While the ear oil may inhibit the external microbial cause of the infection, it is really doing nothing more than serving as a natural alternative to any number of pharma- ceutical preparations that may be able to alleviate symptoms more quickly. However, if our goals are to reach beyond the symptoms to affect the underlying causes of disease, the heal- ing effort must begin by ensuring that the body is afforded everything it needs to heal itself. In other words, we must provide the body with the foundation of holistic health—com- plete nutrition—before our healing efforts with herbal medicines can begin to approach curative results. Using Nutritive Herbs as Dietary Supplements Many herbs are foods, and some pro- vide nutritional qualities in such abun- dance that they can be used as nutri- tional medicines or dietary supplements. Herbs provide minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, and other nutritional components in a form that a body can fully utilize without becoming burdened with excess. Dandelion leaves, for instance, contain impressive amounts of potassi- um and iron but not so much as to pres- ent a risk of toxicity. With nutritive herbs, the body is given the chance to take the nutrients it needs and easily eliminate what it does not, unlike many highly concentrated vitamin supple- ments that force the liver, kidneys, and digestive tract to work overtime at their jobs of eliminating the excess. On the other hand, the nutritional content of herbs may vary considerably from plant to plant, and in therapeutic or dietary situations where high concentrations of specific vitamins or minerals must be guaranteed, herbs usually prove to be inadequate. Many herbs can be used as nutri- tional adjuncts to a good diet. Finding which nutritive herbs are best for the needs of an individual animal comes from the one-on-one experience of the caregiver with his or her animal, but a simple dried herb formula that can be used for most dogs, cats, horses, fer- rets, and other animals can be found in the box on page 38. The Ethical Use of Herbs We are living in a time when millions of people are turning away from any- thing they perceive as artificial, unhealthy, or forced upon them. A huge natural health care industry has arisen, fueled by people who are eager to embrace products, healing meth- ods, and lifestyles that offer a healing step back toward nature. On the sur- face of this “green revolution,” more people are becoming aware of the cur- ative possibilities that exist beneath the trees, and a renewed sense of hope for a healthy environment has been born. But in many ways, this scenario also brings about a whole new level of environmental crisis. While a great deal of promise may exist in our grow- ing awareness of earth’s natural treas- ures, our journey toward “getting back to basics” is consuming resources faster than we can learn to replace Principles and Practices of Herbalism 39 Herbs for Pets 40 BASIC ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE HARVESTING OF WILD PLANTS Follow these ethical guidelines if you wish to have the least impact on our earth while harvesting medicinal plants from wild areas. • Never gather endangered or environmentally sensitive species. Many plants are abundant in certain areas but relatively rare in others. Learn to recognize and use plant species in your home bioregion that are abundant and resilient to human impact, while taking into account that the ecological niche you see is a small, unique part of a much larger environmental picture. Get to know the general sta- tus of the plants you are interested in from a global perspective. You may find that as an “ecoherbalist,” your role among certain plants around your home is strictly that of guardian. • Be absolutely certain of plant identification before you harvest. Gathering the wrong plants not only may be harmful to you and your pets but may be wasteful and potentially damaging to the ecosystem as well. • Collect a small amount of plant material from several different stands to minimize your impact. Never gather so much from a stand of plants that you can see a dif- ference after your harvest. Remember, mathematical solutions to the number of plants that can be ethically harvested do not apply in the natural realm. The only way to determine how much is ethically acceptable is to begin learning about the ecology of your bioregion before you harvest. Observe your impact over a long period of time, and always gather conservatively. • Never gather from a group of plants until you have thoroughly investigated the health, welfare, sustainability, and interdependent elements of the entire area. Is there a healthier stand nearby? Is the stand large enough to sustain your impact? Do you know the ecosystem well enough to harvest plants in a manner that is conducive to its health? What may seem to be a lush, healthy stand of plants may in fact be a biocommunity in trouble. Walk, look, listen, feel, and, most important, learn as much as you can about the ways of the land before you begin your harvest. • Never gather more than you can conservatively use, bearing in mind that many herbs lose their potency quickly after harvest. Unless you plan to make alcohol tinctures, expect no more than six months to a year of shelf life for properly dried and stored herbs. • Always ask permission before entering private lands, even if you are doing the landowner a favor by pulling a few weeds. Check with your local land manage- ment agencies for permit requirements before you begin gathering herbs from public lands. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 41 • Keep a journal of your observations during each visit to a harvest site and learn to work within nature’s capacity. Remember, you will always be a student in nature, and there are no absolutes in how an ecosystem operates. Maintain a set of wildcrafting site records, and keep a detailed log for each wildcrafting ven- ture. From these records, you can monitor your long-term impacts while enrich- ing your awareness of nature. • Gather only from areas that are endemic to the plants you are looking for. Learn the typical elevation, habitat, soil composition, exposure, and climatic require- ments of each plant you wish to harvest, then harvest from areas that match these criteria. Small, isolated stands of plants that have adapted to an unusual set of environmental circumstances are particularly vulnerable to human impact and should be used for learning, not for medicine making. • Learn the environmental issues of your area, and familiarize yourself with other people who have an interest in the wild lands you will be working within, includ- ing other herbalists, the logging and mining communities, developers, environ- mentalist groups, and government agencies. Learn about their plans for the land, and adjust your activities. Plan ahead for the possibility of future impact. • Find opportunities to salvage or transplant useful plants from areas that are sched- uled to be heavily impacted by human activities such as areas where trail or road construction is planned. Many areas have ongoing native plant restoration projects under way. In these instances, you might be able to assist with the survival of native species by “weeding out” the invasive, nonnative species. • Find ideal stands that are representative of how a plant community should look, then don’t harvest from them. Instead, preserve them for use as models from which to base your observations and stewardship efforts at the sites from which you will be harvesting. • Always use the correct tools and wear the right clothing to get your job done. Digging long taproots from a steep, rocky hillside with a soupspoon while wear- ing penny loafers will result not only in physical trauma to the herbalist but will tear apart the hillside as well. Be considerate of the environment by acknowledg- ing that the human body is poorly adapted to many of the tasks we perform there. • Never gather from stands that are wilted or otherwise unhealthy. Not only may sick plants have altered chemistries but they may be covered with poison as well. Contact your county, state, or federal weed abatement officials and learn about weed control programs in your area before you harvest anything. Check your local noxious weed list, and see if there is an opportunity to reduce the distribution of toxic herbicides by offering to hand-pull the plants for healing purposes. Many homeowners and farmers will welcome you onto their land to gather plants such as dandelion, Saint- John’s-wort, mullein, burdock, or countless others. By focusing your wildcrafting efforts toward plants that people generally hate, you will be giving a precious gift of healing back to the environment by reducing the use of toxic herbicides. Herbs for Pets 42 • Be as quiet as possible and plan every step when you enter a wild area. Stop fre- quently to look, listen, and feel the earth; and don’t forget to look behind you to monitor the impact you may be causing while en route to that special patch. • When gathering from a stand of plants, work at a deliberate pace that allows you to remain conscious of your surroundings and of the task at hand. Harvest carefully and thoughtfully. Don’t attack the plants; work as the loving caretaker you are. • Always be careful to use the proper processing and storage methods for the herbs you gather. Spoilage equates to waste—one of the worst types of vicarious human impact. Good wildcrafting ethics are not exclusive to your time in the field—take care of the plants all the way from earth to medicine. • Stay obscure during your harvest and field studies. If you attract uninvited attention to a stand of plants, the result might be added impact from curious onlookers. A good rule is to always focus your efforts in areas where you will remain out of the view of other people. • Be critical of your human shortcomings. We are foreigners in wild areas. Strive to deepen your awareness to understand that even the simplest organisms of nature serve complex roles in the environment, and that we are all just beginning to learn the ways of the wild. Nothing is insignificant, and virtually every organism in an ecosystem is interdependent with the plants we harvest. • Never reseed a stand of plants to an extent that exceeds the natural density that existed prior to your harvest. A human-engineered overpopulation of plants can be as devastating to an ecosystem as careless overharvesting. Watch the bioregion from which you are harvesting over a period of several years, and take note of how each species reseeds itself. Then try to replicate what nature would do in your absence. Many plants compete with one another. Propagating an overabundance of a species may be satisfactory to our conscience but may also pass a death sentence to dozens of noncompeting plants and interdependent organisms. • Accept your personal weaknesses, identify your chronic mistakes, then add to this list your own personal set of wildcrafting guidelines. To learn more about the earth-conscious harvest, use, and preservation of wild medicinal plants, pick up a copy of From Earth to Herbalist by Gregory L. Tilford (Mountain Press Publishing, 1998). them. It seems that a great many of us have become so intoxicated by the freedom-based premise of using self- prescribed natural alternatives, we have forgotten where they come from. Many plant species are disappear- ing not so much because they are overharvested but because they are misrepresented in the marketplace. Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), for example, has been one of the most popular North American herbs of com- merce for centuries, but it is also one of the most misused. Like many other herbs, goldenseal continues to be her- alded as some sort of miracle medicine that is effective against virtually any microbe that terrifies us enough to try something “alternative.” Indeed, the popularity of this and many other herbs has arisen from therapeutic suc- cess stories and promising scientific studies, but most of their appeal is attributable to marketing savvy and no small measure of consumer hyste- ria. In truth, most plant medicines work within narrow parameters of therapeutic usefulness. Goldenseal is not a systemic antibiotic that courses through the body to fight infection like a shot of penicillin; instead, it works only to inhibit microbes it comes in direct contact with on the surface membranes of the digestive tract, eyes, and nasal passages. We must also take into account that many medicinal plants are at risk of disappearing because of factors totally unrelated to their uses as medicines. Pipsissewa (Chimaphila spp.), for instance, is used as a “secret ingredi- ent” in certain brands of soft drinks, and the habitat destruction associated with its harvest may be more devastat- ing than the loss of the plants them- selves. Another example is goldthread (Coptis spp.), which is an old-growth forest inhabitant that is quickly run- ning out of places to live in the Pacific Northwest. Goldthread is not a popu- lar plant of commerce in North America, but the old-growth firs and cedars it lives beneath are. And then there’s all the hype. Newsstands are packed with the latest word about scientific herbal break- throughs, even about the same medi- cines that just yesterday were consid- ered “snake oil” in the eyes of science. Some herbs are becoming as fashion- able as the fastest computer: if you haven’t tried the latest herbal craze, then your life is unnecessarily difficult. Don’t take Prozac—we’ve got Saint- John’s-wort, the herbal alternative for chronic depression. Too busy to slow down? Don’t worry. The latest double- blind studies say that we can boost the body’s immune system with echinacea, cat’s claw, astragalus, and ginseng. Herbs are touching the far reaches of our society at an unprece- dented rate. Much of what drives this green revolution is born from solid scientific discovery and consumers’ inde- pendent desire to take charge of their health and well-being. Certainly, these are good goals, but where do herbs come from? Is there something we should know about their natural environment? What do these plants contribute to their ecosystems? Do they really work the way that we are led to believe? What makes herbs different from Principles and Practices of Herbalism 43 conventional medicines? What effect is our consumption having upon plant populations and their environments? Our point is this: We have to be care- ful. If we wish to use and sustain our botanical resources into the future, we must step away from all the hoopla long enough to find healthful solutions for the plants themselves. The answers to all of the above questions rest within our will- ingness to look beyond the sensational advertising to see what herbs really are and what they represent in the larger global scheme of things. Until we do, our herbal heritage will continue to dis- appear under the pressures of ignorance, waste, and greed. Many North American medicinal plants of commerce are now being cul- tivated, but sadly, many of them contin- ue to disappear from the wild. While part of the problem stems from unethi- cal wildcrafting practices, the demise for plants such as goldenseal and American ginseng originates from a complexity of economic and environmental causes. As herbalists, we could easily point an accusatory finger at the herb industry, but this would not be fair. Many herbal- ists have chosen to exclude wild plants such as goldenseal, American ginseng, black cohosh, and osha from their per- sonal medicine cabinets as a gesture, if not a preventive measure against their demise. But in sad reality, such measures provide only a bandage treatment for a global problem. The painful truth is that too many people are impacting too much of the planet for too many rea- sons. Indeed, consumer demands are taking a serious toll on plants such as goldenseal and American ginseng, but these and thousands of other plant species are also disappearing under the combined pressures of logging, grazing, mining, weed abatement, urban devel- opment, farming, pollution, recreational impact, and several other human-cen- tered factors. So then, what can we do to save medicinal plants? On a community level, we can share what we learn from books such as this one by educating others on the curative possibilities that may exist beneath the trees around their homes. Show your neighbor a medicinal plant that grows on the roadside—such as mullein, dandelion, licorice, Saint-John’s- wort, or milkweed—and raise the ques- tion of whether a weed is really just a weed. Tell people about the plight of goldenseal, and remind them that the greatest curative gifts of this plant may yet to be discovered. Then tell them they can use Oregon grape as a substitute. On a personal level, you can accom- plish even more. Join organizations such as United Plant Savers, become involved with native plant clubs in your area, or become actively involved in land restora- tion efforts. If you use herbs, learn as much as you can about the plants and the ecosystems they live in. Above all, take time to evaluate and improve yourself as a consumer of our planet’s resources, and learn how to give something back for everything you consume. Herbs for Pets 44 Principles and Practices of Herbalism 45 AN A-Z GUIDE TO HERBS FOR ANIMALS T hese detailed monographs are specific to the identification, harvest, prepa- ration, and applications of the herbs we most frequently find useful in the care of animals. Please keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list of the herb resources that are available to you and your pet; it represents only a few that are most familiar to us and other herbalists who find themselves involved in the care of animals. To list and describe the hundreds of other potentially useful herbs that exist worldwide would be time and space prohibitive, if not impossible. Despite all measures of scientific study or clinical success that may be in place to validate and substantiate the efficacy and safety of an herb (or for that matter any medicine), it is important to remember that a golden rule must never be for- gotten: There are no absolutes in nature. Each individual animal is unique so no single herb can be relied upon to work at the same level of effectiveness in each and every animal. With this rule in mind, we have also included a supplemental herb list at the end of this chapter where you will find general information about several other herbs you may find useful in the care of your companion. The herbs in this list should not be overlooked as lesser or secondary options but as resources worthy of further investigation. Following is an explanation of the subheads: Appearance: Under this subheading is a brief physical description of the sub- ject plant. Please keep in mind that the plant descriptions we provide here are intended only to give you a general idea of what a specific plant looks like. This book is not intended to serve as a definitive means of plant identification. The process of accurately identifying a plant involves the use of a highly scientific botanical plant key that enables the user to systematically recognize or rule out char- acteristics that are unique to a species. To obtain a botanical key that is specific to Materia Medica Materia Medica Chapter 2 Herbs for Pets 48 plants in your area, visit your local library or obtain one from a bookstore. To learn how to use a botanical key, consider tak- ing an introductory botany class at your local college. Habitat and Range: Under this sub- heading we tell you where you can expect to find the subject plant growing in the wild. We may also mention which climatic regions are best suited to the cultivation of the plant. Cycle and Bloom Season: Here we inform you of the reproductive charac- teristics of the plant. Parts Used: Under this subheading we have listed the plant parts (leaves, root, etc.) that are most commonly used by herbalists. Primary Medicinal Activities: This is not an exhaustive list—most herbs offer dozens of medicinal activities, many of which may be too weak to be of thera- peutic value. Here we have listed the strongest and most predictable effects the herb is likely to produce when used in a healing context with most animals. Strongest Affinities: Under this sub- heading we have listed the body struc- tures or systems that are likely to benefit the most from the medicinal activities of the herb. Preparation: Here we have listed which types of medicinal preparation (infusion, alcohol tincture, glycerin tinc- ture, decoction, etc.) are best suited to the use of the herb. Common Uses: Under this subheading you will find the “meat” of the mono- graph. Here we identify and explain what we feel are the best applications for the herb. This information is a mix of personal opinion, hands-on experience, clinical observations, and scientific and anecdotal evidence. We’ve included information about scientific studies that we feel are espe- cially relevant to the use of herbs in ani- mals. We vehemently oppose any form of experimentation that imposes dis- comfort, disease, or a reduced quality of life upon an animal. Such experi- mentation violates the foundations of holistic healing—wellness cannot be Materia Medica 49 sustained from induced suffering. However, we also feel responsible to the animals who have already suffered or died at the hands of human science. We must do our best to assure that the knowledge we have gained from their past suffering is not wasted, and that every shred of useful knowledge that humanity has gained through their sac- rifices is used for other animals in the form of better care and better under- standing. In the realm of holistic heal- ing, there is no need or justification for future animal experimentation—but there is also no point in denying our- selves or our pets the understanding we have already attained, even if by dark, arrogant means. Availability: Here you will find infor- mation specific to where you can access the herb. Propagation and Harvest: Under this subheading is information about how to grow your own plants or how to harvest and handle the herb in the wild. If har- vesting wild plants interests you, please keep these three important rules in mind before embarking on any wildcrafting ventures: 1) Do not pick any plants that are endangered or scarce. 2) Beware of pesticides. Never gather plants from road- sides, cultivated fields, irrigation ditches, or other areas where weed control efforts may have taken place. 3) You must be 100 percent certain of the identity of the plant you are picking— before you pick it! Alternatives and Adjuncts: Under this subheading we list and categorize herbs that serve especially well as alter- natives or as complementary additions to the herb we have been discussing throughout the monograph. Cautions and Comments: Here you will find any contraindications or side effects that we are aware of. You will also find our comments and opinions relative to the overall safety or potential misuses of the herb.

Herbs for Pets 50 ALFALFA Medicago sativa Pea Family Appearance: Alfalfa is a sprawling mem- ber of the pea family (Leguminosae) with small, tightly arranged blue or sometimes pink or white flowers; small, prickly, seed- bearing pods; and cloverlike leaves. Habitat and Range: Widely cultivated throughout the world Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that first blooms in early summer, alfalfa continues to bloom after successive har- vests throughout the growing season as long as the climate permits vigorous regrowth. Parts Used: Dried leaves, stems, unopened flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Nu- tritive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, stimulates urination (diuretic) Strongest Affinities: Musculoskeletal system, digestive tract, liver Preparation: Capsules, infusion, liquid extract, or dried bulk herb sprinkled onto food Common Uses: Alfalfa contains a broad spectrum of nutrients, including consid- erable quantities of protein (up to 50 percent by weight), trace minerals, dietary fiber, and vitamins A, B1, B12, C, D, E, and K. It is also high in chlorophyll, which serves as an antioxidant in the bloodstream. All of this makes alfalfa par- ticularly attractive as a livestock feed. In addition to being highly nutritive, alfalfa is traditionally known as one of the best herbal treatments for arthritis, rheuma- tism, and gout. Clinical research of the use of alfalfa in treating these diseases has shown that at least 10 to 20 percent of human subjects experience dramatic reduction of painful symptoms. Tra- ditional uses in animals have commonly led to similar results. For arthritis and other inflammatory diseases of the joints, alfalfa can bring long-term relief to dogs, cats, rodents, and horses and various other herbivores who receive it as a daily food supplement. By now you probably see the value of this herb in the care of older animals. For use in therapeutic doses, it works well when combined with dandelion, yucca, and licorice. Alfalfa possesses cancer-preventive qualities as well. It is believed that alfalfa induces complex cellular activities that serve to inactivate chemical carcinogens in the liver and small intestine before they can cause damage, thus helping to reduce the risk of cancerous growths. Medicago sativa a Materia Medica 51 a Alfalfa’s considerable vitamin K con- tent has been shown to be beneficial in remedying bleeding disorders that may result from long-term use of antibiotics, anticoagulants, aspirin, and anticonvul- sant drugs. The coumarin constituent of alfalfa is also well known for its antico- agulant qualities, and in fact many anti- clotting drugs were derived from this compound. Excessive doses of fresh alfalfa or concentrated extracts may be contraindicated in animals with anemia, but moderate dietary supplementation may be useful in some types of this disease. The various saponin constituents of alfalfa are known to help with the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients in the small intestine and may act to stimulate the body’s natural production of growth hormones—yet another reason for its popularity as a livestock feed. In this capacity, alfalfa works by mechanisms very similar to those of yucca, but it is much less irritating to the stomach and intestines than yucca and therefore can be used over longer periods without adverse side effects. It may be especially useful in animals with debilitating dis- eases who need to gain weight but can- not afford added stress upon compro- mised body systems. In the urinary tract, alfalfa has an alka- linizing effect, making it useful in treat- ing ailments that involve overly acidic urine, especially where there is bladder irritation and crystal formation. This nutritional plant also helps an animal adjust to a new diet. For the brain, alfalfa is said to help improve mental vigor. This is likely due to alfalfa’s broad spectrum of nutrients, many of which are critical to proper nerve and brain functions. Availability: Health food stores; can be propagated in a home garden Propagation and Harvest: Alfalfa is extremely easy to grow just about any- where. In fact, if allowed to spread, it quickly becomes competitive with every- thing else in the garden. Being a legume, alfalfa changes nitrogen into a usable form within its extensive root system, making it a valuable soil-building ingre- dient when the plants are tilled in. Unfortunately, the weedlike character of this plant overshadows its value as a soil builder. Digging the roots is like pulling crabgrass, and tilling often results in even greater proliferation from the subsequent root cuttings. In other words, buy certified organic alfal- fa at an herb store, unless you wish to delegate a portion (or perhaps all) of your garden to it. (A word of caution to the insistent gardener: If you plant alfalfa and then have second thoughts about keeping it, remove it before it goes to seed. Once it does, it’s yours for life!) Gather alfalfa before it comes into bloom. Cut (or mow) the plants during dry weather, cutting the stems at about 1 inch above ground level. Allow the herb to dry in an airy, moisture-free place that is away from direct sunlight until it is completely dry, or make a tincture from the freshly cut greens. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Dan- delion, garlic, licorice, red clover, and yucca Cautions and Comments: Alfalfa is regarded as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although adverse side effects are rare, many horse owners testify that consumption of too much fresh alfalfa may lead to colic, a condition that can be serious in animals. This is due in large part to alfalfa’s saponin constituents. Although these soaplike compounds are medicinally Herbs for Pets 52 valuable, used in excess they may irritate the stomach lining and intestinal mucosa, resulting in nausea and gastri- tis. Horses and rabbits cannot vomit, which greatly compounds the serious- ness of this side effect. The risk of colic occurring is greatly reduced by feeding only dried greens. The seeds of alfalfa have been found to contain a toxic amino acid, l-canava- nine, which has caused blood disorders in humans and in animals. Use alfalfa only during its prebloom stages of growth. Alfalfa can trigger allergic responses in animals who are especially sensitive to pollens. ALOE Aloe spp. Lily Family Appearance: Aloes are cactuslike members of the lily family (Liliaceae), having narrow, tapering, proportion- ately thick, succulent leaves with spiny margins. There are perhaps five hun- dred species of aloe, but the most com- mon aloe of commerce is Aloe bar- badensis, which we commonly know as aloe vera. This species produces its leaves directly from a stout central stalk, in a rosette fashion, while several other varieties of aloe are branched, almost bushlike. Aside from these vari- ations, all aloes share a similar appear- ance and can grow very large. In some areas of southwestern Africa, aloes are seen in excess of 25 feet tall with stems more than 10 feet in circumference. Flowers are small, tubular, characteristi- cally lilylike in appearance, and are pro- duced in leafless, terminal spikes. Habitat and Range: Aloes are indige- nous to southern and eastern Africa and have been introduced to the West Indies, where a great deal of commercial culti- vation takes place. In areas of North America and Europe with Mediterranean climates, aloes are used as landscape and garden plants. They are popular indoor plants throughout much of the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: Aloes are perennials that bloom opportunistically when mature. In other words, if they receive all of the elements they require to thrive, they will likely remain in bloom throughout each year of their lives. Parts Used: Primarily the gel-like juice of the inner leaf or the yellowish latex contained immediately beneath the skin of the leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Wound healing (vulnerary), soothes skin (emol- lient), anti-bacterial, antioxidant, stimu- lates the immune system (immunostimu- lant), anticancer, antitumor, cooling to the skin. Strongest Affinities: Skin, digestive system, lymph system Preparation: Freshly pressed juice or stabilized (commercial) aloe gel prepara- tions are the most commonly used forms of aloe. Using this plant at home is as easy as cutting a mature leaf from the lower part of the plant and squeezing out the juice. Intravenous formulations of aloe ingredients have been FDA- approved and are available for use by veterinarians. Acemannan, a chemical compound found in aloe vera juice, is a powerful immunostimulant. Common Uses: Aloe’s great claim to fame is from its use as a topical skin dressing. Fresh aloe juice or commer- cially prepared gel contains dozens of minerals, proteins, enzymes, polysac- charides, and other elements that help a Materia Medica 53 a soften and soothe the skin and pro- mote the rapid healing of minor burns and wounds. Topical application of aloe gel will likely bring immediate, cooling relief to fleabites, poison ivy, and sunburns. It is also excellent for reducing the itch and tightening of postsurgical incisions. Applied after sutures are removed, the gel reduces much of the irritation that so often leads to persistent chewing or scratch- ing and may result in inflammation and infection. In any external application, apply enough juice to lightly cover the affected area and allow it to dry. If pos- sible, keep the animal from licking it off—the idea is to leave the juice on as long as possible. Unless your animal has an adverse reaction to the juice (such as reddening or an allergy rash), aloe can be applied liberally once or twice per day until the healing process is progressing well. Internally, a small dose of aloe juice may be useful for healing minor injuries and irritations of the digestive tract, such as those that may occur when Bowser swallows a jagged bone. Scientists have recently found that acemannan acts as a strong immunos- timulant in animals, particularly in cats. It has been found to be especially effec- tive in the treatment of fibrosarcoma and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). It is theorized that acemannan triggers an increase in the autoimmune attack upon the viruses believed to cause these usually fatal diseases. Typically, over 70 percent of cats who become ill with FeLV die within ten weeks of the onset of disease. But in a recent study, forty-four cats with confirmed FeLV were injected with 2 milligrams per kilogram of acemannan weekly for six weeks and reexamined six weeks after the treatment ended. At the end of the twelve-week study, 71 percent of the cats were alive and in good health. Acemannan has also been shown to be effective against cancerous tumors in rodents and dogs. It has been FDA approved for veterinary use and will undoubtedly be tested in humans. Other chemical compounds found in aloe juice have been shown to have antioxidant actions in the body. Availability: Aloe gel or juice (the dif- ference being consistency) is available at health food stores. Any good nursery has the plants. Propagation and Harvest: Aloe is easy to grow as a houseplant. It requires well-drained, sandy soil and should be watered only once or twice a month. Avoid using potting soil—it retains too much moisture and may cause rot prob- lems. Ordinary garden soil will do fine. A happy aloe that receives plenty of Aloe barbadensis Herbs for Pets 54 sunlight will bloom continuously and reproduce aggressively from side-shoots. These shoots are easily transplanted into separate pots. If you live in an area where frost is rare, aloe can be planted in a gar- den. Again, just give it plenty of sun, don’t overwater it, and it will be yours forever. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Nothing really compares with aloe, but if you don’t have it around, look toward chick- weed, plantain, self-heal, and comfrey as topical alternatives. Internally, ginger, cayenne, red clover, cleavers, dandelion, yarrow, garlic, and burdock are worth considering to complement the activity of aloe. Cautions and Comments: Aloe juice, although bitter, is generally safe for inter- nal or external uses in dogs, cats and most other animal types. However, be cautious of any products containing “Aloes.” Aloes consists of a sticky latex that is extracted from the inner skin of aloe leaves. This latex possesses strong purgative qualities that may result in digestive distress and severe diarrhea. Although several commercial laxative preparations use aloe latex in their for- mulas, we strongly discourage their use in animals. It is believed that aloe com- ponents may be passed in mother’s milk to nursing infants, so it should not be used in such circumstances. ARNICA Arnica spp. Sunflower Family Appearance: Arnica is a classic sun- flower with bright yellow daisylike flow- ers. Leaves oppose one another on the stem and range from narrowly lance shaped to broadly heart shaped (depending on species). The leaves and stems of most species are at least partial- ly covered with fine hairs. Most arnicas are aromatic, particularly when the leaves are bruised, with a distinctive pinelike odor. Arnicas are small plants, seldom exceeding 12 inches in height. Habitat and Range: Arnica is a moun- tain plant that occurs in coniferous sub- alpine and alpine regions of western North America from Alaska to the moun- tains of southern California, where it grows only above 9,000 feet in elevation. Cycle and Bloom Season: Arnica is a perennial that blooms during its second year of growth and every year thereafter. It is among the first flowers to bloom in early spring and is often one of the first to die back in early summer. During dry years, arnica may not bloom at all. Parts Used: The entire flowering plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Heals wounds, dilates blood vessels Strongest Affinities: Muscles and subdermal capillaries Preparation: Oil infusion, water infu- sion, fresh poultice, or commercially pre- pared gel Common Uses: Arnica is used for closed-tissue injuries, including fractures, sprains, and contusions. It is perhaps the best-known herbal sports medicine. Used topically, preparations of arnica act to open up peripheral capillaries and lymph ducts and increase circulation in tissues that are engorged with fluids as a result of injury. When used immediately after an injury occurs, results can be dra- matic. In essence, arnica helps to speed the healing process by moving waste- bound fluids out and moving cleansing a Materia Medica 55 a fluids and platelets into the affected area. Arnica is especially valuable for treat- ment of horses and other large animals who are subjected to rigorous exercise and an occasional twist or strain of the leg or hip joints. Arnica can be used on dogs as well, but special measures must be taken to prohibit the animal from lick- ing it off because arnica can be toxic if taken internally in improper dosages. Cats are not excluded from the use of arnica, but they are more sensitive to arnica’s volatile oils and are more prone to allergic reactions with this herb as they are with so many other substances. Test a small portion of your cat’s skin before using arnica for an injury. Look for development of redness or other signs of irritation. To use arnica on a dog or cat, apply enough of the infusion or gel to wet the skin of the animal (not just the fur), then wrap the area with gauze or a piece of cloth and secure it so the animal cannot easily remove it. The idea is to keep the preparation on the animal as long as possible. Arnica can be applied this way twice daily for up to three days. Long- term applications should not be neces- sary and are not recommended because a rash is likely to develop from overuse. When used internally in carefully measured doses, arnica is said to act as a neurological device in cases of chronic urinary incontinence that cannot be attributed to physiological pathologies. While use of arnica in this capacity holds a great deal of promise for many animals suffering from urinary incontinence, the toxicity of this plant limits such use to the advanced professional. Talk with a holistic veterinarian if you are interested in this use. Although this book focuses on herbal remedies, the value of arnica in homeo- pathic preparations should not be over- looked. In a homeopathic capacity, arni- ca can be used internally with a great margin of safety. We have seen amazing results with the use of homeopathic arni- ca at the onset of traumatic injury in ani- mals, and keeping homeopathic arnica on hand is as simple as purchasing a small vial of the tiny white pellets and slipping it into your pocket, purse, or first aid kit. To learn more about using home- opathic arnica, we highly recommend Dr. Pitcairn’s Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs & Cats. Availability: Arnica gels and tinctures are readily available from herb retailers. Seeds are available from specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Arnica requires soil with plenty of organic mat- ter and does best when its root system can crawl around under a blanket of pine needles. Given that it is seldom found at Arnica cordifolia Herbs for Pets 56 altitudes under 3,000 feet except in Canada, it likely has some specialized light- or air-quality requirements that prohibit it from flourishing in urban areas. If you live in the mountains, arnica can be grown from seeds or root cut- tings. But beware—the roots will quickly consume your garden. To harvest arnica from the wild, grasp the stem of the flowering herb just above ground level, then snap it off, taking only what you need. Take care not to damage the roots by pulling on the plant or step- ping into a patch of plants—the roots crawl horizontally, and the pressure of a human foot can injure them. After gathering what you need, you have the option of processing them fresh or allowing them to dry in a dark place. Fresh plants yield a more potent infusion but spoil quickly in the refriger- ator because of their water content. Regardless, we opt for the use of fresh arnica. To learn how to make an oil infu- sion, refer to chapter 1. Another option for the use of arnica in emergency situations is to make a sim- ple poultice by mashing a flowering plant with some water to make a pesto- like paste. The poultice can then be applied to the injury as a crude oint- ment. It can really work wonders when you’re out on the trail—just bear in mind that animals (or people) should not ingest the poultice in any quantity. Alternative and Adjunct Herbs: Saint-John’s-wort, ginger, cayenne, and yarrow are good choices as internal adjunct therapies here. Saint-John’s-wort can be used topically as well and is espe- cially useful if nerve trauma is suspected. Cautions and Comments: Arnica can be toxic if ingested in anything but homeopathic or minute quantities and may cause internal bleeding if ingested in large enough quantities. Because arni- ca works quickly to stimulate dilation and circulation of peripheral blood ves- sels, it should not be applied to open, bleeding wounds. To do so might actual- ly increase bleeding and slow the coagu- lation process. Animals generally dislike the taste, but extra measures are war- ranted to prohibit dogs and cats from licking arnica-treated areas. ASTRAGALUS Astragalus membranaceous Pea Family Appearance: A typical member of the pea family, astragalus has finely divided leaves, small pealike flowers and seed pods, and a sprawling, vinelike stature that brings to mind any of the hundreds of wild vetches that inhabit much of the globe. Astragalus membranaceous, the species of commerce, may grow as tall as 6 feet, which gives it an appearance that is similar to licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.), yet another member of the pea family. There is a growing belief among herbalists, botanists, and medical researchers that North American milk vetch (A. americana), a common weed, may have similar medic- inal attributes and may even be the same plant as A. membranaceous, the medicinal astragalus of commerce. The Astragalus genus is large, consisting of hundreds of species, which in many cases are difficult to differentiate even by trained botanists. Some varieties of Astragalus are toxic, and to compound this mystery even more, these plants often cross-pollinate and hybridize. For now, no one knows whether or not we have a wild, medicinal Astragalus in North America. Habitat and Range: An import from China, Astragalus has been cultivated throughout much of the world as an important herb of commerce. a Materia Medica 57 a Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from spring to early summer Parts Used: Mature (at least three years old) roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Immuno-stimulant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, mildly depresses thyroid func- tion (hypothyroid), lowers blood pres- sure (hypotensive), aids blood cleansing (alterative), strengthens digestion Strongest Affinities: Immune system, lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, thyroid, digestive tract Preparation: Tincture or infusion Common Uses: One of the best known and widely used herbs in Chinese medi- cine (where the herb is known as huang qi), astragalus has found its way into Western herbalism by virtue of its widely versatile immune-strengthening qualities. In Chinese medicine, astragalus root is considered sweet and mildly warm, tonify- ing the qi (pronounced “chee”) and hoist- ing the yang. (Sweet and warm are terms used in Chinese medicine to describe an herb’s relation to the body’s energy flows and do not relate to flavor.) Astragalus root is commonly used for spleen and lung qi deficiency, including symptoms of emacia- tion, weariness, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and prolapse of the uterus or anus. Astragalus is especially useful for strengthening the body against viral infections of the respiratory tract and heart through stimulation of killer-cell activity and interferon production in the body. It imparts direct antibacterial and anti-inflammatory qualities to this effort as well. Astragalus is a viable option for early treatment of various forms of respiratory infection, including kennel cough (Borde- tella bronchiseptica), a condition that the- oretically involves this bacterium’s oppor- tunistic cooperation with various forms of virus. While astragalus works to stimulate T cell activity and helps to raise white blood cell counts, it also boosts the body’s defenses through its liver-strengthening attributes. In a study involving rats, saponin constituents were shown to enhance DNA synthesis in the liver—a process believed to be a major factor in the strengthening of cell structures against infection or the introduction of toxins. Other studies suggest that astra- galus may be useful for helping the body protect itself and speed recovery from the damaging effects of long-term steroid therapies. Astragalus is known to strengthen kidney circulation, making it useful in early stages of kidney infection or renal failure. For any of the aforementioned purpos- es, up to 20 drops of the extract can be Astragalus membranaceous Herbs for Pets 58 administered for each 20 pounds of your animal’s body weight, up to twice daily. In addition to its broad-spectrum abili- ty to boost resistance to disease, astragalus is traditionally used to boost energy levels in debilitated people and animals, which adds to its promise as a candidate in the treatment of various cancers, especially those compounded by depressed immune functions. For pet owners who are going through the horrors of chemotherapy or radiation treatments for their animals, astragalus may offer a foothold in main- taining some functional balance in an immune system that is stressed by both a disease and toxic intervention. To use astragalus in this capacity, first consult a holistic veterinarian. Astragalus is also known to have antivi- ral qualities that are specific to infections of the heart. Again, if you suspect a problem of this serious nature, talk to a holistic vet- erinarian. Availability: Astragalus is available through many herb retailers. The seed can be purchased from specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Astragalus is easy to grow from seed—some rich soil, full sun, and ample watering are all it requires to thrive. If you decide to grow this plant in your garden, however, choose a place where it can remain for quite some time. Astragalus roots require three or more years to reach their full medicinal potential, and during this time, the plants will likely spread throughout the area where they were planted. Do not plant astragalus unless you are certain that the seed you have is in fact A. membrana- ceous, and do not plant astragalus if you live in an area where soils have a high sele- nium (a nonmetallic element) content. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For respira- tory infections, astragalus combines well with coltsfoot, grindelia, or mullein leaf. For kidney infections or dysfunction, couch grass, corn silk, pipsissewa, and goldenrod are noteworthy adjuncts. For use in situations involving liver toxicity, cancer, or depressed immune functions, gentle tonic herbs with diuretic, alterative, and nutritive qualities are indicated to help remove toxins and excess waste from the body. Dandelion, burdock, red clover, licorice, and alfalfa are excellent herbs to investigate. For an overactive thyroid, Astragalus works well by itself, but if you don’t have access to any, an alternative choice might be bugleweed. Cautions and Comments: While A. membranaceous, the medicinal variety of Astragalus, is among the safest of medici- nal herbs for both humans and animals, many other species of Astragalus are toxic, especially to grazing animals. Buy astra- galus roots, preparations, and seeds only from reputable sources. Also, astragalus is known to accumulate selenium in its tissues in areas where a high selenium content is present in the soil. Selenium can be toxic in high doses. Check with your county extension agent before planting this herb. In Chinese medicine, astragalus is con- traindicated in “excess heat” and “yin deficiency” patterns. BEE BALM Monarda spp. Mint Family Appearance: This pungent genus of dry land mints is known by many common names: wild bergamot, purple bee balm, horsemint, wild oregano, Oswego tea, and sweet leaf. Leaves are lance shaped, oppose one another on the stem, and have a tendency to curve backward toward the ground. Leaf margins are B Materia Medica 59 b sometimes, but not always, toothed. Like most members of the mint family, the stems of bee balm are distinctively square (four-sided). Flowers are presented in clusters at the top of the plant, each con- taining dozens of tiny, rose- to purple-col- ored blossoms. Perhaps the most distin- guishing characteristic of this plant is its strong but pleasant odor, which ranges from sweetly sagelike to that which leads many to believe they have discovered a wild strain of oregano. The plant can grow to 3 feet on its sturdy stems, but most are found in the range of 6 to 18 inches tall. Habitat and Range: Wild bee balm likes meadows and slopes that are predomi- nantly dry and sunny. Unlike most mints, bee balm is drought tolerant and prefers dry land habitats. Bee balm (M. fistulosa) is generally found at elevations below 4,000 feet. Other varieties of Monarda, such as M. menthaefolia, grow at higher elevations in shady, moist soils. The range of this plant remains largely undefined, but in the U.S. it seems to be spreading westward from the east. Livestock enjoy grazing on this plant and have undoubtedly served as a vehicle in the expansion of bee balm’s range. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms by midsummer and often con- tinues to bloom until the first frost Parts Used: Leaves plucked from the plant; the entire aerial plant if the stem is taken Primary Medicinal Activities: pro- motes sweating (diaphoretic), expels intes- tinal gas (carminative), antiseptic, reduces pain (analgesic), antifungal Strongest Affinities: Skin, mouth, di- gestive tract, kidneys, urinary tract Preparation: Unlike most leafy herbs, which begin to break down and lose their potency after about six months, bee balm can be dried and stored for up to two years. The fresh or dried leaf, stem, and flower material can be made into an alco- hol or glycerin tincture. The dried plant can be infused for use in skin and eyewashes. Common Uses: Although this plant is widely available and infinitely useful, it is often overlooked by herbalists, and it has not received the clinical study that it deserves as a healing ally. Despite an over- all lack of scientific validation, bee balm is a safe herb to use in both animals and humans. Many North American Indian tribes used this plant extensively for heal- ing and in spiritual ceremonies. Like most mints, bee balm has a special affinity toward the digestive tract, where it Monarda fistulosa Herbs for Pets 60 is useful for relieving gastritis and spastic colon. However, it does not taste good, and most herbivores abandon it in favor of less pungent forage. Therefore, for use as a digestive aid in animals, the best form of administering bee balm is gelatin capsules (gel capsules) or a glycerin extract. Bee balm has excellent antibacterial qualities and is especially useful for mouth and gum infections. Two methods of appli- cation work here: a poultice can be made from the dried or fresh herb and applied directly to the affected area, or a strong infusion or tincture can be used the same way. The poultice or infusion can also be effective as an antifungal agent. Dogs, cats, and horses and other large animals with fun- gal infections of the skin are likely to benefit from a generous topical application of bee balm poultice or salve or from twice-daily skin rinses with cooled bee balm tea (also see “Calendula”). To make the tea, cover a generous handful of the herb with hot water and allow it to steep until the water has thoroughly cooled. Don’t worry about straining the herb—just pour the entire mix- ture over the affected areas of the animal. In dry weather, or in cases where the animal chooses to lick the rinse off before it can be effective, you might consider applying the tea as a fomentation (see chapter 1). Bee balm skin rinses also can bring soothing relief to itchy skin that has resulted from infected fleabites or spontaneous dermatitis (commonly caused by poison ivy, nettle stings, or contact allergic reactions) and help to relieve pain while reducing scarring from minor burns. The rinse also imparts a pleasant odor to your pet. In large animals, bee balm tea can be used as a douche or enema to treat fungal or bacterial infections, or to treat irritations of the rectum or vagina. A dilute infusion can be used as a gentle antiseptic and anti-inflammatory eyewash or ear wash, especially if a fungal or bacteri- al infection is suspected. For application in the eye, don’t make the infusion too strong—it should be only light yellow in color. Rinse the eye and surrounding tissues with the use of an irrigation syringe. To add stronger antimicrobial activity to the rinse, a pinch of dried Oregon grape root or certi- fied organic goldenseal can be added to the infusion while it is steeping. Just remember to keep the eye rinse very weak. Ear rinses can be made much stronger. Bee balm works well for low-grade uri- nary tract infections, and you might find it useful for kidney infections as well. Unless you can get your animal to drink the tea, a glycerin-based tincture is probably your best bet: administer 12–25 drops per 20 pounds of animal weight two to three times per day. Availability: Wild harvested or organically grown bee balm is available through herb retailers, as is the tincture. Seeds and plants can be purchased through specialty cata- logs and nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Bee balm reseeds readily and transplants well. This is an excellent plant to introduce into your herb garden. No stratification or other spe- cial treatment is required, and the plant is adaptable to almost any soil. Gather the upper parts of this plant when it is in full bloom (May through September, depend- ing on location), which is when the parts are the most potent. Pluck individual leaves to minimize impact, or gather the stem and leaves after the plant has bloomed and gone to seed. If the latter is your choice, clip the stems about 1 inch above ground level to allow for perennial regrowth and root pro- tection. When gathering while the plant is in bloom, always be sure to leave plenty of flowers intact for pollination and seed development. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Combines well with catnip, chamomile, or fennel for digestive upsets and gas. Works well as an B Materia Medica 61 b infusion with echinacea, couch grass, rasp- berry leaf, or goldenrod for urinary or kidney disorders. As a skin rinse, bee balm serves as a good base infusion to which feverfew flowers can be added for control of fleas. Cautions and Comments: Bee balm is a safe herb, but it often grows in areas that are heavily grazed by livestock, where the pres- ence of neighboring weeds may have led to the introduction of herbicides. Always check or ask for evidence of spraying before you harvest. BLACK WALNUT Juglans nigra Walnut Family Appearance: A large tree that may grow to 120 feet, black walnut is char- acterized by its 6-inch- to 2-foot-long leaves, which are each divided several times into twelve to twenty-four, lance- shaped and toothed leaflets. Fruits are presented as green orbs with fleshy outer husks that later dry into very hard dark-brown nuts. Habitat and Range: Common through- out eastern North America; sporadically distributed throughout the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas; introduced as an ornamental tree in most other regions of the U.S. and southern Canada Cycle and Bloom Season: Blooms in spring; bears fruit beginning in early summer Parts Used: Primarily the green (un- ripe) outer fruit hulls Primary Medicinal Activities: expels worms (anthelmintic), tightens skin and mucous membranes (astrin- gent), may induce vomiting (emetic), laxative Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, skin Preparation: Extract of the green, unripe hulls Common Uses: Our purpose for in- cluding black walnut in this herbal repertory for animals is as much to dis- courage its misuse as it is to express its medicinal attributes. Black walnut hull extract is unquestionably one of the best and safest worming agents offered by the plant world. But like many sub- stances that can actually make a tape- worm hate life, it can be toxic to the host if not used with proper care, cau- tion, and training. Black walnut offers symptomatic worm intervention that is generally safer and kinder to the host animal than most other herbal Juglans nigra Herbs for Pets 62 wormers. The holistically minded pet owner should also take into account that such intervention is actually con- trary to the holistic principles of using herbs in a natural context. Black walnut kills and expels tapeworms, but the underlying reasons an animal is infested with an overpopulation of these oppor- tunity-seeking parasites in the first place is not addressed. For more on the prin- ciples we are referring to, and our rec- ommended approaches to parasite con- trol, please read the section “Parasite- Related Problems” in chapter 3. For now, we must tell you that black wal- nut, although safe and effective when used in the correct dose and where indicated by specific circumstances, is an herb best reserved for use by experi- enced practitioners. Availability: Black walnut is available in the form of an alcohol tincture from several human-oriented herb product companies. Black walnut is also used in several over-the-counter wormers, most of which we do not recommend by virtue of holistic principles. Propagation and Harvest: Black walnut is a beautiful, full-sized shade tree that can be purchased from many landscape nurseries and fruit tree cata- logs. The green, unripe fruit hulls are harvested while they remain fleshy, in early to late spring. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Garlic and raw pumpkin seeds, added to a good natural diet, are the better choic- es for worm control in the majority of circumstances. Cautions and Comments: Black wal- nut can be toxic to horses and may cause laminitis, severe gastritis, and breathing problems in these animals. These problems are believed to be caused not by the hulls themselves but by a fungus that attacks the green fruit hulls shortly after they fall to the ground. While this suggests that the properly harvested, fungus-free hulls may be safe for use in horses, we are often left with an unanswerable ques- tion of whether or not the hulls we are using are in fact clean of this fungus. Problems have been recorded in cases where horses had merely used black walnut shavings as part of their bed- ding! Concentrations of strong tannins, volatile oils, and various alkaloid ingre- dients contained in the bark, leaves, stems, and hulls of black walnut may lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and gastritis in dogs and cats if ingested in excessive quantities. Remember, anything that can kill a tapeworm has the potential of being harmful to your animal. BORAGE Borago officinalis Borage Family Appearance: Borage looks similar to its relative comfrey except borage has a more unruly stature. Plants may grow to 3 feet tall and quickly sprawl all over a flower bed shortly after rocketing skyward from their emergence as flattened, well-mannered lit- tle rosettes of basal leaves. The unique, 2- to 6-inch-long broadly lance-shaped or nar- rowly oval leaves have wrinkled, prickly haired surfaces that bring to mind two-day- old beard stubble. Flowers are brilliant blue, with five petals and a black-tipped conelike structure at the center of each flower. Flowers are borne in drooping clusters at the upper branches of the plant. Habitat and Range: Native to many parts of Europe and Asia, borage has been widely introduced as a garden plant in North America. It grows just about B Materia Medica 63 b anywhere that has a long enough bloom season to allow for seed development— basically, from the midlatitudes of Canada southward. Cycle and Bloom Season: Borage is a self-seeding annual that blooms from spring to midsummer in most areas. Parts Used: Leaves, flowers, and the oil extracted from seeds Primary Medicinal Activities: Stimulates milk production (galactagogue), stimulates mucous secretions in the bronchi (expecto- rant), astringent, anti-inflammatory, diuret- ic, mildly calming to the nerves, adrenal stimulant Strongest Affinities: Adrenal glands Preparation: The most common uses of this plant require extracting oil from the seed—a process that is impractical for the do-it-yourself herbalist. The leaves can be dried and used within three months for infusions, in capsules, or in bulk form pow- dered and added to your pet’s food. Dried leaves lose their medicinal qualities rather quickly, so use this herb as early after drying as possible. Fresh leaves can be scraped of their prickly hairs and made into a poultice or briefly steamed in their entire form for use as a warm cover dressing for overexerted muscles and minor skin inflammations. Although fresh borage can be fed to horses and other herbivores, most animals dislike the prickly texture of the foliage. Common Uses: Borage is one of many herbs that have been in traditional use for many centuries but nonetheless has not received the scientific attention it deserves. What we do know about borage is that its seeds contain impressive amounts of EFAs, especially gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a compound that has proven to be extreme- ly useful in the treatment of various liver, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. In fact, borage seed oil may contain twice the GLA offered by the oil of evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) seeds. The use of evening primrose should be avoided in sub- jects with blood-clotting disorders. Some scientists claim that the GLA in evening primrose oil can decrease blood cholesterol and blood pressure and cure rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies suggest that EFA deficien- cies may be strongly associated with many chronic diseases in both people and ani- mals, including atopic eczema, diabetes, and various inflammatory disorders. In dogs and cats, fatty acid disorders are character- ized in the early phases by a dull coat, itchy skin, and excessive shedding. Gamma- linolenic acid is important in the production of prostaglandins, compounds that are Borago officinalis Herbs for Pets 64 critical to the healthy performance of countless metabolic functions—from break- down of carbohydrates, fats, and other essential nutrients into usable forms, to maintenance of cellular integrity and prop- er functioning of smooth-muscle tissues (including the heart, uterus, and vascular system) throughout the body. In other words, animals cannot survive without a proper balance of fatty acids, including GLA, in their bodies. The body does not produce GLA, and therefore it must be received through dietary sources. The problem is that GLA is relatively rare in nature—it occurs in only a few vegetable sources. Borage seed oil is one of the richest GLA supplements avail- able and can be easily administered by breaking a gel capsule onto your pet’s food each day. Ask your holistic veterinarian for recommendations on how much of the oil your animal may need. Borage leaf has also received attention from herbalists who believe that it may be useful for gently strengthening adrenal function, particularly in subjects who have recently undergone extended steroid thera- pies. The adrenal cortex (the outer tissues of the adrenal glands) is chiefly responsible for the body’s production of corticosteroids, the hormones responsible for natural reduction of inflammation. When synthetic corticosteroids are introduced into the body, natural adrenal functions are replaced and the adrenal cortex often begins to shut down its natural production. As a result, many animals who are ending prednisolone or other steroid therapies have depressed adrenal function. Fat metabolism and mineral balances may also be affected if this happens. While borage is by no means as powerful as licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.) in its adrenal-stimulatory actions, it is believed by many herbalists to gently stimulate adrenal function that is slightly depressed, especially when used over an extended period. It may be particularly useful in cases where water retention and high blood pressure are prevalent in an animal’s holistic condition. In these situations, the stronger herb licorice may be contraindicated because of its potential side effects. While the use of borage in this capacity lacks scientific vali- dation, it has nonetheless been used safely and effectively for hundreds of years. The dried leaves may be tinctured (12 drops per 20 pounds of body weight, twice daily) or fed in bulk form (1⁄2 teaspoon sprinkled onto each pound of your animal’s food). Borage also has a folkloric reputation for increasing milk production in nursing mothers (both human and otherwise)—an action that may be attributable to increased hormone production by the adrenal gland. Topically, borage leaves can be applied as a soothing poultice or compress for minor skin irritations. To sum up its poten- tial for topical use, consider borage as a lim- ited alternative to comfrey. Availability: Virtually any nursery or seed catalog that sells herbs is likely to have borage. Propagation and Harvest: Borage prefers dry soil and full sun. Aside from these requirements, it is extremely easy to grow from seed or nursery-raised trans- plants. If you choose to transplant borage from one part of a garden to another, do it while the plants are young because the tap- root grows straight down and is easily dam- aged when removed from the soil. Borage is a successful self-seeding annu- al that drops thousands of tiny seeds almost immediately after blooming. Give the plant plenty of room to sprawl, and consider planting it with other annuals because it may become a nuisance when dozens of young plants emerge beneath your peren- nials during the second year. Harvest the mature leaves while the plant is in full bloom. Borage leaves are B Materia Medica 65 b especially susceptible to mold while they are drying, so never harvest when the leaves are wet and never stack the leaves on top of each other. Dry them in an area that is away from direct sunlight and has plenty of air circulation. Spread the leaves on clean newspapers or a nonmetallic screen and turn them once or twice daily to assure quick, even drying. The dried leaves can then be crumbled and stored in a glass jar for up to three months before they begin to lose their usefulness. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For similar topical applications, look toward comfrey, which is perhaps a more effective alterna- tive when indicated. For anti-inflammatory applications and situations involving depressed adrenal function, such as with Addison’s disease, look toward licorice and astragalus as stronger alternatives. Cautions and Comments: The leaves of this plant contain small amounts of PAs, a potentially toxic group of compounds that may lead to liver damage. Although the presence of these alkaloids in borage is very low (much lower than in comfrey) and require ingestion of large and sustained quantities to become harmful in most ani- mals, borage has nonetheless been banned from human use in Germany. BUGLEWEED Lycopus spp. Mint Family Appearance: Bugleweed also goes by the name of water horehound. The deeply and irregularly lobed leaves of Lycopus americanus differentiate it from other mints (and even other species of Lycopus). Other species of bugleweed (such as the less common L. uniflorus and L. asper) have leaves that are not deep- ly lobed but are simple and coarsely toothed, making them difficult to differ- entiate from other mints such as skull- cap. The easily identified L. americanus remains by far the most common and conspicuous variety in North America, making it the bugleweed to remember. Bugleweed, unlike many other mints, does not have a minty odor. Small whitish to pink flowers are whorled in the leaf axils (the point at which the leaf meets the stem). Stems may be lightly to moderately hairy, especially toward the base of the plant. Habitat and Range: An inhabitant of stream banks and marshes, bugleweed is typically found in the shade beneath wil- lows and other shrubs. Several species of Lycopus are widespread throughout most of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennial, blooming from early to midsummer Lycopus americanus Herbs for Pets 66 Parts Used: Leaves, stems, flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Slows thyroid function, mild cardiac sedative, calms nerves, diuretic, constricts subcu- taneous blood vessels, astringent, cough suppressant Strongest Affinities: Thyroid glands, heart, nervous system Preparation: Although this herb may be useful in dried bulk form or in cap- sules, it doesn’t taste very good, and it may be difficult to administer to a dog or cat in an appreciable quantity that doesn’t just pass through the short digestive tract. An alcohol or glycerin tincture is your best choice here. Common Uses: Although relatively lit- tle research has been done to validate bugleweed’s usefulness in animal sub- jects, it may prove useful in dogs and cats with hyperthyroid conditions. While bugleweed cannot physically correct a diseased thyroid gland and does not work as quickly as synthetic drugs, human studies have confirmed that bugleweed slows the release of the hor- mone thyroxine in the thyroid, making it useful in the treatment of mild forms of hyperthyroidism. Specifically, it should help ease abnormal excitability, relieve acute hyperventilation, slow a rapid heart rate, and relieve spastic coughing in dogs and cats who suffer from sponta- neous hyperthyroidism. It should be noted, though, that small, frequent doses of the herb extract must be given for a period of at least a few days before results are seen. Giving 2–6 drops per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight three times daily is a good starting point. Bugleweed is also useful in many heart and vascular system disorders. It is believed to work in the cardiovascular system in a way that is similar to the drug digitalis—by strengthening the heartbeat while slowing a rapid pulse. But unlike digitalis and other such drugs that are used primarily in humans, bugleweed is virtually free of dangerous side effects. Adding to bugleweed’s usefulness in cardiovascular disorders is its ability to help expel water from the body. This makes it useful in animals with lung fluid associated with weak, rapid pulse and unproductive coughing. However, some extra caution is advised here: bugleweed is believed to suppress the cough response even if such suppres- sion is not conducive to the healing process. In respiratory disorders such as Bordetella or pneumonia, cough sup- pression may be contradictory to the holistic principles of using herbs in the first place and may even be dangerous to the animal. Remember, the primary goal of herbal therapies is to assist the body in its capacity to heal itself, not to interfere with its efforts to do so. If the animal is successful at expelling mucus as a result of persistent coughing, the body is doing its job, and the use of bugleweed is probably contraindicated. See a holistic vet. The nerve-calming and vasoconstric- tor actions of bugleweed make it useful for pain relief in situations that involve irritability and tension. This is true espe- cially when circumstances are com- pounded by injured nerves such as in posttraumatic circumstances where an animal is in pain from a crushing injury, is jumpy and cannot get comfortable, and just paces, whines, and pants. Bugleweed does not contain salicylates, so it can be used for posttraumatic pain relief in cats. It is especially useful in cats with preexisting functional thyroid adenoma or other forms of disease that may contribute to an overactive B Materia Medica 67 b thyroid. In humans, bugleweed is often used by herbalists in the treatment of migraine headaches. Availability: Seeds are available from specialty seed catalogs. Bugleweed herb and herb tinctures are available through natural products retailers. Propagation and Harvest: This herb requires consistently moist soil and at least 50 percent shade cover. For the best results, sow the seeds indoors in February or March then transplant them to an area that gets plenty of shade and water throughout the sum- mer. Plants are ready to harvest when the flowers are just beginning to bloom. The freshly cut herb is the best choice for making your own medicine, but if this isn’t possible, cut the stems at about 3 inches above ground level dur- ing a period when the foliage is com- pletely dry. Hang them in small bunch- es of four to six stems apiece in an airy location away from direct sunlight. When properly stored, the dried herb retains its medicinal potency for at least six months. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For use in hyperthyroidism, bugleweed com- bines especially well with lemon balm (Melissa officinalis). For use in heart and vascular disorders associated with a rapid, erratic pulse, ginkgo and mother- wort serve as substitutes in many cases, and skullcap, hawthorn, garlic, and astragalus should all be investigated as adjuncts. For nervousness associated with abnormal irritability, pain, or rapid heartbeat, bugleweed will combine nicely with valerian, skullcap, hop, or chamomile. When water retention is an associated factor in any of the above conditions, try adding dandelion leaf to the formula as a diuretic aid. Cautions and Comments: Like all members of the mint family, bugleweed is a safe herb with no known toxicity when used sensibly. However, since bugleweed constricts blood vessels and may have hormonal properties, common sense dictates that it should not be used in pregnant or nursing animals. For obvi- ous reasons, bugleweed should not be used in animals with depressed thyroid function. Another point to consider before using bugleweed in your pet is that very little research has been done into the attributes and side effects of bugleweed in some animals. Although it can be safely used in most dogs, cats, and horses, its effects in birds, rodents, and other animals are largely unknown. If in doubt, contact a professional who is familiar with the specific applications of this herb. BURDOCK Arctium lappa Sunflower Family or A. minor Appearance: In its first year of growth, burdock appears as a rosette of large heart-shaped leaves up to 12 inches long. During the second year, the plant continues skyward, often reaching 6–8 feet, while branching out to produce multitudes of thistlelike, light lavender to purple-flowered seed-bearing burrs at the upper reaches of the plant. Each burr contains several small black seeds and is covered by reverse-hooked spines that enable them to stick to anything that brushes by. The entire plant is covered with tiny hairs that give the leaves and the stems a tacky texture similar to that of ultrafine grit sandpaper. The light- brown taproot may weigh 2–3 pounds and extend 2 or more feet below a sec- ond-year plant. This sturdy taproot, combined with the annoying and Herbs for Pets 68 extremely efficient reproductive qualities of the burrs, has earned burdock a hated reputation as a farm and garden enemy. Habitat and Range: Burdock is a Eurasian import that has made its home throughout most of North America. It prefers rich, deep, consistently moist soil and is frequently found in profuse abun- dance along the edges of cultivated fields and at roadsides (particularly where human or livestock traffic can cooperate with the hitchhiking burrs). Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial that blooms in mid- to late summer Parts Used: Root Primary Medicinal Activities: Blood cleansing, liver and gallbladder stimu- lant, diuretic, nutritive Strongest Affinities: Liver, skin Preparation: Although all preparations of this herb are useful, the active con- stituents of this plant must be given in relatively large doses to be of therapeutic advantage. Since most animals don’t like eating it, a strong tincture of fresh or dried root is the most effective prepara- tion. The medicinal ingredients of bur- dock root are extracted well in a glycerin menstruum (solvent), and the flavor of the resulting liquid, or glycerite, is sweet and agreeable to most animals. The fresh roots have a high water content, which is imparted to the finished tincture. A tinc- ture that contains more than 40 percent water spoils quickly. Therefore, it is best to use 100 percent undiluted vegetable glycerin in your mixture. Fresh or dried burdock root can be decocted, as well, and poured over your animal’s food. Be liberal with the quantity—burdock is a healthy food. Common Uses: We cannot emphasize the value of this herb enough in the long-term care of companion animals. Burdock has an ancient and respected reputation as a nutritive liver tonic that helps to clean and build the blood. Just 2.5 ounces of fresh burdock root con- tains up to 61 milligrams of calcium, 77 milligrams of phosphorus, 1.4 milligrams of iron, 0.03 milligrams of thiamine, and 0.05 milligrams of riboflavin. Burdock root is a specific treatment for chronic or acute psoriasis or eczema; it has a strong affinity toward the treat- ment of flaky, oily, or inflammatory skin disorders that can be traced back to liver deficiencies or a general overload of toxic substances in the body (usually the result of a poor diet). It is also useful in the holistic treatment of arthritis, rheumatoid disorders, inflammatory kid- ney and bladder diseases, and virtually any other type of metabolic disorder that may be the result of poor waste elimina- tion. Adding to all of this is a diuretic action that helps in the elimination of waste materials from the body. In simple terms, burdock helps clean the body from the inside out. Burdock contains chemical elements that have been shown to be effective in preventing disease that may result from environmental toxicity. Specifically, bur- dock helps to remove mutagenic sub- stances such as pesticides and airborne pollutants from the bloodstream before they cause harm to the body. Animal studies have indicated that burdock extract has free-radical scavenging quali- ties in the liver, thus weeding out car- cinogenic elements before cellular dam- age can occur. Virtually every living creature is con- tinually subjected to the harmful effects of human society—our companion ani- mals are no exception. The liver is the organ that begins the cleansing process. B Materia Medica 69 b The liver not only filters the blood but contributes bile and numerous enzymes to the digestive tract that are essential to the breakdown and absorption of essen- tial nutrients. By assisting liver function and prompting the efficient removal of systemic waste, absorbed or ingested toxins, and allergens from the body, imbalances such as arthritis, kidney stones, bladder infections, and eczema can be avoided. By helping the liver do its job, we are also relieving pressure from secondary immune functions that need to remain unencumbered in their fight against viruses and other microbes that may have bypassed the liver. Furthermore, if the liver can work at opti- mum efficiency, less solid or toxic waste will reach the kidneys—a set of delicate organs that are vulnerable to the liver’s deficiencies. Burdock is an excellent long-term liver tonic, and it is gentle enough to use in cases of preexisting liver or kidney dis- ease. It is an excellent choice for animals suffering as a result of a poor diet. Just remember, diet is where the road to a long, healthy life begins. Burdock will not replace a good natural diet, but it can help tremendously in allowing the body to utilize the good nutrition it receives. Availability: Fresh organically grown burdock root is available at many health food stores. Dried burdock root and root tincture are available through most herb retailers. Seeds are available through specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Provided you have deep, rich soil for taproots that can penetrate the earth 3 feet, burdock is easy to grow. Burdock likes moist (but not wet) soil, and it prefers to have at least a couple of hours of shade each day. Sow the seeds as you would carrots, in early spring. The roots are ready after the leaves die back in the fall of the first year. Second-year roots can be used if dug in the spring, but remember that biennials die after their second year of growth and the roots lose potency as they approach their demise. Burdock roots can be refrigerated for several weeks after harvest, or they can be chopped and dried, made into tinc- ture, or decocted for immediate use. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Dandelion root serves well as an alternative to bur- dock. For treatment of flaky or itchy skin problems, burdock can be supplement- ed with licorice, red clover, dandelion, or yellow dock. As a liver aid in conditions associated with chronic constipation, burdock can be supplemented with dan- delion, chicory, turkey rhubarb, yellow dock, or Oregon grape. In cases of pre- existing liver damage resulting from chemical toxicity or vaccinosis, use the Arctium minor Herbs for Pets 70 burdock with milk thistle or licorice. As an adjunct to an immune-support for- mula, combine burdock with echinacea or astragalus. Cautions and Comments: This is one of the safest herbs available to humans and animals. In essence, burdock is a nutraceutical, a food that also offers medicinal attributes. No toxicity has been noted with this herb. CALENDULA Calendula officinalis Sunflower Family Appearance: This herb is also known as pot marigold. The bright yellow, orange, or red-orange flowers of calen- dula are a familiar sight in gardens and landscape designs found everywhere. Calendula officinalis is a small plant that seldom exceeds 18 inches in height. The lance-shaped or oblong alternate leaves have coarse surfaces and are borne on sturdy branching stems. Calendula should not be confused with other marigolds, namely French marigolds, and other members of the Tagetes genus of the sunflower family, which have a pungent odor and much different leaf characteristics. Habitat and Range: Originally a native of Europe and Africa, calendula is a culti- vated plant throughout most of the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: The word calendula is derived from calends (the first day of the Roman month) because the plant was thought to bloom on the new moon of each month. While calen- dula really doesn’t keep such an accurate calendar, it does remain in a constant and generous state of bloom throughout most of its annual life span. Parts Used: Flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- inflammatory, increases lymph circula- tion, heals wounds, astringent, antibac- terial, antifungal, anti-tumor, liver stimu- lant, promotes menstruation (emmena- gogue) Strongest Affinities: Skin and mucous membranes Preparation: Water or oil infusion, tinc- ture, poultice, salve, ointment Common Uses: Calendula is among the first herbs to consider in minor first aid situations. A broad array of medicinal compounds in the flowers of the plant (various essential oils, flavonoids, saponins, triterpene alcohols, carotenes, and others) combine to help speed cell reproduction and inhibit bacteria and fungi at the site of injury. For minor cuts, insect bites, abra- sions, and postsurgical incisions, a calen- dula salve applied externally brings quick, soothing relief to pain and swelling, while lending wound-healing, antimicrobial properties to the body’s healing effort. Infusions of the flowers are effective as a soothing and healing skin wash for various forms of inflamma- tory dermatitis, such as those caused by fleabites, poison ivy, eczema, and sun- burn. The infection-fighting, skin-healing nature of this plant makes it useful for treating burns as well. A cooled water infusion may be used as an eyewash for conjunctivitis, where the mild but pre- dictable astringency of the plant com- bines with its bacteria-fighting properties to reduce irritation and infection. To make an eyewash or skin rinse, refer to chapter 1. Internally, an infusion or tincture of the flower may be used in treating C Materia Medica 71 c inflammation or ulceration of the diges- tive or urinary tracts, where it serves in the drainage of lymph-engorged tissues and reduces inflammation. It may also prove beneficial in the treatment of can- didiasis, a fungal infection of the mucous membranes in the mouths and digestive tracts of birds, cats, horses, and some- times dogs. The antifungal qualities of this herb also make it a possible option for topical treatment of chromomycosis, a fungal infection of the skin in cows, horses, dogs, cats, and amphibians, or for the treatment of entomophthoromy- cosis, a fungal infection of the nostrils, mouth, or lips of horses. While virtually no scientific data exist to validate the effectiveness of calendula against these three forms of disease, calendula’s safety and reputed effectiveness as a broad- spectrum antifungal agent make it an option worth trying. Preparations containing calendula have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic colitis. And animal studies have shown that the saponin constituents in calendula may possess antitumor activities. Availability: Over thirty varieties of cal- endula are available at nurseries every- where. Propagation and Harvest: Sow seeds in early spring or transplant the starts after the danger of frost is past. Calendula likes moderately rich soil and full sun. It is not picky about pH—as long as the soil is not excessively alkaline or acidic, calendula will do just fine. Once established, plants self-sow from their prolific seed production. Seedlings that emerge each spring should be thinned to about 6 inches apart, so you can have a continuous, relatively carefree supply of calendula. Harvest the flowers when- ever they are in full bloom. They can then be made into an herbal preparation while they are fresh, or you can dry them indoors for use in the near future. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For use in first aid salves, calendula combines espe- cially well with comfrey and Saint-John’s- wort. To increase its effectiveness in anti- fungal uses (internally or externally), try adding bee balm, Oregon grape, or licorice. For urinary or digestive tract inflammations, calendula can be coupled with corn silk, marshmallow, or plantain. Cautions and Comments: Although calendula is without question one of the safest herbs, it does have a reputation for stimulating menstruation. In some stud- ies it has been shown to possess abortifa- cient (abortion-causing) activities in rodents, so it should be avoided during early pregnancy. Calendula may contain a very small measure of salicylic acid, a Calendula officinalis Herbs for Pets 72 constituent that is potentially toxic to cats. Although this compound is likely confined to the leaves and stems of the plant and does not occur in quantities that are likely to be of immediate danger to cats, its presence should be taken into account prior to long-term internal use. CATNIP Nepeta cataria Mint Family Appearance: Wild catnip is always a wonderful discovery. Its pungent tangy- mint aroma wafts to the nose with the slightest disturbance of the plant. And the flavor and soothing effects of the tea are likely to please even the most discriminating palate. Characteristically a mint, catnip has square stems and oppo- site leaves. Leaves are petiolate (stemmed), coarsely but often bluntly toothed, and nearly heart shaped to broadly lance shaped. Once one has become familiar with this plant, the aroma is a sure giveaway. The entire plant is distinctively fuzzy with an almost flannel-like texture. Unlike most other mints, which bloom in whorls at the upper leaf axils or in terminate clusters or spires, catnip blooms at both the upper leaf axils and in spikelike terminate clusters. Habitat and Range: Catnip is a Eurasian import that is now widespread in North America. It likes full sun and rich, moist soil, and is most frequently found in disturbed areas such as along irrigation channels and at the edges of cultivated fields. Unfortunately, this char- acteristic often makes it difficult for the herbalist or wild food forager to find uncontaminated plants. Fortunately, cat- nip can be found at many nurseries. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from late spring to midsummer Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers are collected before seeds begin to develop. Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, sedative, antispasmodic, helps alleviate vomiting (antiemetic), feline-euphoric, diuretic Strongest Affinities: Digestive and nervous systems Preparation: Fresh or dried chopped herb, water infusion, tincture, or, of course, stuffed in a catnip toy Common Uses: Catnip is a gentle gas reliever and antispasmodic for easing flatulence and stomach upsets. It also acts as a mild sedative to help calm the nerves and promote restful sleep in most animals. Due to an ingredient called nepetalactone, cats become intoxicated Nepeta cataria C Materia Medica 73 c when they sniff this plant. The effect of the herb when ingested is relaxing in a different way, calming to the stomach and relaxing to the nerves but without feline-erotic visions of candy-coated mice. Interestingly, about 20 percent of our feline friends do not experience a euphoric response to catnip. This is an excellent herb to consider for a high- strung animal with a nervous stomach, especially if episodes of vomiting are pre- cipitated by stressful events such as run- ning the vacuum cleaner, having the neighbors and their screaming child over for dinner, or—worse yet—bringing another kitten into the “royal palace.” You can administer 12–20 drops (0.25 to 0.5 milliliter) of a glycerin-based catnip tincture for every 20 pounds of an ani- mal’s body weight, ten to twenty min- utes prior to being subjected to stressful circumstances. For travel or other pro- longed periods of stress, the tincture can be added to the animal’s drinking water—12 drops per 8 ounces of water is a good starting dose. If the animal does not respond, try adding 6 drops at a time, until the desired calming effect is evident. Dropping a few fresh leaves into the animal’s drinking water may work as well. You can also try feeding dried cat- nip to your pet by putting it onto her food at a dose of 1⁄8 to 1⁄2 teaspoon per pound of food fed. Just remember that this might make kitty roll around in her dinner! Availability: Catnip has become a roadside weed in many areas. If you are not so fortunate, the plants or seeds are available through many nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Gather the leaves, stems, and flowers before the plant goes to seed. The herb can then be dried indoors. Spread the herb loosely on a clean sheet of paper, rearranging it frequently to prevent mold. The herb is ready for storage when it is crispy dry. Alternatives and Adjuncts: To help settle an upset stomach and to prevent nervous vomiting, catnip combines well with fennel. Chamomile serves as an effective adjunct or alternative in these circumstances. For motion sickness, a pinch of ginger can be added to a tea- spoon of dried, powdered catnip. The combination can then be given to a dog or cat in a small gel capsule. One capsule should do for a cat; a dog may require two or three, depending on her size. Cautions and Comments: The herb is safe, but use it sparingly in pregnant ani- mals, as it has been theorized that the volatile oils it contains may be passed on to the fetus, the result of which is unknown. CAYENNE Capsicum spp. Nightshade Family Appearance: Like many common names, the words capsicum and cayenne are used as generic terms for a broad range of small, very hot chili peppers. Most of these peppers are genetically engineered variations of two species of the Capsicum genus: C. frutescens and C. annuum. There are dozens of varieties, but they all share a similar appearance: shiny oval to lance-shaped, 1- to 5-inch- long leaves; small, white, star-shaped flowers; and sturdy, sometimes vinelike stems that reach anywhere from 1 to 3 feet tall when mature. Habitat and Range: Originally a native of tropical regions of South and Central America, virtually all of the capsicums are now cultivated in areas throughout the world with long growing seasons. In Herbs for Pets 74 northern climes, capsicum can be grown as an attractive houseplant. Cycle and Bloom Season: Wild South American capsicums are perennial plants that can reach 7 feet in height, but in North America most capsicums are culti- vated as annuals. Most capsicums bloom in early summer and produce ripe fruit by mid-August. Parts Used: Fruits Primary Medicinal Activities: Warms and reddens the skin (rubefacient), dilates blood vessels (vasodilator), stops bleeding (hemostatic), counterirritant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, strength- ens tissues (tonic) Strongest Affinities: Skin and circula- tory system Preparation: For internal uses, the dried and powdered fruits are most com- monly contained in gel capsules. The whole or powdered fruits may be used in oil infusions, salves, ointments, or tinc- tures. Various brands of capsaicin creams and ointments are commercially avail- able at drugstores for topical treatment of arthritis, muscle aches, stiffness, and other conditions. Common Uses: Capsicum is reliable in its activity as a peripheral vasodilator. Used internally, it acts to warm the body by quickly dilating small capillaries and increasing circulation to the skin and extremities. (This is why sweating and flushed skin is experienced when we eat foods containing cayenne.) Because of this activity, capsicum is commonly used in the systemic treatment of impaired blood circulation, and because it triggers the outward movement of blood throughout the body, it is often added as a “carrier” for the active components of other herbs. Its effect in this capacity can be quite dramatic, especially when it is combined with herbs that have an affin- ity toward the skin or extremities. By itself, capsicum is useful for opening cap- illary occlusions that are the by-product of a crushing injury, and it is considered a specific remedy for chronically defi- cient peripheral circulation—situations characterized by continuously cold paws, hands, or feet. Capsicum is also regarded as a circulatory stimulant for the lungs and may be useful for improv- ing pulmonary efficiency in animals with hypostatic pneumonia (a condition aris- ing from poor blood circulation through vascular structures of the lungs) or other conditions where edema or other factors are interfering with proper blood circula- tion in pulmonary tissues. In most internal applications, cap- sicum is administered once per day in the form of a gel capsule. For a dog or a cat, the capsule would contain a small pinch of the powder. For horses and other large animals, several full large capsules may be needed to bring about desired results. Finding the correct dose is contingent upon the specifics of the individual animal and the situation at hand. Topically, capsicum works as a contact rubefacient, serving to quickly open subcu- taneous capillaries while acting as a nerve block and reducing pain at the site of appli- cation. These topical attributes make cap- sicum especially useful for therapies that are to be confined to a specific portion of the body, such as those for stiff or arthritic knees that may benefit from the herb’s instantaneous warming effect. The com- pound chiefly responsible for this activity is called capsaicin, and in addition to its capacity to block pain and increase circula- tion, capsaicin has been shown to activate the body’s own anti-inflammatory media- tors at the site where it is applied. It not C Materia Medica 75 c only helps to reduce pain and congestion in arthritic joints but also acts as an assis- tant to the body’s internal anti-inflammato- ry mechanisms. These combined actions make topical preparations of capsicum use- ful for safely relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. On the top of our list of uses for cap- sicum, though, is its effectiveness at stopping bleeding. It’s interesting to note that while capsicum has such a pro- found ability to increase blood circula- tion when taken internally or applied onto the skin, its effects are quite oppo- site when applied to the site of internal or external bleeding. To stop the bleed- ing of a barbed wire cut, a claw that was clipped too short, or any other minor to moderate wound where profuse bleed- ing does not coagulate readily on its own, capsicum powder, or ground cayenne from the kitchen cabinet, can be liberally applied directly to the site of injury. Unless bleeding is emanating from a fairly large vessel, the result is like- ly to be instantaneous, and believe it or not, capsicum really doesn’t hurt much when applied to an open wound. Availability: Readily available wherever culinary spices are sold. Capsicum plants are available through virtually any nurs- ery that stocks vegetable plants. Propagation and Harvest: Capsicum is often slow to start from seed, so it is best to purchase young plants. Like most peppers, capsicums that are planted out- doors require warm, sunny days and nighttime temperatures that seldom fall below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (F) in order to produce fruit. Many varieties are quite suitable as houseplants. Alternatives and Adjuncts: To stop bleeding, capsicum combines well with yarrow. For circulatory problems, hawthorn, ginkgo, ginger, and yarrow should all be considered as well. Cautions and Comments: Contrary to what may seem obvious, capsicum does not cause irritation to the digestive tract when consumed in moderate quantities, but the key word here is moderate. You should not feed capsicum to animals who have a sensitive digestive tract or inflammatory digestive or urinary system disease unless you have a full under- standing of all underlying conditions. When used properly and in moderation, capsicum is a safe herb, but extra care and attention are needed to assure that capsicum is truly indicated. No two ani- mals are identical, and where capsicum may serve to benefit one, it can cause painful irritation to another. In other words, it is best to have your animal examined by a holistic veterinarian before proceeding with any internal Capsicum sp. Herbs for Pets 76 therapy that includes capsicum. Cap- sicum is a strong irritant to mucous membranes and should always be kept away from the eyes and nose. This is the stuff that bear-defense pepper spray is made from. Its topical use should be avoided with animals who have hyper- sensitive skin. Although capsicum is gen- erally considered safe during pregnancy, we recommend that its use be limited to topical applications. In our opinion, strong urinary tract irritants should not be used in pregnant or lactating animals. Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water after handling any form of this herb, and don’t touch your eyes, lips, or any other mucous membranes for about thirty minutes after. CHAMOMILE Matricaria recutita Sunflower Family Appearance: German chamomile is characterized by its 1⁄2- to 1-inch flowers, each with a yellow disk surrounded by ten to twenty white rays (petals). The com- mon name chamomile is used in reference to dozens of related species, but most of the medicinal uses are isolated to two genera, M. recutita (German chamomile) and Chamaemelum nobile (Roman chamomile), and their respective sub- species. The differences between these two groups of chamomile rest in their life cycles, the number of flowers they pro- duce, and their overall size. German chamomile is an annual plant that can grow to 2 feet tall, producing numerous flowers on each of its many stems. Roman chamomile, on the other hand, is a creep- ing perennial that seldom exceeds 1 foot in height and produces fewer but larger (1-inch-wide) flowers. Both German and Roman chamomiles share a nearly identi- cal range of therapeutic usefulness, but German chamomile is by far the more popular medicine because it has received much more research attention and has long been regarded by herbalists as a more potent medicine than Roman chamomile. For the purposes of this book, our primary focus is on German chamomile; there is, however, a generally overlooked wild relative of cultivated vari- eties of chamomile that also deserves a place in the animal herbalist’s repertory: pineapple weed (M. matricarioides). Pineapple weed looks, smells, and even tastes much like its cultivated cousins, but its flowers have no petals. This small way- side weed is often found growing in incon- spicuous ground-hugging mats in vacant lots, on road margins, and sometimes right in the middle of a driveway! Habitat and Range: A Native of Europe and western Asia, chamomile is cultivated worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: Chamomile is notorious for its continuous bloom. In areas where the occurrence of frost is rare, chamomile often produces flowers throughout the year. Parts Used: Flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- spasmodic, expels intestinal gas, anti- inflammatory, sedative, antimicrobial, stimulates digestion (bitter), heals wounds, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Skin, digestive tract, liver, nervous system, mucous membranes, smooth-muscle tissues Preparation: Water or oil infusion, tinc- ture, salve, ointment, fomentation Common Uses: Chamomile is a mild sedative, antispasmodic, and digestive tonic that is safe, gentle, and effective in C Materia Medica 77 c a broad spectrum of applications. The herb tea or tincture is helpful for indiges- tion, gas, and vomiting. Chamomile is perhaps the first herb to reach for in cases of digestive upset that arises from nervousness and hyperexcitability. The chemistry of chamomile is complex, and its medicinal activities are not attributa- ble to any single class of constituents but rather to a synergistic sum of all its parts. However, dozens of scientific studies (using both animals and humans) have given us solid information about which of chamomile’s chemical compounds contribute to its effectiveness as a holis- tic healing device. For example, ape- genin, chamazulene (and its precursor, matricin) and other volatile oil con- stituents of the flowers have been shown to be strong antispasmodic agents both in and on the body, as have several of chamomile’s flavonoid constituents. In the digestive tract, chamomile serves to ease nervous spasms, helps to expel gas, aids in the production of bile to improve digestion, and reduces inflammation. All of these activities amount to an excellent remedy for chronic or acute gastric dis- orders, including various forms of inflam- matory bowel disease. For inflammations of the skin, including those caused by fleabites, contact allergies, and various bacterial or fungal infections, a cooled water infusion of the flowers can be used as a soothing, healing, antimicrobial rinse. For conjunctivitis, whether it be from bacterial infection or the result of air- borne irritants or allergies, the cooled infusion can be carefully strained through a paper coffee filter, diluted with saline solution (the end product should be transparent and light yellow), and used as an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial eyewash that can be applied liberally several times per day until the inflammation subsides. Chamomile has also been shown to have a tonic (constricting and strength- ening) effect on smooth-muscle tissues throughout the body, including the heart, bladder, and especially the uterus. While uterine tonics may be beneficial before pregnancy and during late-term pregnancy, herbs that constrict uterine tissues are generally contraindicated dur- ing early pregnancy. In our experiences chamomile serves as a general-purpose calming herb that can be fed to animals as a “first try” rem- edy for any variety of spasmodic or anx- iety-related problems. Because it tastes good, is soluble in water, and is safe for most animals, its use should be consid- ered before stronger, less-palatable anti- spasmodics or sedatives are employed. Chamomile’s usefulness in expelling worms is often overlooked in favor of faster acting herbs (such as wormwood, black walnut hulls, or garlic), but it Matricaria recutita Herbs for Pets 78 should not be. Chamomile is relatively nontoxic when compared to most other “herbal wormers.” While it doesn’t work as quickly as the other anthelmintics, it does work, especially for roundworms and whipworms, and it offers anti- inflammatory activities that help coun- teract the effect parasites often have on intestinal mucosa. Pineapple weed (M. matricarioides) is even more pronounced in its worm-expelling activities. For internal uses, we prefer a glyc- erin tincture of the herb because it can be administered in small, easy-to-feed doses of 0.25–0.50 milliliter per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily as needed to suppress symptoms. The sweet-tasting glycerin tincture can be administered directly into the animal’s mouth, or it can be added to the animal’s drinking water. The glycerite is also useful in treating gingivitis, especially when small pro- portions of stronger antimicrobial herb extracts (such as thyme, rosemary, bee balm, Oregon grape, or echinacea) are added. To use chamomile in this capacity, the tincture can be applied directly to the gums of the animal with a cotton swab. Chamomile extract can also be used in a vaporizer or steamed from boiling water for inhalation treatment of asth- ma, allergies, bronchitis, and the like. In homeopathic form, chamomile is used for teething puppies to keep them from chewing everything in sight. Availability: Chamomile can be pur- chased from any health food retailer and is available at most supermarkets. The plants are available through most nurs- eries, as are the seeds. Propagation and Harvest: Chamomile is easy to grow in all climates, and once established its promiscuous, free-seeding character yields abundant growth year after year. If left to its unruly self, it is like- ly to find its way out of flower beds and into pathways and beyond. Chamomile blooms continuously throughout the growing season. The flow- ers can be plucked off at any time and dried indoors on a piece of clean paper or a nonmetallic screen. Fresh flowers are useful, too, and in fact are a stronger option for use in skin rinses and against intestinal parasites, but the dried flowers have a much more pleasant flavor. Alternatives and Adjuncts: In cases of nervous stomach problems and gas, look to catnip, fennel, and bee balm. Chamomile combines well with calendu- la, juniper leaves, or uva ursi in anti- inflammatory skin rinses. For irritable bowel, diarrhea, and other gastric disor- ders, consider plantain, slippery elm, and marshmallow. For inflammatory urinary tract problems, chamomile combines with corn silk, plantain, uva ursi, white oak bark, couch grass, and marshmal- low. For use against worms, chamomile can be combined at a 4:1 ratio (four parts chamomile to one part other herb) with garlic, Oregon grape, organically raised goldenseal, wormwood, or black walnut hulls. Cautions and Comments: Chamomile is, without doubt, one of the safest herbs in existence, but some animals (and humans too) are extremely allergic to this plant and its relatives. Always check for sensitivity before feeding this herb by applying a small amount of the prepara- tion to an animal’s skin. Then if no reac- tions are observed, feed just a drop or two and watch for any changes in your animal. Studies suggest that excessive use of chamomile during pregnancy may increase fetus reabsorption and inhibit fetus growth in some animals. C Materia Medica 79 c CHAPARRAL Larrea tridentata Caltrop Family Appearance: Chaparral (also common- ly known as creosote bush) is the pre- dominant low-desert shrub of the U.S. Southwest. The abundance of this shrub almost makes a description of it unneces- sary, as many who live or travel between the Pacific Ocean and inland states of the Southwest invariably find themselves within what seems to be an endless expanse of these ancient plants. But, for those who are unfamiliar with the plant, chaparral is the chest-high to 10-feet-tall dark green bush with spindly wind- whipped branches, which contributes to the highway hypnosis we all suffer while driving to and from Las Vegas. The leaves are tiny (1⁄8 inch long) and have a greasy- leathery texture. The bark is reddish brown toward the base of the plant and progressively lighter (to almost white) on the smaller limbs. Flowers are minute and yellow, developing into oddly fuzzy seed-bearing capsules. Chaparral is one of the oldest living inhabitants of our planet, with some individual plants esti- mated to be over ten thousand years old! Habitat and Range: Profusely abun- dant from the deserts of central Texas westward through the southern half of New Mexico and Arizona to the deserts of southern California and Nevada. Cycle and Bloom Season: Chaparral often blooms according to precipitation. Generally, this occurs any time from March through May. Parts Used: Leaves, flowers, fruits Primary Medicinal Activities: Inhibits bacterial reproduction (bacteriostatic), antifungal, kills certain types of amoeba (amoebicidal), antioxidant, helps with blood cleansing Strongest Affinities: Skin, blood, liver Preparation: A decoction is used exter- nally as a skin and coat rinse or as an ingredient in salves and ointments. For small animals, the fomentation method of application is strongly advised (see chapter 1) because this form of prepara- tion allows the active constituents of the herb to remain on the body longer and prohibits the animal from licking off the decoction. Salves or ointments that con- tain a large percentage of chaparral should also be kept out of the mouth of the animal. For horses or other large ani- mals, this is less of an issue, especially if the decoction is applied to portions of the body that are beyond reach of the animal’s mouth. Larrea tridentata Herbs for Pets 80 Because this plant is naturally designed to resist harsh desert elements, it is poorly soluble in water. Therefore, decoctions and alcohol-based tinctures are the best methods of extraction for this plant. Common Uses: American Indians of the Southwest have used this plant for centuries—for everything from the internal treatment of tumors and hepatic (liver) diseases to topical skin treatments, including sunscreen, for themselves and their animals. Today, herbalists use the plant as a strong bacteriostatic and antioxidant agent in the treatment of blood and liver disorders. However, recent scientific research and documented incidents have raised both hope and concern. Some studies have shown that chemical constituents in chaparral may inhibit the growth of cancerous cells, while others have shown exactly the opposite. And recently, a few accounts of serious liver damage (in humans) have been attributed to this herb. Many theories as to why this plant may suddenly be harming us after hundreds of years of safe medicinal use. One the- ory is that perhaps humanity and chaparral are evolving away from one another. Nevertheless, thousands of people still use chaparral on a daily basis, and it remains a popular herbal medicine in natural products markets worldwide. In animals, chaparral has been shown to have strong antifungal, antibacterial, and, remarkably, amoebicidal proper- ties. The constituent believed to be responsible for most of chaparral’s medicinal activity is a lignan compound known as nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Nordihydroguaiaretic acid may be effective in treating various forms of amebiasis, including Entamoeba histolyt- ica, an amoeba that can be passed from humans to the digestive tracts of dogs (but rarely to other animals) and causes acute or chronic colitis characterized by persistent diarrhea. It has also been proven effective against Salmonella, Streptococcus, Phylococcus aureus, Baci- llus subtilis, and various other pathogens and molds. Unfortunately, chaparral’s toxicity prohibits it from most internal uses. But its remarkable antimicrobial properties make it an excellent broad- spectrum topical agent that is as useful for the animal handler as it is for the ani- mal receiving care. Used as a hand rinse before and after handling animals who may be carrying Salmonella or other transmittable pathogens or as a rinse applied prior to handling animals who are prone to infec- tion from human-carried pathogens, a decoction of chaparral serves an effective two-way adjunct to soap and water. For external treatment of fungal infections of the hooves, nails, or skins of various large and small animals, chaparral is among the first herbs to try. Just remember, keep chaparral from going into the ani- mal’s digestive tract. Availability: Available through herb retailers; profusely available in the low desert regions of the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. Propagation and Harvest: In arid regions, chaparral can be transplanted into the garden as a slow-growing land- scape shrub. The leaves, twigs, and flow- ers can be harvested any time. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For anti- bacterial skin rinses, bee balm, chamomile, sage, thyme, or rosemary can be used. For treatment of psoriasis and other inflamma- tory skin disorders, chaparral combines well with calendula or aloe. C Materia Medica 81 c Cautions and Comments: Ingestion of any form of this plant in large enough quantities may lead to liver damage. For this reason, it is a good idea to take extra measures to assure that your animal does not lick off external applications of chap- arral after they are applied. Therefore, we recommend that you wrap dogs, cats, and other small animals in a towel after a skin rinse has been applied. CHICKWEED Stellaria media Pink Family Appearance: Common chickweed is a weak-stemmed sprawling annual that is commonly found in lush, low-growing mats or entangled in other growth (oftentimes in rose beds). Chickweed exhibits a unique characteristic that makes it easy to differentiate from all look-alikes: a line of minute hairs runs up only one side of the stem; switching sides at each pair of leaves. Opposite leaves may grow to 11⁄2 inches and range in shape from broadly lance shaped to oval but always have distinct points at their tips. Flowers are small (1⁄4 inch across) and white with five petals that are clefted at their tips to give the false appearance of ten petals. Chickweed blooms continuously, each time drop- ping its seeds as it continues its sprawl. Habitat and Range: Chickweed inhab- its moist meadows, ravines, and dis- turbed areas throughout all of North America, from the Brooks Range of Alaska to all points southward. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms and free-seeds itself contin- uously throughout growth Parts Used: Freshly harvested leaves, flowers, and stems Primary Medicinal Activities: Sooth- ing to the skin; lubricates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes (demulcent), diuretic, tonic Strongest Affinities: Skin and diges- tive tract Preparation: Fresh whole plant, fresh juice of the plant, water or oil infusion, salves, ointments. If you have access to a juicer, try this: Juice enough of the fresh plants to fill an ice-cube tray (preferably a stainless steel one), then freeze it. If the tray is stored in a resealable bag and kept in a freezer, the frozen juice cubes keeps for about three months. Individual cubes can be thawed and the juice used as needed, internally or externally. Common Uses: Whether for human or animal purposes, chickweed is a safe, deli- cious resource for providing soothing, Stellaria media Herbs for Pets 82 cooling relief for virtually any form of minor irritation. Internally, chickweed acts to soothe, protect, and mildly lubricate the upper digestive tract. Fed in its entire fresh form, it is useful for relieving minor esophageal irritations, such as those caused by something Rover ate that had rough edges, or even a minor bite or sting that Godzilla the iguana suffered from snapping at an insect with bad manners. Chickweed can also be fed to dogs or cats as a source of lubrication and light roughage that may assist in the expulsion of hair balls. For mild cases of stomach upset that are believed to be the result of an irritated stomach lining or for a mild case of colitis, fresh chickweed or chick- weed juice is indicated as a mild first aid tonic for dogs, cats, and horses or any other herbivore. If chickweed is not astrin- gent or mucilaginous enough to bring relief, the therapy can be progressively “upgraded” by using stronger herbs. Chickweed is nutritious and an excellent nutritive and digestive tonic for birds. Chickweed poultices are useful for cooling and soothing minor burns and skin irrita- tions, particularly when associated with itching and dryness. Availability: Chickweed grows just about everywhere in the world. If you cannot find a wild source, many special- ty seed catalogs now carry the seed. Don’t bother with the dried herb you are likely to find in the marketplace—it just isn’t the same! Propagation and Harvest: Because chickweed is a vigorous free-seeder, transplanting it into the garden is as easy as grabbing a handful of the plants and spreading them on a moist flower bed. Give your chickweed plenty of water, rich soil, and at least four hours of shade each day, and it will likely be at your service forever. Although this plant likes to sprawl, its delicate (and delicious) nature seldom poses a problem to the weed-weary gardener. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Aloe juice or gel is a better option for burns and irritations of the skin. In salves and oint- ments, chickweed combines nicely with calendula or Saint-John’s-wort. For cases of gastrointestinal irritation that will not respond to chickweed’s gentle nature, slippery elm, plantain, or marshmallow should be considered. Cautions and Comments: Generally, chickweed is considered to be a safe medicinal food plant—it can be fed to most animals in whatever quantities they desire. Large quantities of chickweed, however, can have a laxative effect. Always keep in mind that some animals may be allergic to chickweed. Perhaps the most important thing to consider with the use of this plant is that it often lives among hated weeds that have been subjected to herbicides, and it is fre- quently found in waste areas that are subject to various contaminants. CLEAVERS Galium aparine Madder Family Appearance: The Galium genus is large and widespread, with no fewer than thirteen species in the Pacific Northwest alone. Species can be divid- ed into two general groups: perennial and annual. In essence, the annual vari- eties are sprawlers and climbers, often forming ground-covering mats with much weaker taproots and more deli- cate stems and leaves than perennial species. All Galium plants have square stems and slender leaves that grow in whorled clusters like bicycle spokes of two to eight leaves, depending on the C Materia Medica 83 c species. Flowers are small and white to greenish in color. Galium aparine (see photo) is a widely distributed annual variety that has earned most of the attention of the herb market because of its delicate, aromatic, and readily water soluble nature. It has earned the com- mon names of “cleavers” and “tangle- weed” because of the thousands of infinitesimal, reversed hooks on the angles of its stems. These tiny hooks enable the plant to cling to just about anything in a fashion similar to the way static-charged hair clings to clothing. This allows cleavers to reproduce effec- tively because the delicate seed-bearing foliage is easily uprooted and carried away by passersby. Perennial varieties such as northern bedstraw (G. boreale) do not share this unique characteristic. Habitat and Range: Cleavers (G. aparine) and most other annual varieties prefer moist habitats and are commonly found growing in shaded ravines and along streams. Northern bedstraw (G. boreale) and other perennial species can tolerate a much wider diversity of habi- tats and are commonly found along road margins and in dry, sunny areas. Both cleavers and northern bedstraw are com- mon throughout North America and most of the Northern Hemisphere, up to about 6,000 feet in elevation. Cycle and Bloom Season: Annual or perennial (depending on species). Most Galium spp. bloom in early to midsummer. Parts Used: Entire fresh plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Tonic, helps with blood cleansing, diuretic, astrin- gent, anti-inflammatory, heals wounds Strongest Affinities: Lymph system, urinary tract, skin Preparation: Juice, tincture, or tea of the fresh plant Common Uses: Herbalists have long regarded cleavers as a valuable lymphat- ic tonic. In essence, the lymph system is responsible for “washing” body tissues. Throughout the body, lymph is passed across capillary barriers to remove waste materials from healthy cell communities. The lymph is then returned to the blood- stream, where in a properly functioning body it is cleaned of waste material by the liver and kidneys. The waste then (hopefully) leaves the body via the usual urinary and digestive outlets. Cleavers is used in virtually any condi- tion that is characterized by general or localized swelling or in situations where lymphatic circulation has been impaired by the formation of scar tissue, ulceration, or infection. Although the activities of cleavers are subtle, the herb is believed to Galium aparine Herbs for Pets 84 increase circulation of lymph in impaired areas of the body through dilation of small, almost cellular-level capillaries. This would explain the remarkable ability of cleavers in helping speed the healing of gastric ulcers and the herb’s long-standing reputation for aiding drainage of lymph- engorged cysts, tumors, and inflamed tis- sues of the urinary tract. In addition to its lymphatic qualities, cleavers lends mild astringent activities to its job of relieving inflammations of the upper digestive and urinary tracts. In cats, these activities make cleavers a safe long-term aid in the treat- ment of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD), also known as feline urinary syn- drome (FUS), and the herb may also be useful for chronic low-grade kidney inflammation. Because cleavers is thought to increase lymphatic flow throughout body tissues, it may be useful as an alterative therapy in the treatment of various skin disorders. From a holistic perspective, skin problems such as psoriasis and eczema are usually the result of poor elimination of systemic waste. Instead of being “washed” out by the lymph system, “filtered” by the liver and kidneys, and eliminated from the body, the waste materials build up in the body, resulting in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and conditions such as flaky, oily, or itchy skin. By improving lymphatic circulation, a critical level of sys- temic waste management is assisted. Although relatively little scientific research has been done to validate these claims, its long history of use and safe track record make cleavers a worthwhile tonic for those who are willing to accept natural healing based on anecdotal evidence. A typical starting dose of the glycerin tincture for dogs, cats, birds, and other animals is 0.5–1.0 milliliter per 50 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. Horses, rab- bits, and other herbivores can be fed the fresh herb in their daily meals. Availability: Cleavers is a common wild plant throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. It is available in various forms at local herb retailers, but remember that the dried herb (or any preparation of the dried herb) is inferior medicine compared to the fresh plant. If you plan to purchase a commercial preparation of cleavers, check the label to make sure that it was produced from the fresh plant—otherwise, you might be buying an expensive but powerless herb. Fresh plant tinctures, in our opin- ion, is the best choice. Propagation and Harvest: A few specialty seed catalogs offer cleavers (G. aparine) seed, and many nurseries sell starts of “sweet woodruff,” a generic term for any variety of perennial Galium spp. sold as bedding plants. While these cultivars likely possess medicinal attrib- utes, exactly how they measure up to the “herbalist-approved” G. aparine is unknown. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For prob- lems involving the lymphatic system, cleavers combines with calendula, echi- nacea, or astragalus. For skin and liver problems, cleavers is best if combined with alterative, diuretic, and liver- strengthening and stimulating herbs— dandelion, burdock, Oregon grape, milk thistle, and yellow dock should be con- sidered. For treatment of tumors, cleavers is traditionally combined with red clover, licorice, violet, or aloe. For urinary tract problems, check out corn silk, marshmallow, and couch grass as alternatives or adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Cleavers is a safe herb. No contraindications have been noted with animal or human use, although allergic reaction is a possibility to consider before feeding. C Materia Medica 85 c COLTSFOOT Petasites and Sunflower Family Tussilago species Appearance: The common name of coltsfoot is shared by two distinctly dif- ferent genera, Tussilago and Petasites. The classic Old World coltsfoot is T. far- fara, a European native that produces light yellow, dandelion-like flowers and leaves proportionately large and heart shaped. The Petasites genus, on the other hand, produces its flowers on a leafless stem before the leaves fully develop. Five species of Petasites inhabit North America, while T. farfara is strictly a naturalized import here. Both genera of coltsfoot are equally valuable as medi- cines. For the purposes of identifying varieties native to North America, we focus on the Petasites clan of coltsfoot. The flowers of Petasites are generally drab and featherlike, ranging in color from white to light purple, and are pre- sented in a cluster at the top of the plant. Leaves vary in shape according to species, from triangular (P. frigidus and P. nivalis) or narrowly arrow shaped (P. sag- itatta), to broadly oval shaped with deep palmate (resembling a hand with the fin- gers spread) lobes (P. palmatus). The 3- to 10-inch-wide leaves are presented on long leaf stems that extend directly from thick, creeping rootstocks and are dark green on their upper surfaces and lighter green and feltlike on their undersides. Habitat and Range: Coltsfoot requires consistent moisture at its feet and is usu- ally found along streams, in wet mead- ows, and on shaded road margins, par- ticularly where water seepage is contin- uous. Several species of Petasites range in forested areas from Alaska southward to California and eastward across the northern half of North America. The European variety of coltsfoot (T. farfara) has escaped cultivation in the northeast- ern portions of the U.S., where it enjoys similar habitat characteristics. Cycle and Bloom Season: Late March to early June Parts Used: Leaves and stems of the mature plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Expect- orant, eases cough spasms (antispasmod- ic), anti-inflammatory, antibacterial Strongest Affinities: Lungs and upper respiratory tract Preparation: Water infusion (tea), tinc- ture, or syrup Common Uses: People have been using coltsfoot for hundreds of years in the Petasites palmatus Herbs for Pets 86 treatment of respiratory ailments rang- ing from chest colds to whooping cough, asthma, and viral pneumonia. Coltsfoot has long been regarded as a first choice for relieving the rawness and pain of unproductive spasmodic coughs. It is soothing because of its mucilage, and the ingredient petasin acts as an antispasmodic and nerve sedative for the bronchial rings and pulmonary receptors in the lungs. Coltsfoot is useful in easing the dis- comforts of respiratory infections that are characterized by dry cough or seem- ingly immobile accumulations of thick phlegm in the bronchi. We find it partic- ularly useful for tracheobronchitis in dogs (specifically kennel cough), espe- cially when combined with anti-viral herbs such as licorice. Preparations of T. farfara have been shown to inhibit Bordetella pertussis, a bacterial compo- nent of the kennel cough malady, as well as various other strains of gram-negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus hauseri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris. All of this makes coltsfoot useful as a respiratory disinfec- tant, expectorant, and cough suppres- sant in a wide variety of different ani- mals—plus it acts in a holistic manner. Many forms of cough suppressants (including wild cherry bark) simply sup- press the body’s efforts to heal itself by acting upon the brain to block the body’s cough response mechanisms. Coltsfoot, on the other hand, gently assists the body in its efforts to clear invading microbes out of the upper res- piratory tract. Glycerin tinctures are the ideal form of administration of this herb. A good starting dosage for most ani- mals is 0.5–1.5 milliliters (or about 1⁄3 teaspoon) per 20 pounds of an ani- mal’s body weight, two to three times a day. Availability: Although coltsfoot is cur- rently under FDA scrutiny and will likely be labeled as “unsafe for internal use,” the tincture or dried herb remains wide- ly available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Coltsfoot (both Tussilago and Petasites) can be propagated in a garden if given ample shade and rich, consistently moist, slightly acidic soil. This winter-hardy plant does best in a cool climate. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For deep coughs and bronchial congestion, colts- foot may be combined with mullein, horehound, licorice, or elecampane. For respiratory infections that are believed to be bacterial or fungal in origin, coltsfoot can be boosted with echinacea, Oregon grape, bee balm, or thyme. For respira- tory viruses, licorice and echinacea are good adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Coltsfoot contains PAs. The PA content of coltsfoot is about one-third of that contained in com- frey (Symphytum spp.), and most of this compound is contained in the plant’s flowers, not the leaves and stems. What this means is that the PA content of colts- foot is really quite low. Nevertheless, it can cause harm if it is used in absence of com- mon sense. For more on pyrrolizidine alka- loids (PAs), see “Comfrey.” COMFREY Symphytum officinale Borage Family Appearance: Comfrey is a robust plant with coarsely textured, broadly lance- shaped leaves that may exceed a foot in length at the base of the plant and become progressively smaller toward the top of the plant. The leaves and hollow stalk of the plant are covered with bristly C Materia Medica 87 c hairs that tend to irritate human skin. The downy tubular flowers are presented among the small upper leaves in droop- ing clusters and are usually a shade of pink or purple but are sometimes white or pale yellow. Large plants may reach 3 or more feet in height and multiply vig- orously by continuous root division, sometimes forming their own sort of hedgelike clump. Symphytum upland- icum (Russian comfrey) may grow in excess of 6 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Over thirty-five species of Symphytum are in cultivation worldwide, most having originated from Europe and western Asia. In North America, common comfrey (S. officinale) and Russian comfrey (S. uplandicum) are the most common garden varieties. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from early spring to late fall Parts Used: All aboveground parts Primary Medicinal Activities: Heals wounds; anti-inflammatory; astringent; lubricates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; expectorant Strongest Affinities: Skin, digestive tract, respiratory tract Preparation: Water or oil infusion, poultice, salve, fomentation Common Uses: Where does one start with an herb that has had such a rich his- tory as a healing device? Comfrey tradi- tionally has been used for everything from mastitis in goats to cancer in humans. Virtual libraries of scientific research and anecdotal records have been compiled over the centuries to substantiate, deny, or otherwise argue comfrey’s value and safety as an herbal medicine. Most of what you may have heard about this plant extends to ani- mals (especially mammals), including toxicity issues, and almost everyone who has lived around horses, goats, sheep, llamas, and a comfrey patch knows how valuable this plant is. Comfrey is among the first herbs to consider in the topical treatment of burns, skin ulcerations, abrasions, lacera- tions, flea and other insect bites, or just about any other irritation. Likewise, a poultice, salve, or infusion of the leaves can be applied directly to bruises, frac- tures, sprains, and other closed-tissue injuries. Most of the healing effects are attributable to allantoin, a compound that has been shown in several studies to speed cell reproduction, both inside and outside of the body. In fact, many herbalists have found that comfrey works so well at speed-healing injuries that it Symphytum officinale Herbs for Pets 88 can actually seal bacteria into the site of an open wound. To prevent this from happening, a strong antibacterial herb such as Oregon grape, thyme, usnea, or Saint-John’s-wort should be added to any comfrey preparation that is intended for open wounds, especially burns. In addition to its cell-proliferation activity, comfrey’s mucilaginous nature provides a soothing, lubricating, and protective barrier to the skin and inflammations of the digestive tract. Comfrey also con- tains rosmarinic acid and several other compounds that have been shown to contribute anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and astringent qualities to its list of heal- ing attributes. For external treatment of closed injuries, skin ulcers, or mastitis, you can make a poultice or fomentation from the fresh or dried leaves and apply to the affected area. If you have access to fresh comfrey leaves, wrap a handful in a clean towel, then place the towel into a bowl of boiling water. Allow it to soak until the water just begins to turn green, then remove the towel and leaves and squeeze the excess water from the towel back into the bowl. After allowing the fomentation to cool slightly, apply the warm compress to the affected area. With horses and other large animals, this might require you to secure the com- press onto a swollen limb with a strip of gauze or a clean piece of fabric torn from some old clothing. Leave the compress on for as long as possible—preferably eight hours or more. The extra “comfrey tea” that you squeezed back into the bowl can be applied to the compress from time to time and allowed to soak through to where it is needed. In cases of mastitis or other ailments where a fixed compress is not practical, an ointment or salve is a better option. If neither of these preparations is available, try making a strong tea of the leaves (fresh leaves are always superior to dried) and rinsing the entire area with the lukewarm liquid sev- eral times per day. Internal use of comfrey has become a controversial issue and is strongly dis- couraged by the FDA, though millions of people have been using this herb safely and effectively in their animals (and themselves) for centuries. As is true for many other herbs, the safe use of com- frey is measured by moderation and common sense. For treatment of colitis, stomach ulcers, or just about any other inflamma- tion of the digestive tract, a handful of the fresh leaves or 2–3 ounces of the dried leaves can be fed directly to horses and other large herbivores on a daily basis for up to two weeks. For dogs and cats, 1⁄2–1 teaspoon of the dried herb for each pound of food fed should be of therapeutic benefit. Comfrey is traditionally used for bronchitis and other respiratory ail- ments that are relieved by its soothing anti-inflammatory nature. A cooled tea serves this purpose well. Administer 1 tablespoon per 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. In all cases of internal use, feeding of com- frey should be limited to occasional short-term therapies. By no means should comfrey be fed to an animal as a daily food supplement because the plant contains small cumulative amounts of potentially toxic PAs. For the same reason, highly concentrated preparations such as tinctures or strong decoctions should not be employed internally. Availability: Any nursery that carries herb plants has access to comfrey. The dried herb and various salves, ointments, and other preparations containing com- frey are available through health food retailers and herb stores. C Materia Medica 89 c Propagation and Harvest: Comfrey can be easily started from root cuttings. It grows in just about any soil and is hardy as far north as central Canada. The biggest plants, though, are found in rich, deep, moist soil with a pH level in the range of 6 to 7.5. Once established, comfrey needs little attention. In fact, its rambunctious growth will amaze you. We live in an area of Montana that has a scant one hundred-day growing season and winter temperatures that may plunge to –40°F, yet our comfrey (which grows from beneath the foundation of the house) can be divided into multiple new starts at least twice per year! Alternatives and Adjuncts: For exter- nal applications, comfrey combines espe- cially well with calendula, chamomile, aloe, Saint-John’s-wort, or bee balm. For gastric disorders, comfrey combines with cleavers, calendula, catnip, or chamomile. Cautions and Comments: The issues of toxicity that have haunted comfrey in recent years have become a major sub- ject of frustration for herbalists, a source of apprehension and political ammuni- tion for opponents of herbal medicine, and a wealth of misinformation, confu- sion, and fear for the casual herb user. While the FDA and other protective agencies are doing their jobs as best they can during a major health care revolu- tion—and it is not our intent to criticize them—most herbalists agree that com- frey has received an undeserved bad rep- utation. The FDA has banned the sale of comfrey for internal use, but in thou- sands of years of use by millions of peo- ple, only two reports of hepatotoxicity have been documented in humans. Indeed, comfrey contains PAs, which are known to cause liver damage or can- cer if ingested in large enough quanti- ties. Most of the concern surrounding these alkaloids, however, comes from studies or cases where the alkaloids were isolated from the rest of the plant’s chem- istry and then fed or injected into test ani- mals in quantities or concentrations hun- dreds of times greater than those that would occur in nature. Common sense dictates that anything ingested in over- abundance is potentially toxic, but given the fact that the PA content in a fresh comfrey leaf amounts to only about 0.3 percent of its total chemistry, the average horse would need to eat several hundred pounds of the leaves each day before any toxic effects would be observed! Coffee contains over one dozen potentially toxic alkaloids—so does chocolate. However, the real threat from PAs comes from the fact that these alkaloids may accumulate in the body, perhaps to toxic levels, if used continually over a long period. Therefore, if you plan to use comfrey or any other herb that contains PAs in an internal application, do so with modera- tion and only for short periods. Don’t use comfrey in pregnant or lactating animals or in animals with preexisting liver disease. Also, keep in mind that the PA content of the root is ten times greater than that of the fresh leaves; therefore, the root shouldn’t be used internally. On the other hand, the PA content of the dried leaves, the form in which comfrey is most readily available in the marketplace, is practically nil. CORN SILK Zea mays Grass Family Appearance: We’re sorry if you were expecting something other than the obvious here, but the corn silk we’re referring to is simply the hairlike pollen- receiving portion of a corn stalk, the part most of us throw away first when we peel an ear of corn. Herbs for Pets 90 Habitat and Range: Farms and gar- dens throughout the world Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms in early summer. The “silk” develops just as the plant is beginning to form cobs. Parts Used: Silk Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic; lubricates, soothes, and protects inter- nal mucous membranes; anti-inflamma- tory, stimulates the liver (cholagogue), astringent Strongest Affinities: Genitourinary tract, including the kidneys Preparation: A low-alcohol (less than 25 percent alcohol) tincture or an infu- sion (tea) of the fresh silk is preferable. The dried silk may be used if it is fresh, but it is not as potent as silk that has been recently pulled from the plant. Common Uses: First and foremost, corn silk is indicated wherever chronic inflammation exists in any portion of the urinary tract or kidneys. It is specifi- cally indicated in FLUTD, where it serves to reduce inflammation without caus- ing added irritation to the kidneys. Unlike many other diuretic and astrin- gent herbs used to increase urine out- put by means of kidney irritation, corn silk does not contain harsh volatile oils that may compound the problems of inflammatory kidney disease. Therefore, it is useful for improving kidney func- tion during early onset kidney failure or for helping with the reduction of pain and inflammation in the passing of kidney or bladder stones (especially when combined with marshmallow). The astringency factor of corn silk is enough to tighten and strengthen the lining of the bladder and the smooth- muscle tissues of the urinary tract, mak- ing the herb useful in some cases of chronic urinary incontinence, but it is not strong enough to effectively stop acute cases of bleeding or inflamma- tion. So, corn silk is best remembered as a long-term medicine for chronic uri- nary problems. Corn silk has been shown to lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels and to possess chola- gogue and diuretic activities in labora- tory animals. All of these activities serve as clues as to why corn silk is especially effective as a general kidney tonic. The effectiveness of fresh silk over dried cannot be overstated, and the best meth- ods of administration involve the direct feeding of the herb in a low-alcohol liquid base (a strong tea is ideal). Dosage is diffi- cult to generalize because of the variable nature of genitourinary diseases. But a safe starting point is to use 1 milliliter (about 30 drops or so, or 1⁄4 teaspoon) of the low- alcohol tincture per 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. If the tinc- ture is alcohol-free, it can be administered directly into the mouth. If not, it should be no more than 25 percent alcohol and should then be further diluted with at least an equal amount of water. To make a tea of the fresh silk, chop it as finely as possible, then steep a heaping tablespoon of the herb in near-boiling water until the mixture cools. After the tea is strained, it can be fed to the animal—1⁄4 cup (if possible) per 20 pounds of body weight, twice daily. Many herbivores enjoy eating corn silk. This is fine, but remember that if you want to get an optimum amount of the herb into your animal’s uri- nary tract, it really needs to be adminis- tered as a liquid. Availability: Finding dried corn silk is easy and several manufacturer’s pro- vide extracts of this herb, but if you C Materia Medica 91 c want fresh corn silk, you might have to plant some corn in your herb garden. If you have access to organically raised fresh corn at your local health food store, you can use the silk from this. However, nonorganic sources of corn silk should be avoided because the silk has likely been sprayed with a pesti- cide. Corn silk should look fresh, juicy, and colorful. If it has turned brown, much of its medicinal activity has diminished. Propagation and Harvest: Corn is easy to grow, and dozens of varieties are available to suit virtually any set of growing conditions. (We live at an ele- vation of 5,500 feet in Montana, and even we can grow corn.) Harvest your corn before the silk turns brown—usual- ly in early summer. If you want to eat the corn, make sure that it has an opportunity to receive pollen from the tassels of the plants for at least a week before you harvest, otherwise your cobs will have no kernels. Plan to use your fresh silk immediately. Cooled corn silk tea can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week—a glycerin tincture keeps for at least a year if kept refrigerated. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For chronic urinary tract inflammation, corn silk combines well with couch grass, calendula, or cleavers. If infec- tion is evident, add echinacea, Oregon grape, yarrow, or thyme. For urinary incontinence, read about Saint-John’s- wort, ginkgo, and uva ursi. To help pass kidney stones, try a half-and-half combination of corn silk and marsh- mallow. For use as a kidney tonic, corn silk combines with marshmallow, hawthorn, ginkgo, or goldenrod. For use in FLUTD, corn silk combines with couch grass, echinacea, marshmallow, and horsetail. Cautions and Comments: Corn silk is known to be safe, but this herb is actu- ally the pollen-receiving part of the plant. It stands to reason that animals with pollen allergies may have adverse reactions to corn silk. Corn silk has been shown to stimulate uterine con- tractions in rabbits and therefore should be used with caution (if at all) in pregnant animals. COUCH GRASS Agropyron repens Grass Family Appearance: If you are a gardener, you probably already know, and hate, this plant by the name quack grass. Couch grass (pronounced “cooch grass” in much of Europe, its native birthplace and medic- inal origin) is a profusely common weed in North America. To the untrained eye, Agropyron repens looks like every other Zea mays Herbs for Pets 92 waist-high wild grass—with perhaps the most distinctive exception displayed by its leaves. Each leaf, or blade, of couch grass looks as though somebody pinched a crimp in it 1 or 2 inches away from the tip. While this does not serve as a definitive means of identification, it provides a good point from which you can begin the process of ruling out look-alike grasses in your area, one species at a time. If you wish to gather this plant for medicinal use, find some samples of what you think might be couch grass, and then take them to your county extension agent, a botanist, or somebody else who can iden- tify grasses. Unless you are experienced at using a botanical key (a scientific reference used to identify plants through recogni- tion of their taxonomic features), identify- ing couch grass is hit or miss. Fortunately, the look-alike grasses are not toxic—but they’re probably not medicinal. Habitat and Range: Couch grass is native to the Mediterranean area. It now makes itself at home virtually everywhere on earth. In North America, expect to find it in areas where livestock grazing, farming, or other human-related activi- ties have delivered the seeds. Cycle and Bloom Season: An aggres- sive perennial that reproduces by seed or spreading rhizomes (horizontally creep- ing roots) Parts Used: Rhizomes Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, astringent, anti-inflammatory, mild diuretic Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract Preparation: Tincture or decoction of the fresh or freshly dried rhizomes. Use fresh leaves as a dietary supplement. Common Uses: Historically, many ani- mal lovers have come to know A. repens as dog grass because dogs, cats, and other animals love eating the fresh spring leaves of the plant. Our dogs are no exception—we have clumps of dog grass growing in front of our house, and whenever an opportunity arises (one that doesn’t interfere with a game of Frisbee), our dogs both actively graze on the plants. It’s interesting to watch how they actually differentiate the couch grass from other grasses in their intuitive drive to eat the plants. But even more interesting is the way our dogs instinc- tively use this plant to fulfill special health care needs. Specifically, they eat couch grass to the point of vomiting, and while humans may find this some- what disgusting, an inquisitive herbalist with a holistically oriented mind can clearly see what the animals are doing. They are either using the grass as a digestive cleansing agent or they are vomiting so they can reingest their stom- ach contents. The latter may be indica- tive of poor nutrient absorption—eating food twice, in effect, allows for more complete absorption of certain nutrients. The point is this: if your animal eats grass, the grass is likely to fill a nutrition- al or medicinal need, and such activities should not be overlooked when assess- ing your animal’s holistic health—even if you do wish to look away and forget about it. As a food, a patch of couch grass pro- vides grazing animals with a rich source of vitamins A and B, iron, rough fiber, and silica (for healthy bones, hooves, nails, and coat). But most of the medici- nal value of couch grass is contained within the rhizomes of the plant. Couch grass serves as an excellent tonic and disinfectant for the urinary tract. It is a soothing, anti-inflammatory demulcent and saponin-based diuretic C Materia Medica 93 c with mild antimicrobial activity. Couch grass is considered a specific remedy for chronic or acute cases of cystitis and ure- thritis, where the root tea or tincture helps to reduce inflammation, inhibit bacterial reproduction, and lessen pain during urination. It should be noted that although couch grass has been shown to possess broad antibiotic activity, it may be too weak to be effective against infec- tions that are already well established. In such cases, couch grass should be com- bined with stronger antimicrobial herbs such as echinacea, thyme, or Oregon grape (or certified organic goldenseal— don’t buy wildcrafted goldenseal because the plant is at risk of becoming extinct). As a diuretic, couch grass increases the volume of urine by stimulating sodi- um excretion, helping to wash away waste materials from the body via the kidneys. This makes couch grass an effec- tive adjunct to a variety of liver- supporting, alterative herbs (such as dandelion or burdock), especially in the treatment of rheumatism or chronic skin problems. The demulcent properties of couch grass soothe inflammation, so it can also be used for kidney stones and gravel. And because couch grass is gentle on the kidneys and seldom irritates the bladder or urethra during long-term use, it is a primary herb to consider when treating the symptoms of FLUTD in cats, a condi- tion that is usually due to factors other than infection. For use in urinary problems, the best way to administer this herb is in the form of a cooled decoction. Make the decoction by gently simmering a heap- ing teaspoon of the chopped dried root, or 2 heaping teaspoons of the chopped fresh root (rhizomes), in 8 ounces of water for about twenty min- utes. The decoction can be squirted directly into the animal’s mouth. A safe starting dose is about a 1⁄2 teaspoon (2–3 milliliters) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, two to three times daily. If direct administration is too difficult, the dose can be added to the animal’s drinking water. Try to figure out how much your animal drinks, then add enough couch grass to meet dosing requirements. Glycerin or alcohol tinc- tures can be used at half the above dosage and are best if diluted into water. Keep in mind that this is a subtle herbal medicine—the needs and sys- temic requirements of the animal you are helping may require several increas- es in dosage over several days or weeks of administration. Availability: Couch grass is not a pop- ular herb in the U.S. (although it is pop- ular in Europe), and some of the dried Agropyron repens Herbs for Pets 94 rhizomes that you find in herb stores are on the verge of becoming useless dust. Fortunately, it grows everywhere. The only problem is identifying it among other weeds and finding the physical stamina to dig up the stubborn rhi- zomes. If you meet these criteria, you can easily become a garden hero in your neighborhood. (On the other hand, everyone may think you’re nuts for actu- ally wanting the weed.) The golden rule: Beware of pesticides. Finding “clean” couch grass is often difficult. Propagation and Harvest: As far as propagating couch grass is concerned, go ahead if you don’t mind sacrificing the engine on your tiller and if you don’t care if the plant strangles the rest of your garden. The rhizomes can be harvested anytime throughout the growth season but are usually strongest when dug up in the fall. The best medicines are made from the fresh rhizomes, but dried roots are useful, too, if used within a year of digging. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For urinary inflammations that are secondary to infec- tion, combine with Oregon grape, organi- cally raised goldenseal, thyme, or echi- nacea. For stones or any other cause of uri- nary tract inflammation, marshmallow, corn silk, and plantain are valuable adjuncts. If blood is present in the urine, see your holistic veterinarian—your pet needs stronger measures than couch grass. Cautions and Comments: No toxicity has been noted for couch grass, although excessive amounts may lead to vomiting or diarrhea. Always be careful about veri- fying the cleanliness of the sources of this herb—it is on just about everybody’s “noxious weed” list, and pesticide residues can remain with the plant for sev- eral years. DANDELION Taraxacum officinale Sunflower Family Appearance: It’s time for all good herbalists to put their egos aside. Dandelion is actually confused with several other species of the sunflower family, and although we may hate to admit it, many of us have been fooled into using one of the look-alikes. The primary consideration to bear in mind when identifying Taraxacum officinale or any of its hundreds of variations is this: Dandelion has no branching char- acteristics but instead grows in a rosette fashion directly off of its tap- root. And dandelion never has spines on its midrib as does Lactuca serriola (prickly lettuce), which otherwise looks similar to dandelion when young. Although dandelion impostors likely won’t harm you, they won’t offer you dandelion’s benefits, either. Habitat and Range: A native of Europe and Asia, dandelion has found its way onto every continent—except maybe Antarctica. Cycle and Bloom Season: Dandelion is a perennial that may bloom several times throughout the year. In areas where there is severe winter climate, dandelion may appear only as a free- seeding annual. Parts Used: All parts of the plant are useful for various applications. Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic, stimulates the liver, stimulates salivation and improves digestion (bitter), nutritive, laxative, anti-inflammatory, tonic Strongest Affinities: Liver, gallblad- der, gastrointestinal tract D Materia Medica 95 d Preparation: Water infusion, decoc- tion, tincture, fresh or dried leaves and flowers Common Uses: To begin an accurate assessment of dandelion’s deep-reaching medicinal attributes, we must first put healing into a whole-body perspective. All higher organisms (including dogs, cats, birds, mice, lizards, goats, and humans) maintain vital body functions within tightly knit parameters of sys- temic cooperation. A precise and bal- anced relationship between nutrition and elimination of waste is a critical part of this cooperation. If a systemic excess or deficiency occurs that the body can- not correct through elimination, supple- mentation, or immune system interven- tion, it will try to compensate by shut- ting down a system or storing waste materials wherever it can. In other words, a state of “dis-ease” results. Enter the dandelion. Dandelion is one of the most com- plete plant foods on earth. A 1-cup serv- ing of fresh dandelion greens provides as much as 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A (one and a half times the rec- ommended daily allowance [RDA] for an adult human); 20 percent protein (by content, that’s double what spinach pro- vides); vitamins C, K, D, and B complex; iron, manganese, phosphorus, and many other trace minerals; and an especially rich supply of potassium. All of these vital nutrients are conveniently contained within a single source in quantities that the body can fully absorb. This means that dandelion can gently supplement a diet without overworking the liver and kidneys with excess vitamins and minerals (which is often signified by dark urine). Supplementing your companion ani- mal’s diet with dandelion leaf is as sim- ple as drying the greens and crumbling them onto her food. If your animal doesn’t like eating dandelion or if you need to get nutrients into her more quickly, try making a leaf tea using organic unsalted vegetable or meat broth in place of plain water. Plan on feeding about 1 teaspoon of the dried herb for each 20 pounds of body weight daily. Horses, llamas, sheep, goats, mules, and other large animals often eat the greens directly out of their pastures. If they don’t, try hand feeding the greens to them or adding a little molasses. If your animal is sensitive to changes in diet, then start her off with a small amount of dandelion at a time. In addition to providing your animal with many of the nutrients she needs, the leaves have what herbalists call a bit- ter tonic effect: the body’s metabolism is “warmed up” before the digestive sys- tem is forced to go to work. When a Taraxacum officinale Herbs for Pets 96 small amount of a bitter herb is taken into the mouth, the recipient immediate- ly experiences a sudden increase in sali- vation. As the bitter herb reaches the stomach, bile and other digestive agents are then triggered into production. The result is more efficient digestion, reduced indigestion, better absorption of nutrients, and increased appetite. Dandelion leaf is particularly useful in animals who have a chronic problem with indigestion. If your animal has fre- quent gas or passes food that does not appear digested, get her to chew a fresh dandelion leaf while you reconsider her diet, or apply a few drops of dandelion tincture (an herbal glycerite is most palatable) onto her tongue. It does not matter if the animal doesn’t appear to swallow it; the bitter tonic action is trig- gered in the mouth. Dandelion is well known among herbalists as a safe but powerful diuretic and liver stimulant. Congestive heart fail- ure, pulmonary edema, arthritis, gallblad- der disease, and kidney stones are all imbalances resulting from the body’s inability to eliminate water or accumulat- ed excesses. In mainstream practices, drugs such as furosemide are often used to drain off excess fluid from the body and thus promote the elimination of accumulated waste materials. Pharma- ceutical diuretics are fast acting, easy to administer, and effective, but while they do a great job at expelling fluid, they tend not to discriminate between what the body needs to keep and what it needs to lose. As a result, the body often loses too much potassium, a crucial heart and brain nutrient, through urination. In this event, potassium must be supplemented throughout the therapy. Dandelion leaf, on the other hand, contains its own rich source of fully assimilable potassium, an attribute that helps to replace what would otherwise be lost through urination. How effective is dandelion as a diuret- ic? Many contemporary herbalists claim that dandelion may be as effective as the aforementioned furosemide. The big trade-offs, though, are ease of adminis- tration, getting enough of the tea into the animal to bring about desired effects, and the time that it may take for dandelion to start working. While furosemide can be administered in a lit- tle pill, a dandelion therapy involves get- ting your animal to drink warm tea or take a tincture extract (the broth method works nicely). None of this is meant to encourage you to stop the diuretic ther- apy prescribed by your veterinarian. If you wish to seek the dandelion alterna- tive, see a holistic veterinarian first. While dandelion leaves are nutritive and diuretic, the root possesses its own usefulness as a safe, reliable liver tonic. The liver is the primary filtering organ of the body; it is responsible for removing toxins and excesses from the blood for elimination via the kidneys. The liver also plays critical roles in digestion through its production of bile, bilirubin, and vari- ous enzymes. If bile ducts in the liver or gallbladder become congested, blocked, or otherwise diseased to the point of dysfunction, the body invariably suffers one or more toxicity-related imbalances. Such imbalances may be characterized by symptoms such as jaundice, rheuma- toid conditions, eczema, dandruff, or chronic constipation. And while dande- lion leaf tea or tincture may do much toward relieving the symptoms of such conditions through a nutritive and diuretic action, the root will have more effect on the underlying causes. Dandelion root has a well-validated ability to stimulate bile production and circulation throughout the liver. In one study involving dogs, researchers observed a three to four times increase in bile production after administration of D Materia Medica 97 d dandelion root. The gallbladder, which stores bile from the liver, is also stimulat- ed, causing this small, hollow organ to contract and release bile into the diges- tive tract, thus aiding in digestion and acting as a gentle laxative to promote the elimination of solid waste. One of the best features about dande- lion root as a liver and gallbladder stimu- lant is its gentle nature. Unlike many chol- agogue herbs, dandelion does not further irritate an already inflamed condition. In fact, in clinical studies using an over-the- counter preparation of the root, dandelion was shown to be effective in treating inflammatory diseases of the liver and gall- bladder, including gallstones. The flowers of dandelion are known by herbalists to be high in lecithin and to have weak but useful analgesic qualities. Their usefulness as a pain reliever stems from the fact that they don’t contain any salicylates, the alkaloid compounds found in aspirin that are toxic to cats and may be irritating to the stomach lining. To use the flowers, infuse a generous handful in a cup of near-boiling water. When the water has darkened as much as possible, it can be cooled and administered with a dropper: 30–40 drops per 20 pounds of body weight. If this proves to be too difficult for you and your animal, try drying the flow- ers and sprinkling them on her food. You shouldn’t expect aspirin-like effectiveness, but this is a mild painkilling option worth considering. Dandelion is perhaps the first herb to consider when optimized digestion and waste elimination is a necessary part of an herbal therapy. In holistic healing, the body, whether it be human or another kind of animal, should not be viewed as a collection of individual body systems but as an intricately balanced coopera- tion of relative components. From this perspective, it is easy to see how dande- lion can serve a positive role in its effort to help the body at what it is designed to do—stay healthy. The body cannot achieve this goal unless it is able to effec- tively utilize nutrients and eliminate waste—and dandelion is here to help. Availability: Everywhere! Propagation and Harvest: If you wish to propagate dandelion (no, we’re not insane), give the plants deep humus-rich soil and full sun. Gather dandelion greens for use in salads in early spring— they get bitter with age. Leaves intended for herbal teas and medicines can be gathered anytime in dry weather. Wet dandelion leaves tend to develop mold while they are drying, so don’t wash them after picking. Shake them off and dry them on newspapers in a well-venti- lated area, away from light. Then stir them often to prevent molding and store them in plastic bags only after they are completely crispy dry. Gather the roots as late in fall as possible; this is when they contain the greatest concen- tration of beneficial constituents. Chop them up (we use a food processor), then spread them onto newspaper and dry with the same consideration you gave to the leaves. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For liver and digestive problems, consider milk thistle, burdock, yellow dock, marshmal- low, chickweed, and Oregon grape as possible adjuncts or alternatives. Cautions and Comments: The first and foremost consideration in using dan- delion as food or medicine is the cleanli- ness of the plants you are using. Always make sure that the greens you are feed- ing have never been sprayed with herbi- cide. If they ever have, don’t try washing them. Move on to another patch. You won’t have trouble finding more. Herbs for Pets 98 DILL Anethum graveolens Parsley Family Appearance: A healthy dill plant is an attractive addition to any herb garden. Plants may reach 6 feet in height. The dark green finely divided leaves have a delicate feathery appearance, and the yellow umbel (umbrella-like) flowers are attrac- tive to bees. The entire plant is distinctive- ly aromatic and delicious—just brushing past one can make your mouth water! Habitat and Range: Originally a native of southeast Europe and southwest Asia, dill is a common resident in herb gar- dens worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms in early to midsummer, dill is successful at reproducing from the copious quantities of viable seed it pro- duces shortly after blooming. Parts Used: Foliage, flowers, and seeds Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, soothes the stomach (stomachic), stimulates milk production, antibacterial, diuretic Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract Preparation: Feeding of the fresh or dried herb, tea, tincture, poultice Common Uses: Dill is good for relieving nausea and flatulence, especially when these maladies are secondary to a sudden change in diet—such as when your puppy decides to steal a tamale from your foolishly unattended dinner plate. The effectiveness of dill in this capacity is largely attributable to the plant’s numer- ous volatile oil constituents, which com- bine to cause an antifoaming action in the stomach, like many over-the-counter anti- gas remedies. The highest concentrations of these oils are held within the seeds of the plant, but the dried leaves and stems (the herb you likely have in the kitchen) can be used too. If your dog is belching something that is suspiciously reminiscent of what was supposed to be your dinner and the problem appears to be getting progressively worse, try direct-feeding 2–8 ounces of cooled dill seed tea (1 tea- spoon of dill seed to 8 ounces of water) to the animal. If your animal doesn’t like the flavor, try adding the tea to her drinking water—or, if need be, disguise it as “yummy people food” by making the tea with some clear, unsalted broth instead of water. If belching, bloating, or other forms of indigestion are a problem after every feeding, call a holistic veterinarian and reassess your animal’s diet. Think holistically—a sprinkling of ground dill seed on your pet’s food may bring about symptomatic relief, but if the condition is ongoing, a deeper problem needs to be addressed. In addition to providing relief from excess gas, dill also possesses antibac- terial qualities that are strong enough to inhibit bacterial reproduction in the mouth but too weak to compromise beneficial microbes deeper in the diges- tive tract. This makes dill useful for treating halitosis and the early onset of gingivitis in dogs and cats. The herb or seeds can be infused and added to drinking water, or a poultice or glycerin tincture can be swabbed on the ani- mal’s gum line two or three times daily. Dill is useful for treating mild to moderate cases of colic. If they will take it, horses and other large herbivores can be fed the seeds or even the entire fresh plant—as much as they need. Dill seed contains carvone, anetho- furan, and limonene, volatile oils that have been shown to increase the pro- D Materia Medica 99 E duction of cancer-fighting enzymes (namely, glutathione s-transferase, or GST) in the body. These enzymes react with certain types of carcinogenic chemicals, eliminating them from the system. While this in itself represents only a small measure of cancer preven- tion, it makes dill another medicinal food to consider when custom-tailoring your animal’s diet plan. While dill con- tains limonene, a substance known to repel fleas, its presence is not large enough to be of use by itself. The carvone that dill contains, how- ever, is believed to increase the effective- ness of various other natural insecticides (such as those contained in feverfew or oxeye daisy), making dill a useful adjunct in the never-ending battle against fleas. Dill has a folkloric reputation as a sub- stance that stimulates the production of milk in nursing mothers. Availability: The grocery store or your favorite nursery Propagation and Harvest: Dill is easy to grow from seed or starts and can be seeded in fall for an early spring harvest in areas where winters are harsh. In areas where the growing season is long but not too hot, a continuous self-seeding crop of dill is not only possible but per- haps inevitable. Harvest the leaves and flowers when they are lush and aromat- ic, the seeds shortly after they have turned brown, before they begin to fall to the ground. This is best accomplished by clipping off the entire umbel, then shaking the seeds into a paper bag. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For gas and other digestive problems, dill com- bines with fennel, parsley seed, or cat- nip. For infections of the mouth, Oregon grape, sage, and thyme are stronger options. For bad breath, a combination of parsley, dill, and peppermint makes an excellent formula. For fleas, try making a skin and coat rinse by combining dill, feverfew flowers, and yarrow into a tea. Cautions and Comments: Dill is safe but because of its volatile oil con- stituents, dill should be used conserva- tively in pregnant or lactating animals. ECHINACEA Echinacea spp. Sunflower Family Appearance: Echinacea, also known as purple, pink, or white coneflower, is a taprooted perennial that may grow as high as 40 inches. Nine species of Echinacea are native to North America; all have flowers with distinctive conelike central disks, with the most common species ranging in color from pale to dark purple. The rays of most species Anethum graveolens Herbs for Pets 100 droop away from the disk when mature. Echinacea purpurea (see photo) is by far the most widely distributed species in North America. For several decades, this species has been popular as a medicinal herb and garden flower. Dozens of vari- eties of E. purpurea have been devel- oped, and it is estimated that the entire world market supply of this species comes from cultivated plants. Several other species, however, such as E. angus- tifolia and E. pallida are quickly succumb- ing to commercial and environmental pressures. Habitat and Range: In the West, echi- nacea is largely an introduced plant. Partial to open plains and woodlands, its natural range once extended from east- ern Canada southward into the Ozarks and westward throughout the corn belt states to the east slopes of the Rockies. Market pressures and continuing loss of habitat have eliminated most of the wild stands of echinacea. Its range continues to shrink, and today only small isolated populations of wild echinacea survive west of the Missouri River. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in early to late summer, depending on climate Parts Used: Most often the root is used. The leaves, stems, and flowers are useful too, although they are much weaker medicine. Primary Medicinal Activities: Immuno- stimulant, antimicrobial Strongest Affinities: Immune system, lymph system, urinary tract Preparation: Tincture, decoction, dried and powdered root, or direct feeding of the fresh leaves, stems, and flowers Common Uses: First and foremost, echinacea is an immune-supporting herb—it serves to support intact immune functions through stimulatory and strengthening actions at various levels within the body. No single constituent contained in the root or flowering upper parts of echinacea can be attributed to the immune-tonifying functions of this plant. Instead, most herbalists agree that the complex structure of this plant should be viewed as a therapeutic syner- gy of dozens of biochemical influences. However, a few key elements stand out as strong clues to exactly how echinacea works. A great deal of scientific research has identified echinacea’s most influential immunostimulatory components as an extensive array of caffeic acids, volatile oils, polysaccharides, polyenes, polyines, and isobutylamides. In simpler terms, echinacea’s immunostimulatory qualities are derived from a wide array of chemical compounds that allow the plant to be used in a variety of forms without sacrificing its effectiveness. For instance, while many of the acid con- stituents in echinacea are poorly water soluble and require a strong alcohol base to extract them into a tincture form, the plant’s polysaccharide con- stituents are exactly the opposite—they are easily extracted into water—and, in fact, they are largely destroyed by alco- hol. Since both of these chemical groups have been shown to possess very strong immunostimulatory quali- ties, it would appear that the plant is naturally designed to accommodate a wide variety of metabolic needs. Echinacea serves to support disease resistance in several ways. At the blood level, it accelerates phagocytosis, the means by which macrophages and other antibodies attack and remove bacteria. At cellular levels, echinacea helps to E Materia Medica 101 e reduce the production of an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, the com- pound that occurs between cells to bind them together. Eliminating this enzyme at the onset of an infection is believed to make body tissues less pervious to invad- ing microbes and, in turn, the invaders more vulnerable to scavenging antibod- ies that have already been stimulated into action. Echinacea has also been shown to stimulate the lymph system, thus helping the body to eliminate waste materials from the tissues. And it pos- sesses measurable antimicrobial qualities that assist the body’s fight against infec- tion by intervening with bacteria at the point of invasion. Echinacea’s multidirectional means of immune system support, its primary usefulness, depends on a healthy immune system. Without a healthy pop- ulation of unencumbered antibodies to work with, echinacea’s capacity to fight infection is limited to its simple, and less-than-impressive, antiseptic actions. This means that timing is critical to echi- nacea’s effectiveness—this herb should be taken at the first onset of infectious symptoms, otherwise its activity will amount to a losing battle fought against microbial opponents that have already fortified their positions within the ani- mal’s body. Learn to recognize minute variances in your animal’s behavior and feeding habits. Take extra time to give your pet a cursory examination during your daily grooming session or playtimes, and look for anything that may point to the intro- duction of an infection—an inflamed gum, a swollen fleabite, or a slightly runny nose may be indicators for the proactive use of echinacea. If you are too late and an infection has set in, it’s time to consider calling in some other troops from the herbal army. Don’t despair. Try boosting echinacea with a small percent- age of an antiseptic herb such as Oregon grape, usnea, or organically grown gold- enseal. By combining echinacea with about 10 percent by weight or volume of one of these other herbs, you will be offering a small measure of direct antiseptic intervention without compro- mising populations of the beneficial microbes the body needs in its fight. Applying antiseptics topically, directly onto the point of infection, also aids in the healing effort. So how much echinacea should you give, for how long, and in what form? Many people think that the potency of an echinacea preparation can be deter- mined by the intensity of the tingling sensation it causes when placed on the tongue. If this is your current method of judging echinacea preparations, please abandon it. A great deal of recent and continuing research has shown that the isobutylamides responsible for this sen- sation represent only a fragment of echi- nacea’s active constituents and that their absence may not affect the overall effectiveness of echinacea. The more we learn about echinacea, the more com- plex and diverse its medicinal actions seem to be. There is no best kind of echinacea preparation per se. As long as care and quality have gone into its propagation, its harvest, and the manufacture of the end product, all echinacea preparations contain adequate medicinal constituents. The question of what preparation to use internally in your animal hinges on how easy or difficult it is to get a therapeutic quantity into the animal. Echinacea is by no means a good-tasting herb, and its administration is complicated by the fact that dogs and cats have short digestive tracks and fast metabolic rates. In these animals, the problem isn’t finding a preparation that contains high enough concentrations of active constituents but Herbs for Pets 102 finding one that is both palatable and fully assimilable by their short digestive tracts. Cats in particular don’t like alco- hol and the sour tingle that alcohol extracts impart on the tongue. (They typically foam at the mouth and some- times act as if you are force-feeding them a vile, poisonous fluid.) Dogs typically drink from toilets without complaint and are somewhat less picky, and since gel capsules often pass directly through them undigested, we prefer to use low- alcohol glycerin extracts for our carni- vores. Glycerin-based preparations are low in tongue-tingling isobutylamides but rich in readily available polysaccha- ride constituents, and the sweet taste of the vegetable glycerin helps mask the unpleasant flavor of the herb. Herbivores are naturally designed to efficiently metabolize plant materials; horses, goats, llamas, and other large animals can be fed the flowering plants, or dried root can be added to their feed. Dosage and duration of use vary based upon the needs and individual nuances of the animal, but a conserva- tive rule for dogs and cats is to give 12–25 drops of the tincture three times daily. Horses, cattle, sheep, and other large animals can be fed a couple of handfuls of the dried whole flowering herb per day. Several high-quality pow- dered echinacea preparations are now available for equines and other large animals as well. Use them as directed by your veterinarian or as suggested on the label. In recent years, a rather heated con- troversy has arisen within the herbalist community concerning how long echi- nacea can be used before the body builds a tolerance to its immune-stimu- lating actions. In a German study con- ducted in 1989, a diminished response to echinacea was recorded in human subjects after five to ten days of normal dose administration. This result raised questions of whether echinacea is effec- tive when used over the long term. Closer scrutiny of this study, however, has since led to the conclusion that while echinacea’s activity does fall off sharply after about five days of use, its long-term use still maintains a level of immune sys- tem activity higher than that observed prior to its initial administration. Many herbalists believe that breaking the con- tinuity of echinacea use every five to ten days allows for a greater immune boost each time the therapy is reestablished after a two- or three-day respite. We agree and believe that a break is neces- sary, in any case, to monitor the unassist- ed recovery of the animal. Five days on, two or three days off is a good guideline to follow. Aside from its immune-stimulating qualities, echinacea is a good antimicro- bial for the mouth and urinary tract. It is useful for treating bacterial or fungal infections of the bladder and urethra, especially when added to a demulcent and anti-inflammatory combination of herbs. Echinacea also has a long-stand- ing reputation as a snakebite remedy. Used internally and externally simultane- ously, the herb is said to antidote the venom. Although little scientific evi- dence exists to support such claims, hun- dreds of years’ worth of use amounts to more than folkloric trivia. Knowing that about 85 percent of rattlesnake bites involve only a partial injection of venom (or no injection at all), it is likely that echinacea serves more to ward off infec- tion and prevent tissue damage than to actually nullify the venom. Echinacea relieves the pain and swelling of most insect bites and stings, especially when applied as a clay poultice. Echinacea is also used with some suc- cess for colic in horses, with free-feeding of the fresh leaves, stems, and flowers E Materia Medica 103 e being the most popular method of administration. Availability: Various preparations of echinacea are widely available through health product retailers. The seeds and plants are available through most nurs- eries. Because of continuing overharvest, wild stands of this plant are at risk of dis- appearing forever. Please make sure that the echinacea you are using is from cul- tivated sources. Propagation and Harvest: Echinacea purpurea, the primary echinacea of com- merce, is easy to grow and requires little care once the plants are established. Seeds require cold, damp stratification and light to break their dormancy. This means that the seeds must be sown on top of the soil or covered with just a trace of soil in order to germinate. Roots must be at least three years old to be of medicinal value. The plants are hardy and drought tolerant when mature. A well-established stand of echinacea reseeds itself, and mature plants can bear roots of up to 3 pounds each. Varieties such as E. pallida and E. angustifolia are much more finicky. Before you choose to grow them, bear in mind that despite what herbalists once thought, the gardener-friendly E. pur- purea provides medicine that is as potent as these other species. Dig mature echinacea roots from the garden after the plant has gone dormant for the winter, following its third year of growth. The roots can be chopped and tinctured while fresh or dried and ground for use in teas. The dried roots can be tinctured as well. Leaves, stems, and flowers can be selectively harvested when they are in full bloom in midsummer. If you opt to do this, bear in mind that a preponder- ance of leaves and flowers must remain on the plants to provide life support for the roots and to produce viable seeds. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Virtually any of the alterative, diuretic, chola- gogue, or expectorant herbs combine well with echinacea to support the body during microbial infections. To help fight infections of the mouth, digestive tract, or urinary tract, echinacea serves as an excellent adjunct to Oregon grape or couch grass. As a lymphatic, echinacea combines well with cleavers. Cautions and Comments: Echinacea is a very safe herb. But remember, echi- nacea can only be expected to support a healthy immune system. If the animal is malnourished or immune-compro- mised by preexisting disease or by other factors, you should consider dietary changes and/or other measures that feed and support the immune Echinacea purpurea Herbs for Pets 104 system before jumping into Echinacea therapy. Before using echinacea, it is a good idea to consult a holistic veterinar- ian—especially if you are uncertain of your animal’s level of disease resistance. ELECAMPANE Inula helenium Sunflower Family Appearance: Elecampane is a stout, impressive plant. Healthy specimens may grow in excess of 6 feet high. We have seen these plants in tightly clustered hedgelike stands so thick that one can- not see daylight through them. The nar- rowly lance-shaped leaves may exceed 16 inches in length and 4 inches in width. The daisylike flowers may reach 4 inches in diameter, are burnt orange, and have narrow rays that contrast with the robust overall appearance of the plant—a splendid addition to any herb or flower garden! Habitat and Range: Probably a native of southeastern Europe, elecampane has become naturalized throughout much of Europe and the eastern portions of the U.S. It has been cultivated throughout much of the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that generally blooms in early to mid- summer Parts Used: Rhizomes (roots) Primary Medicinal Activities: Expect- orant; sedative; respiratory stimulant; lubricates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; antibacterial, fun- gicide, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Lungs Preparation: Decoction or tincture Common Uses: Elecampane has long been regarded as a valuable medicine for a wide variety of lung disorders. Among herbalists, it is regarded as an expectorant that also lends antibacter- ial support, mild cough-suppressive qualities, and relief to mucous mem- branes by virtue of its slippery, oily, soothing mucilage. In other words, elecampane helps make coughing more productive by stimulating excre- tion of mucus, acts to protect and lubricate inflamed mucous membranes in the respiratory tract while inhibiting bacterial infection, and serves to sup- press the cough response just enough so that the body is relieved of unneces- sary stress. Unfortunately, relatively lit- tle scientific study has been performed to support all of these claims. Science has uncovered evidence to suggest that elecampane may have sedative qualities in mice, and we know that Inula helenium E Materia Medica 105 F it contains a volatile oil constituent called alantolactone, which is active against roundworms, whipworms, threadworms, and hookworms in hu- mans. Regardless of a lack of scientific study, this plant has been used for thousands of years as a treatment for bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculo- sis—and it is regarded by herbalists as safe enough for use in children with a dry, irritating cough. In animals, we find it useful for soothing a raspy hack that is the result of too much trail dust or perhaps even for kennel cough. Proper dose and duration of therapy must be determined through recogni- tion of specific symptoms and should be based on the special needs of the individual animal. Most of what we know about this herb is centered on the hands-on experience of those who are familiar with it. Therefore, if ele- campane seems to be a viable option for your animal, seek the advice of a holistic practitioner before you pro- ceed with its use. Availability: The dried rhizome or tinc- ture is available through herb retailers. Plants, root cuttings, and seeds are avail- able through specialty nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Elecampane likes full sun and a moist clay loam with an acid pH of 4.5 to 6. Aside from these requirements, you can grow it just about anywhere. Roots are dug in the fall of their second year. They can then be processed into tincture while fresh or dried in a warm location for future use. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For res- piratory disorders associated with heavy congestion, elecampane com- bines well with mullein or grindelia. For kennel cough, it can be combined with coltsfoot. Cautions and Comments: Elecampane has been shown to be highly allergenic in animals and humans with sensitivity to plants in the sunflower (Asteraceae) family. FENNEL Foeniculum vulgare Parsley Family Appearance: Fennel looks very much like dill—delicate finely divided leaves, yellow umbel flowers, and hollow stems. The most obvious difference between fennel and dill is the aromatic nature of the plants—fennel smells somewhat like anise (or licorice), whereas dill smells like, well, dill pickles. Fennel also has sturdier stems and a proportionately large bulb, which is considered a gour- met delicacy by salad and sautéed veg- etable connoisseurs. The entire plant may grow in excess of 6 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Native to Eurasia, fennel has become a full-time, natural- ized resident in the southern half of California, where it is frequently found on the edges of waste areas. Cycle and Bloom Season: There are many subspecies of Foeniculum vulgare— many are perennials, others are annuals or biennials. In northern climes, fennel usually grows as an annual. Parts Used: Seeds, leaves, roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, relieves stomach cramps, stimulates milk production, stimulates digestion, nutritive, and antibacterial Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract Preparation: Fresh or dried leaves, seeds, or roots; or a tincture of the seeds or roots Herbs for Pets 106 Common Uses: Fennel seed is among the first herbs to reach for in cases of flatulence or colic. Its activity in the digestive tract is similar to that of cat- nip. Fennel tastes different from any mint, however, and its flavor is often favored by dogs and cats who dislike “minty” herbs. About 20 percent of cats won’t go near a flake of catnip, making fennel the herb of choice for gastric upset and irritability. In chronic cases, it serves as a gentle antigas and antispas- modic agent that can be added directly to the animal’s food to bring sympto- matic relief while the caretaker looks for the deeper cause of the problem. In acute cases, such as when your horse finds an open bag of molasses and oats that you forgot to put away (or when she grazes on too much fresh alfalfa because you left a gate open), fennel may help to reduce the subsequent bloating that is caused by intestinal gas buildup. For flatulence or colic, horses can be free-fed fresh fennel greens—as much as they want—until they find relief. For dogs and cats, fennel seed works to relieve gastric discomfort from the “no-no’s” that are inevitably con- sumed as a result of human weakness such as tidbits fed from the Thanksgiving dinner table or from the dishes that “can wait until morning.” A cooled tea works well for this purpose— 1 teaspoon of the fresh or dried seeds (fresh are better) in 8 ounces of boiling water, steeped until cool. The tea can be fed at a rate of 2–4 tablespoons for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, or it can be added to drinking water as generously as the animal will allow. A glycerin tincture also works well, especially for finicky animals, because it allows for the convenience of a small dosage of 10–20 drops (or more precisely, up to 0.75 milliliters) per 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, as need- ed. Fennel is high in vitamin C, vitamin A, calcium, iron, and potassium and has varying amounts of linoleic acid. It is an especially good nutritional adjunct for dogs and cats with chronic indigestion that cannot be attributed to a specific disease entity. Fennel also helps increase appetite and reduce bad breath by mini- mizing belching and by acting as an anti- bacterial in the mouth. The leaf tea is said to be an effective skin and coat rinse for repelling fleas. Traditionally, fennel is fed to increase milk flow in nursing mothers. Availability: Fennel seed, root, and sometimes the greens can be found in food stores that stock specialty vegeta- bles. Fennel tinctures are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Fennel is easy to grow from seed or nursery Foeniculum vulgare f Materia Medica 107 f starts. It does best in areas with a cool climate and likes light, dry, slightly alkaline soil. The seeds should be har- vested in the fall, just as they begin to dry and turn to a light brown color. The leaves and flowers can be harvested and used anytime. For food use, the 1- inch-wide bulbs are “blanched” throughout the remainder of their growth by covering them with hills of soil. This makes the bulbs white and tender with a mild flavor. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Catnip serves as an excellent alternative, as does anise seed, celery seed, or dill seed. For chronic flatulence, try using a bitter herb such as dandelion leaf or Oregon grape a few minutes before each feeding. Fennel can then be used after meals if flatulence persists. Cautions and Comments: The volatile oils in fennel are thought to cause or contribute to photosensitive dermatitis in some animals, but such occurrences are rare. In general, this herb is safe. FEVERFEW Tanacetum parthenium Sunflower Family Appearance: Feverfew is a stout, fast- growing plant with sturdy ridged stems, deeply divided alternate leaves, and yel- low-centered white flowers that look like miniature (1-inch-wide) white daisies. The entire plant is aromatic. Habitat and Range: Feverfew is native to the Balkan region of Europe and has since been naturalized throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial or biennial that usually blooms from June through August Parts Used: All aerial parts Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- inflammatory, helps reduce arthritic inflammation (antirheumatic), dilates blood vessels, insecticidal, promotes menstruation Strongest Affinities: Vascular, gas- trointestinal, and reproductive systems Preparation: Dried herb, tincture, and tea Common Uses: Feverfew has become a well-known remedy for migraine suffer- ers. Several studies have shown that part of its effectiveness in treating migraines is attributable to a group of chemicals known as sesquiterpene lactones (espe- cially parthenolide) that are contained in the plants’ leaves and flowers. These com- pounds act to inhibit platelet aggregation Tanacetum parthenium Herbs for Pets 108 in the bloodstream, thus preventing blockage of small capillaries and helping to relieve the pounding, high-pressure pain of a migraine headache. In animals, this activity helps relieve posttrauma or postsurgical discomfort, especially where capillary circulation is diminished or impaired. Feverfew has been shown to block or inhibit the release of histamine, serotonin, thromboxane, and prosta- glandins, while inhibiting proliferation of certain types of mononuclear cells in the synovia of injured or arthritic joints. This means that feverfew might be useful in the proactive reduction of inflammation associated with arthritis, joint injuries, and various other diseases. Feverfew is especially useful in cats as an alternative to aspirin, which can be toxic to felines. And many of the classic anti-inflammatory herbs, including wil- low, poplar, and meadowsweet, contain salicylic acids, the natural precursors to aspirin. Feverfew may not address pain as directly as aspirin, but it does not con- tain any salicylate compounds and can therefore be used with a greater margin of safety. A glycerin-based tincture works well for this purpose, as does a cooled tea. A safe starting dosage is 12–20 drops of the tincture or 1⁄2 teaspoon of a strong tea for each 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. The upper parts of feverfew (especial- ly the flowers) contain pyrethrins, com- pounds that are known to paralyze fleas. To make a flea rinse for your pet, pour boiling water over some fresh herbs. Cover the container, and let the mixture stand until it is completely cooled. Strain the herb from the liquid, and pour the liquid onto your animal’s coat, making sure that it soaks down to the skin. Do not towel dry your pet. Let the rinse dry naturally and be sure to use all of the rinse as the pyrethrin will not remain active for more than a few hours. Availability: Feverfew is readily avail- able wherever herbal remedies are sold. The plants are available through most nurseries. For use against fleas, however, you really need a fresh plant—so plant one in your garden. Propagation and Harvest: Feverfew is easy to grow from seed or nursery starts. The plants are extremely winter hardy, drought resistant, and tolerant of poor soil. Tuck a plant into the corner of your garden, give it a little water, and watch it grow. (In fact, it will reseed its way right out of the garden!) Harvest the leaves and flowers as you need them. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For relief from pain and inflammation, feverfew combines well with skullcap, valerian, and licorice. For fighting fleas, combine with yarrow and celery or dill seed. Cautions and Comments: I (Greg) have heard that feverfew should never be fed fresh, because it may cause mouth ulcers. But throughout two decades of using and recommending this herb, I have yet to witness an adverse side effect. Nevertheless, caution dictates that we should take care in assuring that the herb is entirely dried first. FLAX Linum spp. Flax Family Appearance: Almost three hundred species of flax are distributed worldwide. The most common species have bright blue, five-petaled, 1⁄2- to 1-inch-wide flowers, narrow single-veined leaves, small five-chambered fruits, and wirelike stems that sway in the slightest breeze and seem to have a hard time support- ing their own weight. Plants range in height from 6 to 32 inches. f Materia Medica 109 f Habitat and Range: Common blue flax (Linum perenne) and several other blue-flowered species are found in prairies, in open meadows, and along roadways throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or perennial (depending on species) that blooms from June to August and reseeds itself readily Parts Used: Seeds (called flaxseed) Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutri- tive, soothes the digestive tract, laxative, antioxidant, tonic Strongest Affinities: Skin, nervous system, digestive system Preparation: Ground seeds, seed oil, stabilized seeds Common Uses: Flaxseed contains alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, as well as omega-3 fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are important in the develop- ment and maintenance of a healthy brain, liver, heart, and immune system— in fact, these acids are so important, ani- mals cannot survive without them. Several studies have confirmed that omega-3 fatty acids are essential factors in the brain development of young ani- mals and may even help protect the brain against certain types of neurotox- ins. Numerous studies also have shown that daily supplementation with EFAs may dramatically improve the skin, coat, and nails in animals who receive it as a supplement to a good diet. Essential fatty acids have been linked to retinal development and antioxidant activities. The point is this: All animals require EFAs in order to enjoy healthy lives. The prob- lem is that many animals do not receive enough to adequately support their bod- ies’ needs and, as a result, suffer from chronic diseases that could have been easily prevented. Flaxseed oil is one of the richest plant source of omega-3 fatty acids known to humanity—but it is not the “totally complete,” stand-alone source of omega-3 fatty acids we once thought. A piece of the complex puzzle is missing, namely, gamma linolenic acid (GLA)—a fatty acid that is needed to support the body’s inflammatory responses to allergens and other inflam- matory stimuli. The problem is due to the lack of a critical enzyme, called delta- 6 desaturase (or D6D), that is needed to convert the linoleic acid constituents in flax into GLA. Although most mammals, including humans, should be able to produce D6D, most cannot. This is due to environmental factors, such as various pollutants, and perhaps even emotional stress factors, which have been shown to inhibit the body’s production of this Linum sp. Herbs for Pets 110 important enzyme. So if you are searching for a more complete omega-3 supple- ment, you should turn to fish oil, borage seed oil, or chia seed. All of these sources already contain gamma linoleic acids, and no metabolic conversion (or D6D) is required for the body fully utilize it. There are various ways to feed flaxseed to an animal. One option is to buy a nutritional supplement that includes flaxseed as part of a balanced herbal formula. Other options are to buy the seeds in their whole form and grind them immediately before adding them to your companion’s food. You can also use flaxseed oil. When deciding which form of flaxseed is best for you and your companion, you should consider several factors. First, it’s important to know that flaxseed oil (the fraction of the plant that contains the highest concentration of EFAs) becomes rancid very quickly. While flaxseed oil offers omega-3 EFAs in a form that can be fed in relatively small quantities and that is quickly and com- pletely absorbed into the body, it requires constant refrigeration and its shelf life is variable and unpredictable. On the other hand, its flavor is relatively easy to mask in an animal’s food. If you wish to use flax for digestive problems, you will need the seeds. Whole seeds keep for several months if refrigerated but must be ground into powder each time they are used. If you grind them ahead of time, they will quickly spoil. The freshly ground seeds can be used as an EFA supplement, but it’s difficult to gauge the amount of EFAs your animal receives with each feeding because as the seeds age, their EFA content deterio- rates. Another problem with the seed option is palatability—many animals don’t like the flavor of ground flaxseeds, and getting an appreciable amount of the powder into a finicky animal can be challenging. The solution: buy a natural pet product that contains stabilized flaxseed. Stabilized flaxseed is treated with zinc and vitamin B6, which makes the seed taste better and helps to prevent the EFA-containing oil from becoming ran- cid. If you buy a stabilized flaxseed prod- uct that is designed especially for ani- mals, follow the manufacturer’s feeding instructions. You can also buy stabilized flaxseed that is intended for humans and prorate the recommended dose up or down to your animal’s body weight. Human doses are generally based on the needs of a 150-pound person; therefore, if you have a 50-pound dog, you need to feed the dog one-third of the recom- mended dose for humans. It’s also a good idea to consult your veterinarian for the correct dosage for your pet’s weight. If you don’t wish to use a stabilized flaxseed product and have access to a source of fresh flaxseed, buy weekly sup- plies and grind a 1⁄2 teaspoon of the seed into a fine powder for each 20 pounds of your animal’s body weight. Sprinkle the powder onto your companion’s food each day, and be sure that she has plen- ty of water to drink with her meal because flaxseed absorbs water and gains mass while in the stomach. This swelling action is due to the combined fiber, mucilage, and oil content of the seed, which make flaxseed an excellent herb for colic, constipation, and other digestive problems. The oily mucilage of the seed helps lubricate the digestive tract while the swollen fibers serve as a safe but efficient intestinal cleanser (it works the same way as psyllium husks do). For cases of constipation, 1 tea- spoon of ground flaxseed can be thor- oughly mixed with 4 ounces of cool water. Allow the mixture to stand for an hour, or until it thickens—you should be able to rub a drop between your thumb f Materia Medica 111 g and forefinger and feel its oily nature. If the mixture doesn’t feel slippery, add more powder and let it stand again. The idea is to activate the flaxseed before putting it into your companion’s body and thus alleviate any possibility of expansion-related discomfort. Once you get a slippery consistency, 2 teaspoons of the mixture can be fed for each 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight (start with 1⁄2 teaspoon in cats). If possi- ble, the slurry should be fed on an empty stomach so the mixture can work its way throughout the digestive tract. Propagation and Harvest: Flax is easy to grow from seed. Simply scatter the seeds as thinly as possible, rake them into the top 1⁄8 inch of soil, and water thoroughly. Sprouts will usually emerge within seven days. Flax is a pretty border plant, but it really isn’t a practical herb to grow for medicinal purposes. It takes several plants to yield a useful quantity of seed, which must be thrashed and sepa- rated from the stems, leaves, and seed capsules. Without special equipment, this is a tedious task that yields only a handful of seeds that could have been purchased for a few cents at a health food store. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, and black currant seed oil are also excellent sources of EFAs. Flaxseed oil can be combined with cod liver oil or other fish oils to make a rounded supplement of omega- 3 and omega-6 fatty acids. For digestive problems, psyllium husks, plantain, and marshmallow serve as good alternatives. Cautions and Comments: Dry flax- seeds should be fed with plenty of water, otherwise digestive upset and discomfort may result from rapid expansion of the seed fibers in the digestive tract. The best way to avoid this possibility is to premix flaxseed with water prior to feed- ing or to use a balanced flaxseed formu- la that is specially designed to be used in powder form. GARLIC Allium sativum Lily Family Appearance: Need we describe garlic? It’s what makes Italian dishes worth- while. It is the aromatic bulb that repels vampires yet attracts hungry people with its nose-tantalizing, mouthwater- ing scent. While most of us can readily identify a head of garlic in the super- market, relatively few of us are familiar with the living green plant. Garlic is a member of the Allium genus, a branch of the lily family that also includes hun- dreds of varieties of onions, leeks, chives, and shallots. In terms of appear- ance, the numerous varieties of garlic are differentiated from what we know as onions by the nature of their bulbs (commonly known as heads) and their leaves. Commercial varieties of garlic produce heads that are divided into segments (cloves), whereas onion bulbs are comprised of singular, multilayered globes. Garlic leaves are characteristi- cally flat and almost grasslike, whereas most onions’ leaves tend to be hollow and erect. Shallot leaves fall somewhere in between. For the purposes of holistic healing, it’s important to know that all of the Allium species come from the same source—nature. All of the various colors and shapes of onions, garlic, and their relatives have originated from wild Allium species that range throughout the world. On the slopes surrounding our Montana home, several species of wild Allium are among the first greens to emerge from the receding snows of early spring. With their emergence come Herbs for Pets 112 winter-weary bears, grouse, deer, elk, and moose, all of whom wish to indulge, if only briefly, in a snack of garliclike wild onions. As one watches these animals while they browse, it soon becomes apparent that they eat wild onions and garlic to fill some instinctive need other than hunger— they pick and choose only a few select plants, then move on to others. Could it be they know something we don’t? Certainly! It is obvious that nature put the Allium genus here for reasons far deeper than epicurean delight. Fortunately for those who cannot for- age the wilds of North America on behalf of their pets, the “supermarket varieties” of garlic are of optimum medicinal potency. Habitat and Range: It has been the- orized that garlic’s wild ancestors orig- inated from west-central Asia. Garlic’s use as a medicine dates back at least five thousand years, and since then hundreds of cultivars have been prop- agated worldwide. In North America, dozens of varieties can be found in open forest clearings and grasslands at foothill to subalpine elevations. Most are montane residents. Cycle and Bloom Season: Although commercial varieties are typically har- vested during their first year of growth when the bulbs are prime, most Allium species are self-seeding perennials that bloom in midsummer. Parts Used: Bulb (the segments of which are called cloves) Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- bacterial, stimulates the immune system, anticancer, nutritive, antioxidant, expec- torant, lowers blood pressure, antitumor, antiviral, antifungal, tonic Strongest Affinities: Liver, blood, car- diovascular system, immune system Preparation: Fresh, dried, tincture, or oil infusion Common Uses: Garlic contains consid- erable amounts of protein, fiber, potas- sium, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, vitamin A, thiamine, niacin, taurine, zinc, riboflavin, and dozens of other nutritive compounds. A single clove of fresh garlic may contain as much as one hundred sulfur compounds, all of which have been shown to possess medicinal qualities. Most of us who read the ads and labels for garlic preparations or supple- ments at health food stores are continu- ally reminded of allicin—a volatile oil constituent of garlic. Once believed to be the definitive factor in garlic’s healing abilities, allicin represents only a seg- ment of garlic’s complex, medicinally versatile chemistry. This is not to say that allicin is not useful; actually it is one of the most impressive broad-spectrum antimicrobial substances available in nature, with dozens of scientific studies to back up this claim. Researchers have found that allicin may be more effective against harmful microbes than tetracy- cline, a frequently prescribed antibiotic drug. And unlike conventional antibi- otics, garlic works against many forms of virus and won’t compromise populations of beneficial flora in the digestive tract when ingested in the appropriate amounts. Despite its clear value as a healing agent, allicin is not the only healing agent in garlic worth considering. In fact, the presence of allicin in garlic preparations is not required at all in many situations where garlic may prove beneficial. At least thirty other com- pounds that are contained in garlic g Materia Medica 113 g have been shown to be useful for con- ditions that range from skin disorders to cancer. Allicin is an unstable compound that dissipates quickly when exposed to air, moisture, or heat. Unless special meas- ures are taken to preserve it, the allicin content in many garlic preparations are nil by the time they reach someone who needs them. To confront this dilemma, several garlic preparations that have been “standardized to allicin” are avail- able on the market. These extracts, pow- ders, capsules, and tablets have had a certain percentage of allicin added in the laboratory to “guarantee their potency.” Such formulas are safe and effective when used properly for specific antimi- crobial purposes but are generally unnecessary and expensive for use in most other instances where garlic is indi- cated. And, despite the claims of many manufacturers, consumers can’t tell if the allicin content in a standardized preparation still exists at the time of use. Unless a laboratory analysis is performed after the product has reached store shelves, there’s no way of knowing whether the allicin’s potency has van- ished from the formula. Before you use a standardized formu- la, try to find out how the manufacturer can guarantee the allicin content in the product after it leaves the lab. If the company’s answer is satisfactory, then bear in mind that many of garlic’s other medicinal constituents may be absent or overpowered by an unnatural abun- dance of allicin and that you will be using garlic in a manner beyond nature’s design. Regardless of what the manufac- turer might say, nature endows garlic with a specific amount of allicin as well as hundreds of other compounds that serve unified purposes. When we isolate a single constituent from the whole plant, we are no longer working within a natural context, and we limit the healing potential of that plant to the confines of what we know, as opposed to what might be possible. While scientists are beginning to under- stand how single chemical elements and compounds work in or on the body, we still know very little about how they work in a synergistic capacity. In this realm, just beyond our understanding, a great many healing secrets are waiting to be discovered. Any good herbalist will tell you that the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts. The chemical complexity of garlic is good news for the self-reliant herbalist because in addition to allicin, garlic con- tains a multitude of compounds that are stable and easy to use. Despite its wide- spread recognition as a healthy food for humans, garlic demands some added respect, caution, and therapeutic consid- eration if it is to be used effectively in the Allium sativum care of animals. Here are three general rules of proper use: • Allicin is essential in applications where garlic is to be used as a natural form of antibiotic but may not be necessary if you are using garlic for general health maintenance or other purposes. • If you wish to employ garlic as an antibiotic, you need to use raw garlic or raw garlic juice within three hours of chopping or pressing the fresh cloves, or you need a good garlic extract from a reputable source. A properly dried garlic powder may be useful for inter- nal antibiotic applications as well, though only a residual trace of allicin remains in the powder until it is used. In this case, two compounds, alliin and allinase, meet with enzymes to form allicin as they enter the mouth. The allicin then does its work within the body—from the inside out. If you use garlic as a topical antibiotic, bear in mind that raw garlic juice is strong and may cause acute reddening and irritation of skin and mucous mem- branes if applied undiluted. Cut the juice with olive oil, vegetable glycerin, or water at a starting rate of one part pure garlic juice to two parts inert liquid (oil, water, etc.). If irritation persists, further dilute the juice. Such problems can be avoided by infusing fresh cloves of garlic directly into olive oil. • If you wish to use garlic as a cancer- inhibiting antioxidant agent, immune- system enhancer, blood-thinning agent, cardiovascular tonic, or nutri- tional supplement, any form of garlic will probably have the desired results. Perhaps the only exceptions are preparations of garlic that have been subjected to heat such as pickled, sautéed, boiled, roasted, or otherwise hyperheated cloves that have likely been depleted of their medicinal potential and a considerable percent- age of their nutrients. Used properly and in the correct form, garlic is valuable for treatment of virtual- ly any form of internal or external bacte- rial, viral, or fungal infection, including parasites (such as tapeworms) and pro- tozoan organisms (such as Giardia). Fresh garlic or properly dried powder (from a reputable market source) can be fed as part of your animal’s diet to fight infections of the mouth, throat, respira- tory tract, stomach, or intestines. In sheep, goats, and cows, it is said to help alleviate mastitis. Freshly crushed garlic or fresh garlic juice can be infused or diluted into olive oil for use as a topical antiseptic for minor injuries, ear infec- tions, or mites. The rule here is to be sure the garlic is diluted sufficiently—the volatile oils are strong and can cause burning irritation if applied to the skin in concentrated form. Never apply essential oil of garlic to any part of the body; it’s too concentrated. And never use garlic preparations in the eyes. To use in topical applications, you don’t need much garlic—just enough to impart a mild garlic odor to the oil. To make a garlic oil, crush two or three cloves of garlic, wet them with vodka to help release the oils, and cover them with 4 ounces of olive oil. Shake the mixture vigorously and let it stand in the refriger- ator for an hour before using. The oil should have an obvious, but not over- powering, garlic odor. Within three to twenty-four hours, the allicin will begin dissipating from your oil, and its useful- ness for killing microbes will be dimin- ished. But don’t discard it. It still possess- es immune-supporting and disease- preventing qualities, and it can be added to your pet’s meals. Use 1⁄2 to 1 level tea- spoon per pound of food per feeding, Herbs for Pets 114 g Materia Medica 115 g depending on the oil’s strength. Keep your garlic oil in the refrigerator in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Expect it to keep for no more than a month. Contrary to what many believe, garlic will not act as its own preservative, and old garlic oil may develop botulism—a bacteria that can be deadly to animals and people. The added alcohol (vodka) is not enough to prevent botulism either, but adding 1⁄4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil to the garlic oil before it goes into the refrigerator will help extend its shelf life while adding a new element of nutritional support. As you can see, this justifies the task of mak- ing your own oil. Many commercially prepared oils produced from raw garlic offer no information on how long they will remain fresh and effective. Scientific studies have shown that var- ious compounds in garlic stimulate immune functions in the bloodstream at levels of activity that are unparalleled by any other herb (yes, even by echinacea). Perhaps most intriguing is garlic’s effect on the body’s natural killer cells—those cells that seek out and destroy cancer cells and invading microbes. In a study conducted with human subjects who have AIDS, garlic was found to increase killer cell activity threefold. Similar ani- mal studies have been conducted with similar results. Given the fact that these studies were done on subjects with depressed immune functions, it stands to reason that companion animals with healthy immune functions may benefit from the added measure of immune sup- port supplied through moderate garlic supplementation in their diets. A 1988 study found that diallyl sul- fide, a garlic constituent, prevented tumor formation in rats, and several other studies have shown that garlic inhibits various forms of cancerous growths in the body. This effect may be attributable to the liver-strengthening actions of at least six garlic components. In this capacity, garlic gently enhances overall liver function and triggers en- zyme responses to help break down waste materials before they go into the bloodstream. In other words, garlic helps the liver cleanse the body and thus helps prevent toxic accumulations that may lead to cancerous growths. Garlic also helps to lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, making it useful for miniature schnauzers, beagles, and other breeds that may be predisposed to hyperlipidemia—a condition that may lead to chronic seizures. Any form of uncooked garlic performs these func- tions, and its use is as simple as sprin- kling it onto an animal’s food. A once-a- day dosage of 1⁄8–1⁄4 teaspoon (powdered or freshly chopped) per pound of food fed is usually sufficient for most animals. We have seen very good results from the use of garlic against tapeworms. Used in powdered, fresh, or extract forms, garlic might not kill these persist- ent parasites, but it will make their living quarters much less desirable. Intestinal parasites don’t seem to like volatile oils or sulfur compounds, and if fed to an animal in correct dosages over a period of one to two months, garlic helps to drive these pests out. In our experiences with dogs, an increase in visible tape- worm segments in an animal’s stool is likely to occur after two to three weeks of daily garlic ingestion. After about two months, populations of these parasites are usually back to acceptable levels, or they may disappear completely. Garlic works in a similar fashion against protozoan infestations such as giardiasis, but in these cases a strong presence of allicin is needed to be effec- tive. Use fresh garlic and add Oregon grape root to your animal’s diet. This adds an antimicrobial “double punch” against these tough organisms. Garlic is one of the best all-around cardiovascular tonics in the plant world. In studies conducted in collaboration with the New York Department of Health, a component called ajoene found in both fresh and dried forms of garlic was found to be effective at pre- venting the formation of blood clots in the vascular system. In some provinces of France, racehorses suffering from blood clots are routinely fed garlic in their grain feed, and, as a result, the clots sometimes disappear in a matter of days. In fact, many researchers believe that garlic may be as useful as aspirin in this capacity, which makes it especially promising for use in cats since they cannot tolerate the salicylate con- stituents of aspirin. Garlic has also been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and the occurrence of atherosclerosis (fat buildup in the arteries) in both animals and humans, thus reducing the possibil- ity of stroke or heart attack. All of these attributes, combined with the immune- supportive, liver-strengthening capabili- ties of garlic, make this herb an excel- lent multisystem tonic for older ani- mals—especially dogs, who tolerate regular feeding of garlic better than cats do. Garlic’s effectiveness as a systemic flea or mosquito repellent is the subject of a great deal of debate among those who have tried it. Some people claim good results; others believe that the usefulness of garlic in this capacity is largely unfounded. Availability: Supermarkets and health food retailers Propagation and Harvest: Garlic is easy to grow. When sown in the fall, the plants thrive in even the harshest of winter climates, usually producing bulbs by late summer. A sandy loam with a slightly alkaline pH level is the best growing medium. In areas where winters are mild, the cloves can be pressed about 1 inch into the soil in late fall for an early summer crop. In north- ern climes, plant your cloves 4 inches deep as late as you can still work the soil in fall. Cover your planting with at least 6 inches of mulch. Expect to see sprouts shortly after the last hard frost. Garlic should be harvested in midsummer to late summer, after the tops of the plants have died back. Dig up the bulbs, then allow them to dry in the sun for two or three days before you store them in a cool, dry place indoors. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For topi- cal treatment of bacterial infections, con- sider Oregon grape, Saint-John’s-wort, bee balm, thyme, and chamomile as alternatives. For immune system and antioxidant support, investigate echi- nacea, astragalus, licorice, alfalfa, red clover, and burdock as adjuncts or alter- natives. For treating giardiasis and E. coli infections, garlic combines well with Oregon grape or organically raised goldenseal. Cautions and Comments: Toxic side effects from the consumption of garlic are rare in animals and humans alike, but the possibility of harming your dog, your cat, or your herbivore with garlic does exist, and there is a growing controversy about how much garlic is enough and how much is too much. At the root of this con- troversy is a dangerous misconception: the notion that more garlic is always bet- ter. Despite all of the grand attributes we have just described, moderation—the car- dinal rule of all herb use—applies strictly to garlic, particularly when it is used in cats. When misused (used excessively or over an extended period), garlic may cause Heinz-body anemia, a potentially Herbs for Pets 116 g Materia Medica 117 g life-threatening blood disease. Scientists theorize that two chemical compounds contained in garlic may be related to this disorder: s-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, or n- propyl disuldhide. These compounds are believed to deplete a naturally occurring glucose enzyme called Glucose-6-phos- phate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme has a special function of protect- ing the walls of red blood cells. Depletion of G6PD causes oxidative damage to the cells, thus forming Heinz bodies and trig- gering the body to reject them from the bloodstream (usually via dark-colored urine). If left unchecked, this process con- tinues until the numbers of red blood cells are lowered to the point that the animal becomes anemic and eventually dies. Fortunately, this nightmare is easily pre- vented with some common sense and a few precautions. Other side effects of garlic are more predictable and less threatening: digestive upset and gas when ingested (in which case, reduce the dose and relieve the gas with chamomile) or redness and irritation when applied to the skin (usually indica- tive of a preparation that is too concen- trated). First, it stands to reason that animals with preexisting anemic conditions should not receive garlic internally in any quanti- ty. Puppies don’t begin reproducing new red blood cells until after six to eight weeks of age. Until then, they need every red blood cell they are born with, so a diet that includes garlic is not appropriate for young puppies. It’s important to know that the possi- bility of Heinz-body anemia is dose dependent, meaning the more garlic fed, the greater the chances of a prob- lem developing. While we still don’t know exactly how much is too much, most recorded instances of Heinz-body anemia in animals involve the ingestion of large quantities of onions and other garlic relatives, many of which are likely to contain much larger percentages of enzyme-depleting constituents than a typical dose of garlic. Recorded cases of allium poisoning typically involve onion doses exceeding 0.5 percent of the sub- ject animals’ body weight—this means that a healthy 60-pound dog would have to eat a whole 5-ounce onion, or several cloves of garlic, just to start the Heinz- body process. And since red blood cells are regenerated quickly from the bone marrow, this grotesque overdose would probably have to be repeated several times on a frequent basis to cause per- manent harm. In further defense of gar- lic, several other foods can cause Heinz- body anemia as well—large amounts of turnips, kale, rape, or anything rich in vitamin K may lead to the disorder, espe- cially in herbivores. Small doses of garlic added to your companion animal’s food three or four days per week, perhaps 1⁄8 teaspoon of garlic powder per pound of food fed, are probably going to be of great benefit to the overall health of your pet. Just don’t overdo it. Cats are much more sensitive to the side effects of garlic than dogs are, so they require more caution and attention with its use. Watch for digestive upset and behavioral changes. And if your cat simply doesn’t want any garlic, don’t force the issue. Your cat’s behavior may be more than just a finicky attitude—animals know their needs better than we do. Remember to use common sense and moderation and to have respect for gar- lic as more than just a table condiment. No two animals are alike; one person’s miracle cure is another one’s poison. If you wish to use garlic in a therapeutic capacity, get to know your animal first, then consult a professional (or carefully read the label on your garlic product) before you proceed. GINKGO Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo Family Appearance: Characterized by its unique fan-shaped leaves, ginkgo is a slow-growing tree that may reach 100 feet in height. A healthy tree can live to be one thousand years old. Ginkgo is one of the oldest plant medicines on earth. In fact, it is one of the oldest species of trees still in existence. Habitat and Range: It is estimated that the Ginkgo genus once included several hundred varieties that spanned the globe for over two million years. Today, however, there is only one species, G. biloba, a native of China that has been introduced into North America and most of Europe and Asia for ornamental and medicinal purposes. Cycle and Bloom Season: Ginkgo is a deciduous tree that blooms in early spring, just as the leaves are beginning to develop into their fanlike shapes. Fruits (known as ginkgo nuts) develop and ripen by midsummer. The leaves turn yellow and begin falling in early to late fall. Parts Used: Although ginkgo nuts were used almost exclusively for thou- sands of years, the fall-harvested leaves are of primary interest to contemporary herbalists. Primary Medicinal Activities: Dilates blood vessels, anticoagulant, antioxi- dant, tonic Strongest Affinities: Brain, circulatory system, eyes Preparation: Tincture, tea, capsule Common Uses: Over four hundred sci- entific studies have been conducted to validate ginkgo’s effectiveness in both animals and humans. In fact, in Germany and other European countries, G. biloba extract (commonly known as GBE) is among the most frequently prescribed drugs of commerce. For a long time it was thought that almost all of ginkgo’s medicinal activity could be attributed to two groups of chemical constituents: flavone glycosides and terpene lactones. Dozens of human and animal studies have shown that these two groups of constituents act to improve blood circulation in small capil- laries, a trait that makes gingko espe- cially useful in the treatment of various forms of vascular deficiency—including the effects of old age. But current research indicates that these com- pounds represent only a small part of a complex array of interactive compo- nents. Specifically, ginkgo inhibits the platelet aggregation factor (PAF), the mechanism that causes slow-moving or obstructed blood to become “sticky” and begin forming into clots. Ginkgo does this especially well in small capillar- ies that are particularly susceptible to blockage and that serve tissues that are not reached by larger vessels such as areas of the brain, ears, and extremities. Ginkgo also helps regulate the tone and elasticity of blood vessels, making them stronger and less susceptible to degener- ative disease. These actions make ginkgo a first choice cerebrovascular tonic for older animals. Increased blood flow in capillary-rich tissues of the brain means that the brain is better fed and oxygenat- ed, which in turn can reduce the likeli- hood of stroke and may equate to a longer, higher-quality life for your pet. In fact, several studies have shown that the cerebrovascular activities of ginkgo may be beneficial in treating degenerative Herbs for Pets 118 g Materia Medica 119 g age-related cases of chronic depression or abnormal behavior. If the brain is not getting the blood it needs, mood and behavior will likely be affected—and Rover might start getting rather snippy in his old age. Most of the current hoopla surround- ing ginkgo is focused on its use in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, but its effec- tiveness as a vascular tonic in other parts of the body deserves equal considera- tion. Ginkgo works as an effective vascu- lar tonic throughout the body, especially in smaller, peripheral capillaries of the legs, ears, and rectum. This makes it use- ful in a wide variety of circumstances where circulation has been impaired by trauma, chronic or degenerative disease, or surgical intervention. By opening up and strengthening the structural integrity of small capillaries in impaired areas, gingko improves circulation and enables the body to heal itself more effectively, which is the primary goal of using herbal tonics. Ginkgo also has been used for hun- dreds of years as a tonic for weak kidney function. While relatively little research has been conducted to validate such use, ginkgo’s effectiveness in this capacity is likely attributable to the same vascular tonic activities since the kidney is a blood-dependent organ. In fact, its vul- nerability and demise in the event of diminished blood supply is second only to the brain. In recent months, we have heard from veterinarians and pet own- ers who have been using an herbal combination that includes ginkgo and hawthorn in the treatment of early-stage renal failure. The anecdotal reports claim a general improvement in kidney function. This makes sense because hawthorn acts to reduce blood pressure as it increases circulation within the larger arteries, while ginkgo serves to open and tonify the smaller vessels. In addition to its vascular actions, gink- go also works as a nervous system tonic in the brain. Although the mechanisms of its neurological activity are complex and still hold many mysteries, studies indicate that ginkgo somehow increases energy levels in the brain and stimulates the release of various neurotransmitters, many of which regulate constriction of important smooth-muscle tissues throughout the body—such as those of the heart, bladder, and uterus. The fact that ginkgo works to influence brain function in ways that are exclusive of its circulatory activities makes for a broad scope of therapeutic useful- ness. In many cases, urinary incontinence, seizures, various forms of neuralgia, skin problems, chronic digestive upset, cardiac arrhythmia, and behavioral disorders (to name just a few) may be the result of cere- brovascular or neurological dysfunction that might be relieved with the proper use of ginkgo. Ginkgo biloba Many studies suggest that GBEs have been standardized to contain at least 24 percent ginkgolides. In our opinion, however, excellent results can be obtained from any high-quality extract of the leaves. A typical dose for elderly animals or for those who exhibit early signs of cerebrovascular deficiency, kid- ney failure, or impaired circulation in the extremities is anywhere between 0.25 milliliters and 0.75 milliliters of the liquid extract, two or three times daily for each 50 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Exact dosage varies according to the specific circumstances of disease, size of the animal, potency of the extract, and duration of use. In other words, you are advised to seek a qualified holistic practi- tioner for a complete workup of your animal before proceeding with ginkgo therapy. Availability: Widely available through health food stores and herb retailers. Ginkgo trees are available through land- scape nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Ginkgo trees are not difficult to grow—all they need is room to spread their roots, a moderate climate (hardy in the southern two-thirds of North America), and some water from time to time. The problem is that they are slow growers, with yearly growth often measured in fractions of an inch. If you are lucky enough to have access to a mature ginkgo tree, however, take advantage of the fresh leaves, which are far superior to the dried leaves that are available at herb stores. Analysis of ginkgo leaves indicates that the broadest diversity of medicinal constituents is found when the leaves are just begin- ning to turn yellow (in the fall). Gather the leaves just as they are turning yellow, before they fall from the tree and in advance of any evidence of mold on the leaf surfaces. The leaves can then be used fresh to make tincture, or they can be dried for future use. The dried leaves keep for about one year. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Gingko combines well with hawthorn for car- diovascular or kidney disorders. For use as a general vascular tonic, ginkgo can be combined with garlic, cayenne, or yarrow. Cautions and Comments: By most standards, ginkgo is safe. But because of its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation in the blood, its use may be contraindi- cated in the presence of blood-thinning drugs or in animals with blood-clotting disorders. While ginkgo improves the body’s ability to heal after surgery, its use should be delayed until all risk of postop- erative hemorrhage has passed. GOLDENROD Solidago spp. Sunflower Family Appearance: Goldenrod is a common wayside weed that is easy to identify by its spire-shaped or triangular clusters of tiny bright goldenrod-yellow flowers. The leaves of the most common species are narrowly lance-shaped and may or may not have serrated edges. Plants are erect and range from 2 inches (Solidago multiradiata—mountain goldenrod) to 70 inches (S. canadensis; S. occidentalis; S. gigantea) in height. Most species share similar appearances. This is especially true of the larger species, which may dif- fer only in leaf texture or the presence of stem hairs. Habitat and Range: The Solidago ge- nus can be divided into two categories: those that grow in moist soils and those that prefer drier habitats. Generally Herbs for Pets 120 g Materia Medica 121 g speaking, most of the smaller mountain varieties are found in dry soils, often at the edges of forest roads or in open meadows. The larger varieties are com- mon to river and lake habitats, irrigated fields, drainage ditches, and so on, from below sea level to about 4,000 feet in elevation. Several species are widespread throughout North America, with S. canadensis (Canada goldenrod) being perhaps the most common. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennial, sometimes annual. Blooms throughout the summer months Parts Used: Entire flowering plant— roots and all Primary Medicinal Activities: Astrin- gent, tonic, diuretic, reduces inflammation of respiratory mucosa (anticatarrhal), strengthens kidney functions (nephritic), anti-inflammatory, helps prevent or elimi- nate urinary stones (antilithic), antibacteri- al, antifungal, stops bleeding Strongest Affinities: Respiratory tract, urinary tract, and kidneys Preparation: Dried herb, tincture, tea Common Uses: As with many common wayside weeds, goldenrod’s usefulness is usually overshadowed by that of other herbs that have greater mass-market appeal. This is unfortunate because while many people spend their hard-earned money on the latest herb sensation, a better alternative may be growing in profuse abundance just behind the house. Goldenrod is one such herb. It is extremely useful but far less marketable than many others simply because it is too abundant to give notice to. Goldenrod is an excellent antica- tarrhal, an herb that helps to reduce the production of mucus in the bronchi by decreasing inflammation of the mucous membranes. While the produc- tion of mucus is essential in the body’s holistic efforts to eliminate pathogens and waste products from the respirato- ry tract during bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, reducing the irritation of swollen membranes helps to comfort the sufferer while making the overall healing effort more productive. For dogs and cats, a teaspoon or two of a flower or leaf tea (made with a tea- spoon of the dried herb in 8 ounces of water, cooled to lukewarm) often brings quick relief for a persistent wet cough. Horses and other large herbi- vores can be fed a handful or two of the fresh herb for the same purpose. Although relatively little scientific research has been conducted into gold- enrod’s effectiveness as a kidney tonic, it has been used successfully in this Solidago canadensis capacity for hundreds of years. Spe- cifically, goldenrod is said to boost renal function quickly, making it espe- cially helpful for acute cases of nephri- tis, especially where anuresis (an inabil- ity to pass urine from the kidneys) is a prevalent symptom. Goldenrod can also be useful in preventing or assisting in the elimination of kidney stones. However, the activities of goldenrod may be contraindicated in advanced chronic cases of kidney disease, where stimulation of renal function may cause added stress to overworked kidneys. The various mechanisms and patholo- gies of kidney disease are difficult to assess accurately, and finding the cor- rect approach should be left to your holistic veterinarian. In topical applications, goldenrod has remarkable hemostatic qualities, espe- cially when the dried and powdered flowers are used. The powder can be applied liberally to stop bleeding and inhibit bacterial infection of minor cuts and abrasions. Goldenrod may moderate allergic reactions to airborne pollen and other allergens if taken for several weeks prior to the start of hay fever season. When a measured amount of golden- rod—a potentially allergenic plant—is introduced into the body just before hay fever season, the body begins building its antiallergen defenses before the real onslaught. Availability: Available through herb retailers; profusely abundant in vacant lots and forests throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Propagation and Harvest: Harvest the entire plant when it is in full bloom. The entire plant can then be chopped and made into a tincture, or it can be dried for later use in teas. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For upper respiratory infections, goldenrod com- bines especially well with echinacea and Oregon grape. Consider mullein, colts- foot, wild cherry, marshmallow, slippery elm, and grindelia as adjuncts or alterna- tives for coughs. Dandelion, couch grass, corn silk, ginkgo, uva ursi, marshmallow, echinacea, and hawthorn should be investigated for treating urinary and kid- ney disorders. Cautions and Comments: Goldenrod has no known toxicity but may be con- traindicated in animals with certain forms of kidney disease. Although gold- enrod is not as allergenic as once thought (often it is blamed for allergies caused by ragweed and other plants), it should be used with caution in animals who are predisposed to pollen allergies. GOLDENSEAL Hydrastis canadensis Buttercup Family Appearance: Goldenseal is a perennial that may grow to 12 inches in height. The main stem of the plant is typically forked to produce two nearly circular 2-inch to 6- inch-wide leaves, one of which is usually larger than the other. The leaves are deeply lobed, five to seven times, with toothed margins. The plant may require three or more years of growth before it blooms, then it produces a single whitish green flower that has no petals. In mid- summer, the flower develops into a single raspberry-like red fruit that contains ten to thirty small seeds. Stems are hairy. The horizontally creeping root is thick and woody. All parts of the root have deep goldenrod-yellow inner tissues. Habitat and Range: The range and population of this North American native are rapidly diminishing. The orig- Herbs for Pets 122 g Materia Medica 123 G inal range of goldenseal once included most of eastern North America—from Minnesota and Vermont south into Georgia. Today, most remaining stands of wild goldenseal are isolated in the central and northern reaches of the Appalachians and, to a lesser extent, the Ozark Mountains. Cycle and Bloom Season: A long-lived perennial that blooms in early spring Parts Used: Primarily the root; to a less- er extent the leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, reduces inflammation of respi- ratory mucosa, tonic, astringent, stimu- lates the liver, antiparasitic Strongest Affinities: Mucous mem- branes of the respiratory tract, lower uri- nary tract, gastrointestinal tract, mouth, and eyes. Preparation: Tincture, tea, or poultice Common Uses: Wild goldenseal is van- ishing because of greed, sensationalism, and misinformed use. The greatest mis- conception about goldenseal is that it acts as an herbal antibiotic in the body, coursing its way through the body sys- tems via the bloodstream to attack any pathogenic microbes in its path. This is untrue. Goldenseal does not act as an antibiotic. In fact, the antimicrobial alka- loids of this plant (namely berberine and hydrastine) act only to inhibit bacteria, fungi, parasites, and protozoan bodies that they come in direct contact with in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. These infection-fighting compounds are not absorbed into the bloodstream; they simply act as contact dis- infectants. With this in mind, goldenseal can be used against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella, and several others. As an anti-inflammatory, goldenseal is effective for ulcers and irritations of the mouth, upper respiratory tract, eyes, and, to a lesser degree, the digestive and uri- nary tracts. A poultice made from the powdered root can be applied directly to infections or ulcers in the mouth. Results are often seen within hours of application. For conjunctivitis that is secondary to bacterial or fungal infection in dogs, cats, birds, ferrets, rodents, horses, or reptiles, a goldenseal eyewash serves as a strong antimicrobial agent and also quickly reduces inflammation and red- ness. To use goldenseal in this capacity, make a strong tea from the chopped dry root, then add 12–20 drops of the dark golden-yellow fluid into 1 ounce of ster- ile saline solution—the liquid marketed for people with contact lenses. A few Hydrastis candadensis drops in each eye (or a fraction of a drop for small birds, rodents, and such) two or three times daily usually brings relief quickly. Internally, we like to use gold- enseal in conjunction with garlic for rid- ding our dogs and cats of tapeworms, and we have received good reports from veterinarians we work with who find this combination useful for treating giardiasis or E. coli infections in dogs, cats, and larg- er animals. Studies of the active compo- nent berberine substantiate these claims. Wild goldenseal is one of the most endangered wild medicinal plants in North America, and it is still being exploit- ed by the “bad apples” of the herb in- dustry. Fortunately, goldenseal can be replaced (in most cases) with Oregon grape root (Mahonia aquifolium), a natu- rally abundant member of the barberry family that also contains an impressive amount of the active constituent berber- ine. The continued survival of wild gold- enseal is totally dependent on human conscience and responsibility—if you think you need goldenseal, give Oregon grape a try first. Chances are you will be pleased with the results. If you still see a need for goldenseal, spend the extra money to buy goldenseal roots or gold- enseal preparations that have come from certified organic (cultivated) sources. If you use wildcrafted goldenseal, you are contributing to the rapid demise of a great healing treasure that can never be replaced. Availability: Herb retailers. Please buy goldenseal harvested from a cultivated source only. Propagation and Harvest: If you have a piece of ground that can support gold- enseal, grow some. The future success of this plant may depend on people like you. The best place to plant goldenseal is in the shade of a dense, hardwood canopy of a north-facing hillside. The plant re- quires deep compost-rich, well-drained soil with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5. With enough shade and the right soil amendments, goldenseal can be propa- gated in a garden as well. Goldenseal can be propagated from stratified seeds or from rhizomes spaced 4 inches apart in rows that are 12 inches apart. Planting should occur in fall. Goldenseal requires at least four to five years (preferably seven) to reach maturity. Alternatives and Adjuncts: In many applications where an antimicrobial or anticatarrhal is indicated, any number of plants that contain the yellow alkaloid berberine can be employed in place of goldenseal. Choices include Oregon grape (Mahonia sp.), twinleaf (Jeffersonia diphylla), or yerba mansa (Anemiopsis cali- fornica). Before any of these herbs are employed, however, a fundamental ques- tion of holistic responsibility should be addressed in the minds of all earth- conscious herb users: Does substituting a wildcrafted herb for an overharvested one benefit the future of wild medicinal plants, or does it simply defer impact onto another species? The fact that Oregon grape is an abundant wild substitute is beside the point. Humanity is efficient at disturbing or depleting virtually anything on earth, and when we elect to abandon one natural resource for another in the absence of proactive holistic thinking, we are only contributing to a continuum of human impact. With this in mind, we should elect to use wild substitutes only when cultivated goldenseal is not avail- able. Coptis sinensis, a species of goldthread that is widely cultivated in China, may also serve as an excellent sub- stitute for goldenseal. A small portion of goldthread or goldenseal added to echi- nacea serves as a direct-intervention “double-punch” for infections of the Herbs for Pets 124 g Materia Medica 125 g mouth, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract, while the echinacea does its job at boosting the immune system. Cautions and Comments: Some ani- mal studies have shown that berberine calms the uterus, but other studies show that it stimulates uterine contractions, so it is inadvisable to use goldenseal, Oregon grape, or other berberine-containing plant medicines in pregnant animals. Goldenseal lowers blood sugar, so don’t use it in animals who are hypoglycemic. Goldenseal also may alter the metabolism and may have the potential to cause hypertension. Long-term internal use of goldenseal may overstimulate the liver and trigger excessive production of bile— a situation that is likely to result in vomit- ing. Cats are especially prone to this side effect. In light of this, goldenseal should not be used continuously, in excess of seven days, without a break. For proper dose and duration of therapy, and to ascertain if internal use of goldenseal is indicated for your animal, consult a holis- tic veterinarian. An unpleasant but not really threaten- ing side effect may occur in cats that are fed goldenseal or any other plant that contains berberine: excessive salivation. Since first writing this book we have heard from several cat owners and vet- erinarians who report a “foaming at the mouth.” If this occurs, simply discontin- ue use—it simply means that this may not be the best herbal choice for your particular kitty. GOTU KOLA Centella asiatica Parsley Family Appearance: Gotu kola produces dark green, nearly circular, 1- to 3-inch leaves and purple flowers that are atypical of the parsley family. The leaves have long petioles (stems) and leathery smooth surfaces that give the plant an appear- ance similar to what lily pads would look like if they grew on land instead of in water. Habitat and Range: Gotu kola is a native of India, south Asia, eastern Europe, and the Philippines. It inhabits drainage ditches, streambeds, and moist waste areas, often in ground-covering abundance. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in summer Parts Used: Leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Active against various skin problems (antider- matitic), peripheral vasodilator, helps reduce arthritic inflammation, antioxi- dant, wound healing, diuretic Centella asiatica Strongest Affinities: Skin, nervous system, circulatory system Preparation: Tea or tincture or any variety of topical preparation such as salves, lotions, and poultices Common Uses: Gotu kola is especially useful for burns, skin injuries, or dermati- tis that involve vascular insufficiency or accumulation of subcutaneous swelling. When taken internally it increases peripheral blood circulation and serves as a mild diuretic, thus assisting with the body’s natural ability to cleanse and heal the epidermis. When applied externally, it serves as an antioxidant and speeds the healing process by stimulating regeneration of skin cells. It has also been shown to accelerate the production of healthy scar tissue after surgery. It is known to promote hair and nail growth. Gotu kola is useful in treating leprosy (mycobacteriosis), an ulcerous bacterial infection of the skin that can occur in dogs, cats, and other animals. In these cases, it is believed that a terpene com- pound called asiaticoside breaks down the protective waxy coating of the dis- ease-causing bacteria, leaving the invad- ing microbes vulnerable to the body’s immune system. Recent studies also sug- gest that the betulinic acid content of gotu kola is active against melanoma, a life-threatening form of skin cancer. Gotu kola is said to improve mental clarity and to act as a mild sedative and nervine (moderates nerve transmissions) in animals. In a study where rats were trained to do simple tasks, gotu kola was shown to improve learning and memory. Researchers correlated this finding to a deceleration of neurotransmitter repro- duction in the brain—in other words, memory was retained because the process of neurotransmission remained less interrupted. This makes gotu kola a potential candidate for treating senility in aging animals. Gotu kola may also be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. For animals with arthritis, gotu kola improves circulation in the legs and helps to reduce inflammation. It has also been shown to promote healing and reconstruction of connective tissue in the joints. For external applications, gotu kola can be used as a skin rinse, poultice, or fomentation. Salves and oil infusions work well too, especially when vitamin E oil is added. For internal uses in a dog or cat, a tea from the dried leaves (1 teaspoon of herb to 8 ounces of near- boiling water) can be fed directly or put in the animal’s food. Feed 1 table- spoon of the cooled tea per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight, once daily. Alternatively, a tablespoon of the fresh leaves can be finely chopped and added to each pound of an animal’s food (the young light-green leaves are delicious in salads). Horses can be fed a handful of the leaves each day as a dietary adjunct. A low-alcohol tincture is yet another option. For each 30 pounds of a dog’s body weight, add 0.5–1 milliliter of tincture to food daily. Add 0.5 milliliters of tincture to your cat’s food daily. Availability: Herb retailers and a few specialty seed and plant suppliers Propagation and Harvest: Although gotu kola is seldom grown in North America, its cultivation is certainly possi- ble. The plants must be kept warm—at tropical temperatures—throughout their lives, meaning that they will need a greenhouse or a consistently warm, sun- lit place indoors in order to flourish in most of North America. The plants like nitrogen-rich soil, a mix of shade and sunlight, and room to spread. Herbs for Pets 126 g Materia Medica 127 g Alternatives and Adjuncts: For exter- nal treatment of skin problems, consider calendula, chaparral, aloe, comfrey, and chamomile as alternatives or adjuncts. For internal treatment of skin problems or arthritis, gotu kola combines with alternatives such as burdock, red clover, or yellow dock. Diuretic, nutritive, and cholagogue herbs such as dandelion leaf and root, Oregon grape, cleavers, and nettle should be considered as well. Licorice, devil’s claw, or yucca root serves as anti-inflammatory adjuncts. For vascu- lar problems, gotu kola combines with ginger, cayenne, peppermint, ginkgo, yarrow, or hawthorn. To improve mental clarity and circulation in the brain, add ginkgo to your gotu kola. Cautions and Comments: Although never witnessed by the authors or any- one we consult with, there is some scien- tific literature that presents the theory that excessive doses of gotu kola may have narcotic effects in animals, may cause photosensitivity, and may interfere with hypoglycemic therapies. Large doses may also present abortifacient activities and therefore should not be used in pregnant animals. GRAVELROOT Eupatorium purpureum Sunflower Family Appearance: Gravelroot is a large perennial, sometimes reaching 12 feet tall. The lance-shaped leaves have short petioles and grow directly off of the main stem in whorls of four or more. Leaves are distinctively textured and have coarsely serrated edges. Stems are smooth, succulent, and covered with purple spots, especially at the leaf axils. Flowers are small and pink, presented in showy slightly globe-shaped clusters at the top of the plant. Spotted gravelroot (Eupatorium maculatum) shares the habi- tat of and looks similar to E. purpureum, except the mature plants tend to be much smaller. Both are equally useful. Boneset (E. perfoliatum), a close rela- tive of gravelroot, is a proportionately smaller plant that offers a different range of therapeutic usefulness. Habitat and Range: Gravelroot is common at the edges of moist forest clearings, where it often forms dense thickets. Its range includes most of the eastern United States from Minnesota and Nebraska eastward to the Atlantic Ocean and south to Florida. In the West, E. maculatum is sporadically distributed from South British Columbia to New Mexico. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in midsummer Eupatorium purpureum Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic, anti-inflammatory, tonic, helps reduce arthritic inflammation, helps prevent or eliminate urinary stress Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract Preparation: Decoction or tincture of the root Common Uses: Gravelroot is traditionally used for expelling small kidney and blad- der stones (gravel) from the urinary tract. It is effective for reducing the pain and inflammation of cystitis, and is sometimes used to treat swollen prostates. The diuret- ic activities of gravelroot may help in the elimination of excess uric acid from the body, making it potentially useful in the treatment of gout and other forms of rheumatism. Although little scientific vali- dation exists for the medicinal uses of this plant, its abundance and long-standing reputation among herbalists as a safe and effective urinary tract remedy warrants attention. While this herb has been safely used in dogs and cats, we cannot recom- mend gravelroot as a first-choice herb sim- ply because we don’t know it as well as its alternatives. However, gravelroot is a pro- fusely abundant plant in many areas of North America, and it is a valuable resource when other urinary tract herbs may not be available. It is also a plant that is likely to gain market popularity in coming years, and chances are it will someday enter the market in some kind of pet formula. In any case, gravelroot is a good herb to remem- ber as an emergency standby resource. Availability: Despite its long history as an herbal medicine, commercial sources of gravelroot are difficult to find in many parts of North America, especially in the West. The solution to this problem is simple— grow your own! Seeds are available through specialty catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: This peren- nial is easy to grow. It sends up shoots from its rhizomes shortly after it is planted and forms a self-sufficient thicket. All it really needs is plenty of sun, rich soil, and frequent watering. Plants do best if shel- tered from wind because the stems tend to break easily. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For removal of gravel from the urinary tract, gravelroot is often combined with demulcent herbs such as marshmallow root, plantain, and corn silk. In urinary disorders that also involve inflammation or bleeding, gravel- root can be combined with stronger astrin- gents or other anti-inflammatory herbs such as uva ursi, cleavers, and corn silk. As an alternative, consider couch grass. Cautions and Comments: Only the root of this plant should be used because the leaves, stems, and flowers contain echina- tine, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid that may be harmful to the liver if consumed in large enough quantities. Although direct side effects appear to be rare in animals who eat this plant, raw milk taken from animals who have grazed on gravelroot and then fed to humans and other animals may have toxic effects. The symptoms of over- dose may include weakness, nausea, vom- iting, liver damage, tremors, collapse, diffi- cult breathing, convulsions, coma, or death. It is highly advisable to contact a veterinarian familiar with gravelroot before administering it to your dog or cat. GRINDELIA Grindelia squarrosa Sunflower Family Appearance: When grindelia is first encountered in the field, two thoughts Herbs for Pets 128 g Materia Medica 129 g often come to mind: This is a weed, and this is obviously a member of the sun- flower family. Grindelia has strong but flexible 1- to 3-foot-tall stems, saw- toothed leaves, and bright yellow flow- ers that grow one per stem. Beneath the yellow rays, the flowers have distinctive curved bracts. The flower heads have a sticky gumlike substance that has earned the plant the common name of “gum- weed.” Habitat and Range: Several species of Grindelia range throughout the western two-thirds of North America. All share similar appearances and most are inhab- itants of wide-open plains or dry, sunny forest clearings. Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial or short-lived perennial that reproduces by seed Parts Used: Flowers and leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Ex- pectorant, sedative, cough suppressant, anti-inflammatory, lowers blood pres- sure, relieves poison ivy–induced con- tact dermatitis Strongest Affinities: Respiratory tract and skin Preparation: For internal uses: tincture or tea. For contact dermatitis: tea (skin rinse), salve, lotion, ointment, or lini- ment (an externally applied tincture). Common Uses: Very little scientific attention has been directed toward grindelia, but its effectiveness and useful- ness as a respiratory herb is well known among Western herbalists. Native Americans, who passed their herbal wis- dom to us, used grindelia to treat every- thing from tuberculosis and pneumonia to gonorrhea and postpartum pain. From a scientific perspective, we know that the gummy substance secreted from the flower heads contains at least 20 percent resins, which are composed of substances that stimulate mucus secretion and reduce inflammation in the upper respira- tory tract, making a dry, hacking cough more productive. Adding to grindelia’s expectorant qualities are sedative and antispasmodic activities that calm a spas- tic cough by relaxing the smooth muscles of the upper respiratory tract while dilat- ing the bronchioles. This makes grindelia useful for relieving the symptoms of asth- ma in dogs and cats, especially when it is administered at the early onset of an attack. We also find it useful for easing the symptoms of bordetella (kennel cough). To evaluate whether grindelia is appropri- ate for your pet and to determine a prop- er dosage, talk to a holistic practitioner. Grindelia squarrosa Many North American Indian tribes used decoctions or simple teas of grindelia leaves and flowers as a sooth- ing skin rinse for poison ivy–induced der- matitis, and in recent years, grindelia lotions have started to appear in European markets for the same purpose. A simple homemade decoction or tinc- ture serves this purpose—apply as need- ed to the affected areas once or twice daily. Availability: Grindelia herb or herbal preparations are available through herb retailers. The seed is available through specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Grindelia tolerates poor soil and can be propagat- ed easily from seed. Harvest the flowers and leaves when the plants are in full bloom. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For asth- ma, a small amount of grindelia can be combined with nettle. Look at lobelia as a possible adjunct or alternative. For ken- nel cough and other respiratory infec- tions and irritations, check out hore- hound, coltsfoot, comfrey, mullein, and wild cherry as possible alternatives or adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Internal use of grindelia may have a relaxing effect on the heart muscle and may cause a decrease in blood pressure. As a result, grindelia may be contraindicated in ani- mals with heart or other circulatory problems. Excessive doses of grindelia are believed to cause renal irritation; therefore grindelia may be contraindicat- ed in animals with renal failure or other forms of kidney disease. Although it is generally regarded as nontoxic but unpalatable to livestock and other ani- mals, little research has been done on the effects of grindelia. Its use should be limited to what the holistic pet care com- munity has learned through clinical experience. See your holistic veterinarian before administering this herb internally. Barring allergic sensitivity, external appli- cations are generally safe for home treat- ment of poison ivy dermatitis on most animals. HAWTHORN Crataegus sp. Rose Family Appearance: Hawthorn is a small deciduous tree or large shrub (up to 16 feet tall) that is easily recognized and quickly remembered by its nasty 1- to 3- inch curved thorns that are strategically spaced along the branches, often at eye level. The leaves of most species are nar- rowly fan-shaped or oval. The margins of the 1- to 2-inch-long leaves are toothed with all leaf tips pointing distinctly for- ward. The white 1⁄4-inch flowers are pre- sented in flat clusters, each blossom hav- ing five petals and numerous stamens (the pollen-bearing structures). When in full bloom, the blossoms often have an unpleasant “dead” odor. In late summer, the flowers are replaced with clusters of red to black berries that contain two to five seeds each. Habitat and Range: The Crataegus genus is large and varied with hundreds of species (all of which readily hybridize) in North America. Most species are found in riparian thickets or moist mead- ows, where they serve as important for- age and nesting habitats for birds and other wildlife. They are found in Alaska and British Columbia southward into California and are widely distributed eastward throughout the western interi- or states at valley and foothill elevations. C. douglasii (black hawthorn, see photo) Herbs for Pets 130 h Materia Medica 131 h is one of the most common and wide- spread species. Cycle and Bloom Season: Deciduous perennial; blooms sometime between April and June Parts Used: Fruits (berries) or flowers and leaf buds Primary Medicinal Activities: Tonic (strengthens cardiovascular structures and functions), lowers blood pressure, dilates blood vessels, nutritive, antioxi- dant Strongest Affinities: Cardiovascular system Preparation: Fresh or dried berries, tincture, tea, and decoction Common Uses: Hawthorn berries have been considered one of nature’s best and safest heart and vascular tonics for mil- lennia. A great deal of scientific study has validated hawthorn’s usefulness in this capacity, and herbalists and researchers agree that hawthorn benefits the heart and arteries in at least three ways: • Hawthorn dilates both coronary vessels and vessels of the brain, helping to increase circulation and the transport of nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. It accomplishes this in an effective and unique fashion: while it dilates major vessels, it also increases blood flow from the heart to compen- sate for any reduction of arterial blood volume. In other words, it helps the body push more blood around by increasing cardiac output and decreas- ing blood flow resistance in the arter- ies so there is more blood flow at lower pressure. This effect has been shown in studies performed with dogs, especially when used in small doses over an extended period. • Hawthorn possesses antioxidant prop- erties. It scavenges free-radical mole- cules that are known to rob the blood of oxygen and may lead to various forms of vascular disease. • Hawthorn acts to steady and strength- en a weak or erratic heartbeat. In fact, it has been shown to be a possible alternative to the drug digitalis and may actually serve as a potentiating adjunct to this cardiac drug. All of these activities are largely attribut- able to the vast array of flavonoid con- stituents held in hawthorn. Flavonoids are typified as red pigments found in many kinds of fruits and vegetables, and hundreds of studies have indicated that these compounds are essential in maintaining disease resistance and the Crataegus douglassi integrity of smooth-muscle tissues throughout the body. It so happens that hawthorn may be the richest natural source of these vital nutrients. In a recent study using unfortunate rats, the flavonoid constituents held in hawthorn were shown to help prevent myocardial damage in situations where the heart muscle was subjected to physiological stress. This means that animals such as racehorses and working dogs, who are constantly under cardiovascular stress, are likely to find preventative benefits from daily supplements of hawthorn berries in their diets. It stands to reason that this cardiovascular tonic is useful in the daily care of older animals, especially those who suffer from chronic heart problems such as congestive heart fail- ure, postsurgical dysfunction, or cardiac anomalies that have resulted from heart- worm, bacterial or viral infections, or protracted chemotherapy. When com- bined with herbs that strengthen kidney function, hawthorn may also serve as a good adjunct therapy in the early treat- ment of kidney failure. Hawthorn’s vasodilator and hypotensive actions may help to improve blood circulation through the renal arteries and smaller vessels of the kidneys without the added stress of increased blood pressure. One of the nicest things about using hawthorn in treating animals is the fact that it tastes pretty good and is one of the easiest herbs to feed to your pet. If you are lucky enough to have a hawthorn tree near your home and an animal who likes red fruit, you can pick the ripe berries and feed them as tonic treats. As an alternative, the fully ripe berries can be picked, dried on a clean sheet of paper, and ground by hand with a mortar and pestle (be forewarned: the dried berries burn out small coffee grinders) into a coarse powder. The pow- der can then be added to your pet’s diet—1 teaspoon per pound of food fed each day. If your animal won’t eat the berries either way, try making a tea and pouring it over the food. If that doesn’t work, you can use hawthorn gel capsules wrapped with a little cheese, or, better yet, you can use a low-alcohol hawthorn extract. The berries are the commonly used and marketed part of the hawthorn plant, probably because they make such a pretty and palatable medicine. But in early spring, before the berries are avail- able, the flowering branch ends (leaves, flower buds, twigs, and thorns) can be clipped into small pieces and made into a decoction. Good luck getting it into your animal though—unlike the berries, the “twig tea” tastes awful! Availability: Hawthorn berries and the dried leaves and flowers are available through herb retailers. Various hawthorn preparations are available at health food stores. Propagation and Harvest: A few species of hawthorn are available through nurseries, particularly those spe- cializing in native plants. Hawthorn is not difficult to grow—all it really requires is plenty of water. But it tends to be a slow grower. Gather the berries when they are completely ripe, usually in mid- summer. Depending on the species, the berries are red or blue-red (almost black in the case of C. douglasii). The berries can then be used fresh, or they can be dried for future use. When properly stored, they should keep for at least a year. The flowering end-twigs should be harvested and used as soon as the blos- soms open in early spring. Alternatives and Adjuncts: When combined with a good natural diet and other tonic herbs, hawthorn acts exactly Herbs for Pets 132 h Materia Medica 133 h as an herbal heart tonic should, filling the special cardiac needs in the golden years of an animal’s life. Other tonic herbs can be used in combination with hawthorn to round out the supplemen- tal needs of older animals. These might include ginkgo or yarrow (for strength- ening capillary walls), garlic (for added antioxidant and immune system sup- port), alfalfa and red clover (to nourish the blood, increase appetite, and raise energy levels), dandelion leaf (to assist in the removal of excess water and lend tonic support to the kidneys), and oat- straw (as a nervous system tonic). Cautions and Comments: Hawthorn is safe. In fact, in the hundreds of animal studies that have been conducted with this herb since 1900, hawthorn has shown extremely low toxicity in every animal tested. We place the toxicity potential of hawthorn berries on the same level as that of rose hips, raspber- ries, or blueberries—in other words, hawthorn is a medicinal food. HOP Humulus lupulus Mulberry Family Appearance: Hop is a beautiful trailing vine with deeply lobed leaves reminis- cent of those of grapevines. Habitat and Range: Originally a Eurasian plant, several varieties of hop are grown throughout the world. Many have escaped cultivation and now adorn waste areas, railway easements, and ravines throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in mid– to late summer. Parts Used: Strobiles (strobili), com- monly known as hops Primary Medicinal Activities: Seda- tive, diuretic, stimulates digestion Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, urinary tract, digestive tract Preparation: Tea, tincture, fresh stro- biles Common Uses: Unlike many of the calming herbs we refer to as herbal seda- tives, hop is truly sedative in nature. It works as a mild but reliable nervous sys- tem depressant and hypnotic, whereas most other calming herbs work more as muscle relaxants. Provided it is used with prudence and respect, hop serves as an excellent general-purpose calming agent in cases of acute anxiety such as the dreaded trip to the groomer or a long horse-trailer ride on the interstate. Provided the animals accept the bitter flavor, a handful or two of the fresh or Humulus lupulus dried strobiles can be fed to horses, lla- mas, mules, or other herbivores just before or during an emotional crisis. A few drops of the tea or tincture can be fed to dogs and cats. Hop is also good for separation anxi- ety and for episodes of hyperexcitability that occur subsequent to traumatic events such as intermittent episodes of insomnia, whining, and restlessness that haunt an adopted pet who is recovering from physical or emotional abuse. Giving 10–20 drops added to each quart of the animal’s drinking water usually serves this purpose well. Hop is also good for helping an animal to relax in the pres- ence of physical pain, especially when hop is combined with valerian. While hop does not lend appreciable painkilling activities, it does assist the animal in dealing with pain naturally. (Animals are much better at this than we are.) Giving 1⁄8 teaspoon for each 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, no more than three times daily, usually suffices for pain or acute anxiety problems. While hop may help to relieve the severity of pain or an emotional crisis, it is important to remember that it cannot treat the underlying causes of behavioral disorders. Hyperactivity and excitability may be symptoms of a nutritional defi- ciency, a metabolic imbalance, an infec- tion, or hyperthyroidism. Look deep into your animal’s crisis from as many per- spectives as you can. Even if hop seems to be solving the problem, it may be only masking the symptoms of a serious disease. Animal studies have confirmed that the humulone and lupulone con- stituents in hop are active against many forms of gram-positive bacteria as well as some of the troublesome fungi, including Candida spp. Human studies have also shown promising results from the use of hop in treating gallbladder inflammation and urinary incontinence. In the incontinence study, 772 of 915 human patients who received a formula containing hop, uva ursi, and vitamin E experienced excellent results. Availability: Dried hop is available through herb retailers or wherever beer- making supplies are sold. Avoid the com- pressed pellets or strobiles and the con- centrated hop syrups used for brewing. What you want is the whole dried stro- biles. The compressed pellets and syrups are concentrated and may cause a serious toxic reaction in your animal. Ideally, of course, you should grow your own hop. Propagation and Harvest: Hop vines are easy to grow, cold hardy, and attrac- tive when trained to climb a trellis or gar- den archway. The plants need moist, rich soil and full sun in order to thrive and bloom. Plants and root cuttings are avail- able through nurseries. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For pain and posttraumatic irritability, hop com- bines especially well with valerian. If the pain is attributable to nerve trauma or dysfunction, consider skullcap, oatstraw, or Saint-John’s-wort as possible adjuncts or alternatives. For anxiety and restless- ness characterized by trembling or hyperexcitability to touch or a sudden sound (the animal jumps when sur- prised), hop can be combined with skull- cap or passionflower. Cautions and Comments: In 1998, the National Animal Poison Control Center had recorded eight instances of dogs dying after eating hops that had been used and discarded during the process of brewing beer. All of these dogs succumbed to malignant hyper- thermia—an acute, uncontrollable fever the first symptom of which is heavy Herbs for Pets 134 h Materia Medica 135 h panting, followed by rapid heartbeat and a rapid and continued rise in body temperature. Seven of the dogs were greyhounds, and it appears that this breed is especially susceptible to hyper- thermia from eating discarded hops. It also should be noted that the deaths of these dogs were from the ingestion of the spent (postbrewing) hops used in making beer, not from the medicinal- quality hops used in making tinctures. The problem appears to stem from three common denominators: • The chemistry of spent hops or the manner by which they are metabo- lized by greyhounds may be quite dif- ferent from the manner in which fresh or dried strobiles are processed by the same animals. It is evident that the chemical and biochemical rela- tionships among hops, malt syrup, various sugars, and other elements of beer-making may be responsible for the ultimate results and should be investigated. Heat raises yet another question—the process of boiling the herb is likely to change the chemistry of hop and the entire beer-making combination. • The hops used may have been com- pressed and therefore would have been concentrated. • Although we still do not know why, it appears that greyhounds are especial- ly predisposed to this problem, and therefore they should never be fed hops. In light of this problem, a subsequent study was conducted and published in The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. The study found that all of the greyhounds examined in an emergency clinic for the disorder had ingested approximately 250 milliliters of spent hops each—that’s about one cup. Spent brewing hops are sweet and tasty, making them a target for gluttony and toxic excess. Despite the fact that there have been no additional reports of hops- related hyperthermia in dogs ten years later, caution dictates that it is best to limit your dogs’ access to spent home- brew hops, especially if your pet is a greyhound. Limit your use of hops to small quantities of a high-quality formu- lation designed for animals, or use unadulterated fresh or dried hops with moderation. HORSETAIL Equisetum arvense Horsetail Family Appearance: The horsetail family is generally divided into three groups: (1) annual varieties that produce separate and distinctly different fertile and sterile stems, (2) annuals that produce sterile and fertile stems that are similar in appearance, and (3) evergreen perenni- als that produce fertile and sterile stems that are alike. Despite these variances, the entire family shares fundamentally similar characteristics: hollow, distinc- tively grooved and jointed stems and dark, scalelike leaves that appear as sheaths surrounding the stems at the joints. In early spring, Equisetum arvense produces a small 3- to 12-inch fertile stem that lacks chlorophyll (the con- stituent that makes plants green). This stem dies back as its larger green, sterile counterpart matures. The subsequent, 6- inch to 2-foot-tall sterile stems have whorled branches that resemble green bottlebrushes. Equisetum hyemale is much larger (up to 5 feet tall) and lacks any branching characteristics. It looks like a prehistoric cross between minia- ture bamboo and an asparagus spear. Both species are often seen growing side by side. Habitat and Range: Lakeshores, stream banks, and other wet areas, up into alpine elevations throughout North America. Horsetails often represent the primary ground cover in shady wet thickets. Cycle and Bloom Season: The green sterile plants emerge in spring. Perennial varieties remain green and usable throughout the year; annual varieties die back in late fall. Parts Used: All aerial parts Primary Medicinal Activities: Diu- retic, astringent, stops bleeding, tonic Strongest Affinities: Musculoskeletal system, skin, and hair Preparation: Tincture or decoction for internal uses; a poultice for external compresses Common Uses: Horsetail contains a vast array of synergistic chemical com- pounds that all contribute to myriad medicinal uses, but most notable is its usefulness in healing bone and connec- tive tissue injuries. Most of horsetail’s regenerative actions in the musculoskeletal system can be attributed to its remarkable con- tent of bioactive silicon. In the body, sili- con is a fundamental starting point, or matrix, for the formation of bone, carti- lage, skin, and other connective tissues, including those of the aorta and trachea. Silicon is perhaps the most common ele- ment on earth. In fact, most of the sand on our planet is composed largely of sili- con but not in a form that can be absorbed and used by the body. The sil- icon contained in horsetail is unique in that it is in a form that can be metabo- lized for tissue repair and development. For you and your companion, horse- tail can help speed recovery from joint and bone injuries, including postsurgical trauma. For internal use, a decoction or tincture preparation is needed. Horsetail is poorly water soluble and is abrasive, so unless it is put into a form that the body can easily absorb, it may cause irritation to the urinary tract and kidneys. To make a decoction, take a large handful of the dried herb and place it into a nonmetallic cooking vessel (to avoid picking up metallic residues). Add a 1⁄2 tea- spoon of sugar and enough water to barely cover the herb. The sugar helps to extract the silicon constituents and makes a more palatable finished product. Simmer the mixture over low heat for about twenty minutes or until the water has turned dark green. Strain through a fine cloth and allow to cool. The clarified decoction can be added directly to your companion’s food—1 tablespoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight daily, five days a week. Horsetail tincture can be used the same way but at a smaller dosage of 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of body weight. Horsetail is also useful for a variety of urinary tract problems, particularly those that involve bleeding or an accumulation of superfluous tissue in the urinary tract. The hemolytic and antimicrobial proper- ties of horsetail make it beneficial for uri- nary tract infections that involve minor bleeding from the bladder or urethra. To help avoid urinary tract irritation during long-term use (more than ten days), it’s a good idea to use horsetail in conjunc- tion with soothing, protecting, and lubri- cating herbs such as marshmallow, plan- tain, or chickweed. Marshmallow is our first choice because it adds excellent antimicrobial properties to the therapeu- tic effort. There is evidence to support claims that horsetail may help prevent bone Herbs for Pets 136 h Materia Medica 137 h degeneration, skin and coat disorders, and even senility in older animals. Scientific studies have concluded that as a body ages, silicon levels in the circulatory system and skin decrease, which in turn leads to tissue degeneration and a dimin- ished capacity to form new tissue. Other studies suggest that horsetail may be use- ful in preventing certain forms of senility and degenerative bone disease, namely those directly related to the balance between silicon and aluminum in the body. In theory, these ailments may result from a toxic excess of aluminum, a condi- tion normally counteracted by the pres- ence of silicic acid, silicon, and other vital compounds that are contained in horse- tail. In other words, dietary supplementa- tion with horsetail may help maintain a healthful balance of silicon in the bodies of aging animals. See your holistic veteri- narian to ascertain if and how much horsetail is suitable for your companion. Availability: A common plant through- out most of the world. The dried herb and tincture are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: For medi- cine of optimum quality, harvest E. arvense in mid– to late spring while the leaves of the bottlebrush-like plant still point skyward. Later, as the leaves spread horizontally, they become less water sol- uble and therefore do not make as good a medicine. Clip the plants just above ground level, and spread them out on a piece of newspaper to dry thoroughly before use. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Combines well with marshmallow, cleavers, plantain, chickweed, corn silk, or couch grass for urinary tract problems. To help in the healing of bone and connective tissue injuries, horsetail tincture combines well with comfrey or nettle and serves as an excellent adjunct to glucosamine and chondroiton sulfate supplements. For nervous system support in older animals, horsetail serves as an excellent adjunct to hawthorn and ginkgo. Cautions and Comments: Do not use horsetail in cases of hypertension or car- diac disease. Horsetail may cause breast milk to change flavor during lactation. If there is a history of silicate stones of the urinary system, caution should be used. Do not gather this plant from areas that are downstream of commercial farming activities as it may contain inorganic nitrates that are metabolized into abnor- mal nicotine-like alkaloids. Livestock have reportedly been poisoned by eating large quantities of horsetail, possibly due to alkaloid interfering with either the production or use of vitamin B1. Equisetum arvense JUNIPER Juniperus spp. Cypress Family Appearance: There are over 130 species of juniper worldwide; about 26 of these species are native to North America. The berries of all are useful, but Juniperus com- munis (common juniper) has a reputation among herbalists and wild food epicure- ans as having the berries with the strongest medicine. Species of this large genus of ever- greens are differentiated by their size (trees or low-growing shrubs) and the specific characteristics of their leaves (needlelike or scalelike). All junipers can be easily identified by their foliage and cones (commonly called juniper berries), which have a strong and distinctive gin- like aroma. Habitat and Range: Common juniper is generally a mountain shrub that can be found on rocky hillsides and forest clearings up to about 10,000 feet in ele- vation. Juniper is widespread from Alaska to California and throughout much of temperate North America. The afore- mentioned tree varieties are high-desert dwellers of eastern California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico. Cycle and Bloom Season: Evergreen, producing fruits that take two to three years to ripen Parts Used: Fruits (berries) and leaves (often called needles) Primary Medicinal Activities: Astrin- gent, diuretic, antimicrobial, strengthens kidney function, lowers blood sugar, tonic Strongest Affinities: Genitourinary system (including the kidneys), skin Preparation: Decoction of the leaves or berries, tincture (berries), or whole (dried or fresh) berries can be fed direct- ly or as a food additive. Common Uses: Recent scientific studies conducted at the College of Medicine at Taiwan National University and the Universidad de Granada in Spain have shown that juniper offers new hope in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovas- cular disease. In the study conducted in Spain, a decoction of ripe juniper berries was administered to both diabetic and healthy rats. In both test groups, the decoction was found to lower blood glu- cose levels by increasing glucose uptake in the diaphragm, while at the same time increasing the amount of insulin released from the pancreas. The result was a lower mortality rate in animals with insulin-dependent diabetes and new hope for those with other forms of diabetes. In the study conducted in Taiwan, a compound derivative of the berries called 14 acetoxycedrol was found to have anticoagulant effects in the blood and a relaxing action on vas- cular tissues, actions that should prove useful in reducing the risk of cardiovas- cular disease in humans and other ani- mals. In the minds of modern herbalists, these wonderful new discoveries only add to juniper’s long history as a heal- ing ally. During the black plague, many European physicians carried three or four juniper berries in their mouth at all times to prevent infection. Medical instruments were soaked in a disinfect- ing decoction of the berries. Native Americans used every part of the shrub for a variety of ailments ranging from sore throats to dandruff, sometimes bathing their horses in a root tea to improve their coats. In fact, juniper has been used as a food and medicine for Herbs for Pets 138 j Materia Medica 139 j thousands of years by cultures the world over and remains an ingredient in sever- al mainstream over-the-counter diuretic and laxative remedies today. The berries are a valuable culinary commodity as well, being used as the primary flavoring agent in gin and as a rather expensive seasoning for gourmet dishes. (We like to use them in place of bay leaves in chili and wild-food dishes.) Modern-day herbalists use juniper to treat edema and arthritis as well as acute and severe cystitis and other infections of the urinary tract. Juniper is also known to stimulate kidney function by increasing the rate of glomerulus filtration, the process by which the kidneys filter out impurities and cleanse the blood. In lay terms, juniper increases urine production and waste elimination. This effect is due to an irritant action attributable to juniper’s generous content of volatile oils, especially one called terpineol. Because of these irritating effects, juniper should never be used in animals with preexisting kidney problems, nor should it be used over long periods of time. Also, juniper is known to have a vasodi- lating action in the uterus and was once used to promote menstrual flow; there- fore, it should never be used in pregnant animals. Fortunately, all of this sounds more ominous than it really is since many stimulatory herbs work because of their abilities to selectively irritate the body. When used over a very short peri- od in the correct dosages, and in non- pregnant animals with healthy kidneys, juniper can safely increase renal circula- tion and boost overall kidney function. The antiseptic and astringent proper- ties of the berries or leaves may be useful in relieving itchiness and infections of the skin when applied topically in the form of a cooled dilute rinse. Because the plant is not water soluble, you will first need to make a simple decoction (see chapter 1). After the decoction has cooled, dilute it with enough cold water to give it the appearance of a weak tea (you should be able to see through a clear 8-ounce glass of the liquid. Now you can pour the liquid over your dog (and as long as you don’t mind a few claw scratches, your cat) until the animal is thoroughly soaked. Avoid getting any into your animal’s eyes. Before using juniper in a rinse, be sure that the decoction is well diluted. While problems seldom occur when using juniper as a skin rinse, the volatile oils in the plant can be irritating if the solution is too strong, especially if your animal has sensitive skin to start with. (By the way, this applies to peppermint, penny- royal, and eucalyptus rinses as well.) After you rinse your pet, she will smell like a conifer forest on a warm spring day! Juniperis communis Availability: Juniper berries are avail- able at the supermarket, but they are much too expensive considering how common the shrubs are. Juniper leaf and berry extracts are available through herb retailers. Several shrub and small tree varieties are available from nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Several species of juniper have been domesticat- ed and are available at your local nursery. Juniperus communis is frequently used as a low-growing landscaping shrub and is an excellent choice for walkway borders and flower beds. Junipers are easy to grow but tend to grow slowly. Once established, they are cold hardy (espe- cially J. communis), drought tolerant, and they require minimal maintenance. Soil quality is of little concern to these plants, but they do appreciate at least a slightly acidic pH level, so if necessary, amend your soil with some redwood compost. When you visit the nursery, remember that only the female plants bear the sought-after berries and that you will need at least two plants (a male and a female) to produce fruit. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For inflam- mations of the urinary tract, consider couch grass, gravelroot, corn silk, plan- tain, and uva ursi before using juniper. Marshmallow adds soothing and lubricat- ing protection when added to juniper. For urinary tract infections, look at echinacea, sage, thyme, and Oregon grape as alter- natives or adjuncts. For treating fleabites and other skin irritations, juniper com- bines well in a skin rinse with calendula, chamomile, or peppermint (or for that matter, any kind of mint). Cautions and Comments: Do not use juniper internally in animals with preexisting kidney disease or in preg- nant or lactating animals. The key rule with juniper is one that applies to all herbal remedies: Use with caution and always in moderation. And remember, what may be deemed excessive for one animal may be inadequate for another. Proper use of juniper is entirely depend- ent upon an accurate assessment of your companion’s specific needs and medical condition. Please see your holistic veterinarian first. LAVENDER Lavandula angustifolia Mint Family Appearance: With its delicate spikelike flowers, narrow silvery leaves, and sweet fragrance, lavender is a beautiful adorn- ment to any garden. There are several cultivars of Lavandula; the one most commonly found in nurseries is English lavender (L. angustifolia). Habitat and Range: A Mediterranean native that is in cultivation throughout much of the world Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in early to midsummer Parts Used: Flowers, leaves, and stems Primary Medicinal Activities: Elevates mood (antidepressive), antibacterial, astringent, analgesic, antispasmodic, tonic Strongest Affinities: Skin, nervous sys- tem, respiratory tract, joints Preparation: Diluted essential oil, tea, dried flower bunches, sachets Common Uses: The essential oil of lavender works wonders to calm a nerv- ous or excited animal. In depressed or aggressive animals, lavender can be used to lift spirits and adjust attitudes. In these Herbs for Pets 140 l Materia Medica 141 l applications, the oil is not applied to the animal itself but is used in aromatherapy. An open bottle of the oil is waved under the animal’s nostrils, or a few drops are put on a piece of cardboard that is placed near the animal’s bedding, under a car seat, or on the outside of a travel carrier. The sweet aroma helps the ani- mal (and her human guardian) to relax during an otherwise restless experience. Oftentimes the effects are instantaneous. A small sachet bag can be filled with lavender flowers and placed near the ani- mal for the same (but less reliable) effect. A few drops of the essential oil can be added to some water and placed in a vaporizer (or a potpourri simmering pot) and used to treat coughs and respiratory infections. When emitted near the ani- mal in a closed room, the vapor helps to open respiratory passages and inhibit bacterial reproduction in the lungs. For joint inflammation, stiffness, or pain, 10 drops of the essential oil can be added to 1 ounce of apricot kernel or almond oil (these absorb into skin more readily than olive oil). The mixture then can be liberally massaged into the affect- ed area to bring relief. The oil mixture is also useful for insect bites and stings and is an excellent addition to first aid salves. A good tick repellent oil for dogs can be made from 300 milliliters of olive oil or other oil, 500 milliliters of essential oil of terebinth, 100 milliliters of Saint- John’s-wort–infused oil, and 100 milli- liters of essential oil of lavender. This recipe makes about a liter of the oil. It can be massaged on affected areas to help ticks drop off. As a preventative, it can be massaged on areas of the dog that are most likely to come into contact with ticks. Avoid using essential oils on or around cats. A tea of the fresh or dried flowers, leaves, and stems can be used as an external skin rinse for relief from pain and itching caused by seborrhea, con- tact dermatitis, or fleabites. The rinse helps to fight bacterial infection as well. Be sure the rinse is well diluted—the water should be slightly tinted but still fragrant. Availability: The essential oil can be purchased through natural product retailers, as can the dried flowers. Plants are available through most nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Lavender is winter hardy, drought resistant, and easy to grow from transplants. Plants prefer well-drained, sandy soil with a pH between 6.4 and 8.3 (acidic soil should be amended with hydrated lime or soft rock phosphate). Alternatives and Adjuncts: For joint problems, lavender combines with Lavandula angustifolia yarrow, arnica, Saint-John’s-wort, or cayenne. For respiratory infections, try adding yarrow to a vaporizer. For calm- ing effects, lavender aromatherapy used in conjunction with an internal dose of passionflower, skullcap, valerian, or hop can be effective. Cautions and Comments: Although all parts of the dried or above-ground parts of this plant are generally safe when used in raw form or in simple teas, the highly concentrated essential oil of lavender can be very hard on the liver and kidneys. Therefore, it should not be ingested. Nor should the oil be used on the skin in undiluted form because it may cause irritation. Avoid using essen- tial oils on or around cats. LICORICE Glycyrrhiza glabra Pea Family and G. lepidota Appearance: Licorice is a member of the pea family and can be characterized by its greenish white, pealike axillary flowers; pinnately divided pealike leaves (divided into pairs of lance-shaped leaflets); and inclination to climb and tan- gle among other plants. At first glance, licorice looks like any one of thousands of wild legumes. Fortunately, our wild American licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidota) has characteristics that make it unique and easy to identify. It is a large legume (3–7 feet tall when mature) with an exceptionally stout reddish main stem. But even more distinguishing are its 1⁄2- inch-long, tightly clustered seed pods, which are covered with conspicuous hooked spines. No other legume in North America presents this characteristic. Habitat and Range: The vast majority of licorice root sold in North America is G. glabra, a native of southeast Europe that probably came over with the first Anglo settlers. Of the twenty-five or so species that can be found worldwide, we have only one native species in North America: G. lepidota. All other species have been naturalized from Europe or Asia. American licorice occurs sporadical- ly across North America, and like its alien relatives that in many areas have escaped cultivation, it is generally to be found in moist ravines, in roadside ditches, in waste areas, and along the banks of irri- gation canals where soils are rich and deep. Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial or short-lived perennial that reproduces by seed. Blooms in midsummer. Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Expect- orant; helps with blood cleansing; lubri- cates, soothes, and protects mucous membranes; anti-inflammatory; antiviral; adrenal stimulant; mild laxative; immunos- timulant. Strongest Affinities: Respiratory, digestive, and endocrine systems Preparation: Fresh or dried chopped root, tea, tincture Common Uses: Numerous studies have confirmed that licorice is an effective and fast-acting anti-inflammatory agent. In fact, many herbalists regard it as nature’s answer to hydrocortisone and claim that it potentiates the effectiveness of other herbs when added to compound formu- las. All of this is primarily attributable to licorice’s content of glycyrrhizin, a com- pound with a chemical structure similar to that of the corticosteroids that are naturally released by the body’s adrenal Herbs for Pets 142 l Materia Medica 143 l glands. Glycyrrhizin effectively stimulates the adrenals into action and is especially useful for treating Addison’s disease. Licorice provides anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunostimulant, and corticosteroid-like actions—thus helping to relieve pain, itching, and inflamma- tion without completely bypassing the body’s normal anti-inflammatory func- tions and without seriously compromis- ing the immune system. This makes licorice useful for a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. In a study where arthritis was induced in rats through injections of formaldehyde, a by-product of glycyrrhizin called glycyrrhetinic acid was produced in the body and was shown to have obvious antiarthritic actions that were comparable to those of hydrocortisone. Glycyrrhizin has also been shown to potentiate the effects of cortisone-like drugs in the body, which makes licorice a useful adjunct in hydro- cortisone therapies. The theory here is that the potentiating effect of licorice allows for lower drug dosages without compromising therapeutic effectiveness. Used in this capacity, licorice should help reduce the debilitating side effects of steroid drugs in long-term therapies and may also assure safe withdrawal when the patient is weaned off of the steroids. The anti-inflammatory properties of licorice root are also apparent when the herb is topically applied. Licorice tea, salve, or oil infusion can be used to relieve the uncomfortable symptoms of various skin disorders such as psoriasis, eczema, contact dermatitis, and flea allergies. Used in this capacity, licorice provides a degree of relief during long- term holistic therapies, including a detoxification and allergy therapy con- sisting of internal doses of burdock, dandelion, alfalfa, or other alterative herbs. In this example, the animal receives relief from suffering, but the underlying metabolic causes are also addressed through tonification of the involved body systems. To make a simple oil infusion, all you need is some chopped dried licorice root (available at any good herb retailer) and some olive oil. Put the root into a glass jar and cover it with enough oil to leave a 1⁄2-inch layer of liquid above the herb. Cover the jar tightly, put it in a warm (55–75° F) place, away from sunlight, and let it sit for one month. After a month, strain the oil through a sieve, then squeeze what you can from the herb by wrapping it in unbleached muslin or cheesecloth. You’ll have a sweet-tasting licorice oil that keeps for several months if refrigerated. Use it top- ically as needed, but expect your com- panion to lick it off—it tastes like candy. In addition to its powerful anti- inflammatory actions, licorice root is Glycyrrhiza lepidota beneficial in the treatment and preven- tion of many forms of liver disease. Over the past two decades, medical researchers in China and Japan have found (through animal studies) that extracts of licorice root are useful in the treatment of chronic and chemically induced hepatitis and that the herb has liver-protectant qualities similar to those offered by the popular liver herb milk thistle (Silybum marianum). However, the mechanisms by which licorice root works in the liver are quite different from those of milk thistle. While milk thistle has been shown to resist liver cell destruction largely through protection of the cell walls and by antioxidant actions, licorice works through a broad- er set of effects. In addition to a protec- tant action that glycyrrhizin has upon the liver cells, licorice also enhances interferon and T cell production, two natural actions that are critical to liver repair and general resistance to disease. In Chinese medicine, licorice is com- monly used as a liver detoxifier in the treatment of obstructive jaundice. And in several studies, licorice has been shown to benefit animals suffering from liver damage due to absorbed or ingest- ed toxins such as carbon tetrachloride. In a recent study, the root of G. uralensis (an Asian species of licorice) was found to have a potentiating effect on the reticuloendothelial system, the body’s first line of defense against infec- tion. In essence, the reticuloendothelial system is composed of specialized cells whose jobs are to seek out and eliminate invading microbes and dead blood cells, and licorice helps to stimulate these little bloodstream warriors into action. Licorice is also an excellent demul- cent, anti-inflammatory, and expecto- rant for the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts. It is especially good for healing ulceration of the stomach and reducing the gastric acid secretions that often contribute to the severity of ulcers. For bronchitis, licorice works well at reducing inflammation while adding antiviral, antibacterial, and soothing demulcent actions to any variety of other respiratory herbs that may be employed such as mullein, coltsfoot, and grindelia. When giving licorice to your animal, you are likely to find the best results when using liquid extracts (tinctures). Feeding dried chopped roots to herbi- vores is fine if tolerated, but dogs and cats have short digestive tracts that may not absorb the active constituents quick- ly and completely. Herb tinctures are free-form medicines: their active compo- nents are readily available and quickly assimilated early in the digestive process. This means that less of the active materi- al is lost during digestion and more ends up in your cat instead of in her litter box. Dosage is entirely dependent upon indi- vidual needs and circumstances and should be determined by a trained prac- titioner, but 12–20 drops per 20 pounds of body weight, two times daily, of low- alcohol licorice extract is a conservative starting point for dogs, cats, and other small animals. Horses can be fed the equivalent of up to 1 ounce (10–30 grams) of the dried root, or about 1⁄4 ounce of the tincture daily. You can triple the liquid dosages if you are using a cooled tea (1 teaspoon of the root to 1 cup of water). Availability: Licorice can be planted from root cuttings or seed, both of which are available from nursery cata- logs that specialize in herbs. Propagation and Harvest: To grow licorice in your garden, plant it in moist, deep, well-drained, nutrient-rich sandy loam with a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Although it is adaptable to various Herbs for Pets 144 l Materia Medica 145 m climates, licorice does best in areas with long, warm growing seasons. (If you can’t meet these demands, don’t worry. This plant survives just about anywhere.) Dig the perennial roots during the fall of their third or fourth year of growth— younger roots won’t be as potent. After digging, cut the roots into small pieces and dry them on newspaper, away from sunlight. The completely dried roots keep for one to two years if properly stored in plastic bags in a cool, dry, dark place. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For stom- ach ulcers and other gastric disorders that are secondary to bacterial or para- sitic infection, licorice combines with Oregon grape. To provide secondary anti-inflammatory relief in the gastroin- testinal or urinary tract, consider corn silk, couch grass, or uva ursi as adjuncts. For respiratory problems, consider ele- campane, coltsfoot, grindelia, mullein, slippery elm, plantain, marshmallow, and wild cherry bark as possible substi- tutes or adjuncts. For liver problems, look toward milk thistle, dandelion root, Oregon grape, red clover, and burdock as possible adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: As for all herbal medicines, the primary rule is moderation and insight when using licorice. Throughout its long history as a medicine, licorice has been the subject of controversies. When used in large, high- ly concentrated doses, especially over long periods, several hydrocortisone-like side effects may occur: water retention, hypertension, loss of potassium, sodium retention, and other symptoms of adre- nal hyperactivity. In human studies, the large majority of these side effects have been observed following the excessive consumption of European licorice candy, which is made from a concentrated pressed extract of the root. (American- produced licorice candy contains ab- solutely no real licorice but instead an artificial flavoring or the extracts of other plants that taste similar.) Most herbalists and practitioners agree that the risks of adverse side effects from licorice are lim- ited to those who abuse it. We, however, have never seen a case of licorice- induced toxicity. Nevertheless, licorice should not be used with reckless aban- don or in normal doses for periods exceeding two weeks without the in- struction of a qualified practitioner. If a licorice therapy does exceed two weeks, then the treated animal’s diet should be adjusted to accommodate increased needs for potassium and to eliminate excess sodium. Dandelion leaf is well indicated here because it works as an effective diuretic to prevent water reten- tion while providing an excellent source of supplemental potassium. Animals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions should not be given licorice without pro- fessional guidance. Licorice may temporarily elevate blood sugar levels and should be used with caution in diabetic animals. It has also been shown to have estrogenic properties that may affect uterine func- tions. Therefore, licorice should be used with caution in pregnant or nursing animals. MARSHMALLOW Althea officinalis Mallow Family Appearance: Marshmallow is a stout plant that may grow as high as 7 feet. It has alternate 3- to 5-lobed leaves and showy 2- to 3-inch flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The entire plant is covered with fine, soft hairs, a trait that gives the foliage a dusty appearance. Habitat and Range: A native of west- ern and central Europe, marshmallow has become naturalized in the U.S., where it grows in marshes and moist meadows throughout the New England states. It has become a popular garden herb throughout the world and is easy to grow. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from late June through September Parts Used: Primarily the root. The foliage is useful, too, but does not make as good a medicine. Primary Medicinal Activities: Soothes and lubricates internal tissues, soothes skin, antimicrobial, lowers blood sugar, immunostimulant. Strongest Affinities: Skin and respira- tory, digestive, and urinary tracts Preparation: Tea, low-alcohol tincture, fresh or dried chopped root Common Uses: Marshmallow has a long history as a medicine. The word Althea is derived from the ancient Greek word altheo, meaning “to cure.” With few exceptions, marshmallow is among the safest and most versatile herbs for animals. The root of the mature plant contains up to 35 percent mucilage. This makes marshmallow useful in situa- tions that involve surface irritation of the skin or internal mucous mem- branes. It is particularly helpful for uri- nary tract inflammations compounded by the presence of gravel in the urine (urinary calculus) and in digestive disor- ders where ulceration or infection is fur- ther aggravated by the presence of food or other solids. In these cases, marshmallow provides a soothing, lubricating, protective barrier between mucous membranes and substances that contribute to the irritation. Marshmallow also soothes upper respi- ratory irritations that are secondary to a dry, raspy cough. Used on the surface of the body, marshmallow brings relief to insect bites, stings, abscesses, and inflammations that are secondary to injury or infection. In addition to the soothing nature of mucilage, marshmal- low has antimicrobial and immune- stimulating properties. In animal stud- ies, it has been shown to be active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus, bacterial infections that are commonly seen in the digestive tract, urinary tract, skin, and ears of dogs, cats, horses, ferrets, and other animals. A dab of marshmallow tincture also serves as an excellent antimicrobial lubricant for a rectal thermometer. For internal use of marshmallow root, a tea or low-alcohol tincture is usually the best choice. The dried or fresh root may be a better option for problems such as colitis that are deep within the digestive system. This is because marshmallow’s mucilage is highly water soluble and may not reach the lower end of the digestive tract unless it is carried there in a solid con- tainer, namely the chopped or ground root. If you opt to use a tincture of this herb, make sure that it doesn’t contain more than 20 percent alcohol (actually, none is needed). The mucilage con- stituents aren’t taken up well in alcohol, and if too much is used in the tincture- making process, the end product will cause nausea when ingested. We like glycerin tinctures of this herb, not only for this reason but because the glycerin itself adds soothing, protective qualities to the medicine. Marshmallow glycerite Herbs for Pets 146 m Materia Medica 147 m can be squirted directly into an animal’s mouth—about 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, three times daily or as needed. Alternatively, a tea can be made by steeping a teaspoon of the dried chopped root (or 2 teaspoons of fresh root) in 8 ounces of very hot water. Stir the tea frequently until it has cooled to lukewarm. You should be able to feel the slippery, oily nature of the mucilage when you rub a few drops of the tea between your thumb and index finger. If not, add more marshmallow root. One teaspoon of the tea is a good start- ing dose for dogs. Cats usually benefit from a 1⁄2 teaspoon. It’s also good for lubricating and expelling fur balls. For lower gastrointestinal problems or to help relieve constipation (in a manner similar to that of psyllium husks), the dried powdered root can be added to an animal’s food at a rate of a 1⁄2 tea- spoon for each pound of food fed (1⁄4 teaspoon for cats and other small ani- mals), once or twice daily. For horses, 1 ounce of the powdered root can be added to feed each day to aid in cases of cystitis, colitis, or chronic spasmodic colic. For problems that are close to the rectum such as a swollen anal gland irri- tated by bowel movements, a small gel capsule might be necessary to carry the root powder through the digestive tract to the problem area. Another option is to administer a small amount of the cooled tea or glycerite as a rectal sup- pository using a soft plastic pipette or ear syringe. Marshmallow has been shown to cause hypoglycemic activity in animals. Although more research is warranted, marshmallow might be useful in treat- ing certain forms of diabetes. See your holistic veterinarian before trying it in this capacity. Availability: Marshmallow plants are available through most nurseries. Marshmallow root and various prepara- tions are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Marsh- mallow is easy to grow. It can be propa- gated by seed, root cuttings, or trans- plants. Although it requires ample water, it’s not picky about soil and is hardy and drought tolerant once established. Planting should occur in early spring. The roots are ready for harvest anytime dur- ing their third year of growth and every year thereafter. You do not have to kill your plant to dig up some of the root— simply divide what you need from the existing root system, and give the plant extra water until the roots regenerate. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For urinary problems, marshmallow combines well Althea officinalis with couch grass, horsetail, uva ursi, corn silk, echinacea, ginkgo, or any of the diuretic herbs. For coughs and upper res- piratory irritations, marshmallow com- bines with mullein, coltsfoot, elecampane, or grindelia. For digestive problems, con- sider combining licorice, chamomile, cal- endula, cleavers, fennel, dill, or any variety of mint with marshmallow. In horses, a combination of marshmallow, valerian, slippery elm, and licorice is good for a spastic colon. For infections or irritations of the skin of most animals, calendula, mullein flower, garlic, comfrey, and aloe are all complemented by marshmallow. Cautions and Comments: Marsh- mallow has long been used as a food plant, and its safety is substantiated by many years of use in both humans and animals. It is known to lower blood sugar levels, however, and therefore should be used with caution in hypoglycemic ani- mals. It may also retard the intestinal absorption of some drugs—at least for short periods, until the thick, viscous mucilage can be broken down in the digestive tract. MILK THISTLE Silybum marianum Sunflower Family Appearance: From a distance, milk this- tle looks very much like any other thistle: deeply lobed, often spiny leaves; stout, often spiny stems; and large, up to 2 inch- es wide, white to purple disk flowers, each resembling a miniature artichoke (anoth- er thistle). Closer inspection of milk thistle reveals a weblike pattern on the surfaces of the leaves, a characteristic that sets it apart from its many cousins. Milk thistle may grow to 7 feet tall. Habitat and Range: A native of the Mediterranean region of Europe, milk thistle has become naturalized in many portions of North America. In many areas it has earned the reputation of being an invasive weed. Milk thistle is cultivated throughout much of the world for its medicinal seeds. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or biennial that blooms June through July Parts Used: Ripe seeds Primary Medicinal Activities: Protects and strengthens the liver Strongest Affinities: Liver Preparation: Alcohol tincture or a stan- dardized powder extract (usually con- tained in gel capsules). A high concen- tration of alcohol is required to extract the active constituents from the ground seeds. Be skeptical of milk thistle tincture products whose labels claim low or no alcohol. Common Uses: Milk thistle has a long ethno-botanical history that gives it stature as much more than a liver herb. It has been used to treat everything from cancer to poor milk production in nursing mothers, but it is most effective in protecting and regenerating the liver. Most of milk thistle’s usefulness can be attributed to its silymarin con- stituent. Dozens of studies have con- firmed that silymarin and its related compounds support and protect the liver during crisis by accelerating the rate of protein synthesis and stimulat- ing production of new cells to replace damaged ones. These compounds work as powerful antioxidants and strengthen liver cell resistance to toxic compounds, while at the same time Herbs for Pets 148 m Materia Medica 149 m stimulating cellular reproduction. Much of what we know about these activities stems from the discovery that silymarin can be used to antidote amanita (death cap) mushroom poi- soning. When intravenous silymarin is administered within twenty-four to forty-eight hours of ingestion, toxic compounds that would normally destroy liver cells are prevented from penetrating the cell walls, and liver damage is greatly minimized. Scientific research has also con- firmed that milk thistle protects the liver from the harmful effects of various other toxins. Specifically, milk thistle protects an animal’s liver during a toxicity-related crisis (such as exposure to toxic chemicals or potentially harm- ful drug therapies) and helps the animal through a liver damage or disease crisis. It can be used in dogs, cats, horses, goats, ferrets, and rodents to aid in liver or kidney damage, hepatitis, jaundice, leptospirosis, and parvovirus recovery. Milk thistle may prove helpful for treat- ing liver tumors, cancers, and skin prob- lems that are secondary to liver disease. Animals who have been on allopathic drugs, heartworm medication, de- wormers, vaccinations, anticonvulsive drugs, or chemotherapy might benefit from this herb as well. Milk thistle can also help block the potential liver- damaging effects of anesthesia and is often used both before and after sur- gery in Germany. Medical and biologi- cal studies support its use in reducing the toxic effect of heavy metals if administered soon enough. Despite much of the publicity that has been generated about this “won- der herb,” milk thistle should not be used as a daily food supplement. Milk thistle is a medicine that is best reserved for situations in which the liver is already under abnormal stress. When used in absence of preexisting stress, milk thistle probably won’t do any harm, but on the other hand it might cause digestive disorders or it might impair other body-cleansing functions of the liver. Many herbalists believe that it can actually slow the metabolic functions of a healthy liver. In any case, milk thistle is unnecessary unless there is a real and present need, and its use as a dietary supplement constitutes waste. Alcohol tinctures are the best for administering milk thistle because they allow quick and complete absorption of silymarin into the body. But in cases in which severe liver damage might be compounded by alcohol, or in animals with alcohol hypersensitivity, a stan- dardized powder extract (formulated to contain 60–80 percent silymarin) might be a better choice. In cases in which stress on the liver is suspected Silybum marianum but not yet serious, the alcohol extract can be administered at a starting dose of 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Before feeding it to your animal, dilute each dose with an equal amount or more of water to make the tincture more palatable and to minimize the astringency and burning sensation of the alcohol. The tincture can then be added to the animal’s food. In any sus- pected case of liver disease, a holistic veterinarian should be consulted before proceeding with the use of milk thistle or any other herb. Availability: Available in various formu- lations through herb retailers Propagation and Harvest: Milk this- tle is easy to grow, but the small yield of seeds per plant makes cultivation a pointless endeavor unless you own a farm rather than just a garden. Harvesting must be done when the seeds are completely ripe and dry but before they leave the plant with a gust of wind. In other words, leave the task to the people who farm it. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Licorice is another excellent liver-repairing herb that possesses a broader spectrum of medicinal activities than milk thistle. For mild to moderate liver disorders that are believed to be toxicity related and that are signified by chronic constipation, indigestion, or skin problems, milk thistle can be combined with dandelion, bur- dock, yellow dock, red clover, Oregon grape, or turmeric. Cautions and Comments: Milk thistle is a very safe herb. In studies that involve giving laboratory animals high doses of silymarin over long periods, the animals display no toxicity. MULLEIN Verbascum thapsus Figwort Family Appearance: This conspicuous plant is recognized during its first year of growth as a ground-hugging rosette of large, up to 12 inches long, broadly lance-shaped, profusely fuzzy leaves. During its second and final year of growth, mullein heads skyward with a stout central stalk that may exceed 6 feet in height. Numerous yellow flow- ers are then presented in a coblike clus- ter. There are several species of mullein to be found in North America. Verbascum thapsus is the most common and widespread. Habitat and Range: Mullein is a Eurasian import that has made itself at home in any variety of disturbed sites throughout North America. It is common to clear-cuts, burned areas, and partially developed lands in the West, where it often serves as an important earth regenerator, helping to regain biological balances and pre- vent erosion. Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial that blooms throughout the summer Parts Used: Leaves, flower heads, roots (each part represents different medi- cines) Primary Medicinal Activities: Expec- torant; antimicrobial; antiviral; cough sup- pressant; lubricates, soothes, and protects mucous membranes; astringent Strongest Affinities: Respiratory and urinary tracts, skin, and ears Preparation: Tea, tincture, oil infusion, compress, poultice Herbs for Pets 150 m Materia Medica 151 m Common Uses: This wayside weed is extremely useful, providing safe and effective medicine for a wide variety of ailments. The leaves are well known for their ability to ease spasmodic coughs while reducing inflammation and in- creasing mucus production in the bronchi, making coughs more produc- tive and allowing sufferers to rest easier. These qualities combine with antimicro- bial and antiviral properties, making mullein an herb of choice in the treat- ment of canine tracheobronchitis (ken- nel cough) and various other forms of respiratory distress in animals. Scientific studies have shown that a synergy of compounds contained in mullein leaf actively inhibits reproduc- tion of herpes simplex virus (HSV). This activity, combined with the antitussive and expectorant qualities of the plant, might prove useful in treating canine herpes virus (CHV) and feline viral rhino- tracheitis (FVR). Although more study is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of mullein against HSV infections in ani- mals, the safety of this plant and its demonstrated ability to relieve many of the discomforts of these diseases justifies giving it a try. A strong leaf tea can be used (10 milliliters per 30 pounds of a dog’s body weight, twice daily; 5 milli- liters twice daily for cats), or a glycerin tincture can be given directly into the mouth (1–2 milliliters per 20 pounds of an animal’s weight, twice daily). Mullein leaf is also practical in the treatment of asthma, especially when it is combined with elecampane, grindelia, or lobelia. (Please see the Lobelia section in the “Supplemental Herb List” for cautions about this herb.) The large leaves of mullein also make an excellent antimicrobial and astringent poultice for minor wounds and insect bites. Just mash up a few fresh or dried leaves with some water and apply the poultice directly to the affected area. Mullein leaf is said to lower the acidity of urine, as well, making the herb useful in the treatment of various urinary disor- ders where urine pH levels are too low. The flowering tops of mullein have antimicrobial properties with a special affinity toward infections of the ears, including those caused by ear mites. (Note: Ear problems are a sign of chron- ic disease in an animal who is on a com- mercial diet.) The best way to use the flowers is in the form of an oil infusion. The flowers also contain rotenone and a synergy of other insecticidal compounds, making mullein effective in the fight against fleas and mange. Some herbalists maintain that a tinc- ture of the root can be used to treat uri- nary incontinence. Urinary incontinence can be due to estrogen or testosterone deficiencies, neurogenic dysfunction, anatomical abnormalities, or paradoxical Verbascum thapsus obstruction from urethral calculi or neo- plasia, so contact your holistic vet to find the cause before proceeding with the use of mullein root. Availability: An abundant weed in much of North America. The seeds are available through specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: The leaves of mullein can be harvested anytime, pro- vided they look healthy. The flowers do not appear until the plants’ second year and should be plucked from the flower heads when they are wide open (we pre- fer to use them fresh). The first-year roots should be dug in fall, whereas the second- year roots should be dug in the spring, before the biennial plant begins to die. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For kennel cough and other respiratory problems, mullein leaf combines well with elecam- pane, grindelia, or horehound. For use in the ears, nothing compares to a combina- tion of garlic and mullein flower oil. Saint- John’s-wort oil and vitamin are also great adjuncts here. Other herbs to consider for urinary incontinence (alone or as adjuncts) include corn silk, uva ursi, couch grass, Saint-John’s-wort, and horsetail. Cautions and Comments: Keep mullein away from fish and amphibians. The rotenone contained in mullein is toxic to aquatic life. NETTLE Urtica dioica Nettle Family Appearance: Stinging nettle is an erect plant that may grow as high as 7 feet where conditions permit. It reproduces largely from its shallow horizontally creeping root system and is often found in dense patches. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with coarsely toothed mar- gins. Flowers are presented in inconspic- uous drooping clusters. Stems are cov- ered with fine stinging hairs. Young plants often emerge a reddish color, later turning green as they mature. Habitat and Range: Several species of nettle inhabit drainage ditches, stream banks, and other moist soils throughout North America and much of the Northern Hemisphere. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial, annual, or biennial (depending on species and climate) that blooms in early summer Parts Used: Leaves and stems of the preflowering plant and, to a lesser extent, the root Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutritive, antihistamine, astringent, tonic, helps with blood cleansing Strongest Affinities: Genitourinary tract, blood, skin, and eyes Preparation: Dried herb (directly fed), tea, poultice, tincture Common Uses: All species of Urtica cause an instantaneous contact dermati- tis that is characterized by tiny blisters and a burning sting. Fortunately, nettle’s unpleasant, self-initiated introduction is usually short lived, and those who can learn to accept nettle’s characteristics are bound to realize the precious gifts this somewhat obnoxious plant has to offer. Despite its downside, we recognize this plant as one of nature’s best nutraceuti- cals. Ironically, nettle is actually quite delicious, nutritious, and rich with heal- ing opportunities. Although gloves and a long-sleeved shirt must be worn when gathering the Herbs for Pets 152 n Materia Medica 153 n greens, complete drying or cooking neu- tralizes the plant’s antigenic proteins and formic acid compounds—the con- stituents responsible for the plant’s sting. These compounds break down quickly when exposed to air or heat, and when correctly prepared, the leafy greens of young nettle plants are delicious and contain a vast array of vitamins, miner- als, and nutrients. In fact, 100 grams of dried preflowering nettle plant contains up to 30.4 grams (30 percent by weight) of crude protein, 2,970 milligrams of cal- cium, 680 milligrams of phosphorus, 32.2 milligrams of iron, 650 milligrams of magnesium, 20.2 milligrams of beta- carotene, and 3,450 milligrams of potas- sium, along with vitamins A, C, D, and B complex—all in a highly palatable form that can be effectively assimilated into the body without adding excess stress upon the liver, kidneys, or digestive tract. Nettle therefore makes an excellent addi- tion to food for animals who need extra trace minerals and vitamins in their diet but not necessarily in huge, multivitamin doses. This applies to animals who are already on a natural diet or those who are sensitive to excessive vitamin or min- eral supplementation because of chronic digestive disorders, existing systemic toxicity, or urinary tract problems. The completely dried herb can be sprinkled directly onto the animals’ food—1⁄2 tea- spoon for each pound of food fed to dogs, or 1⁄3 teaspoon per meal for cats. Herbivores can be fed the dried greens in their usual diet, and many will relish net- tle as a special treat. In Sweden and Russia, where the problem of producing nutrient-rich feeds is compounded by a short growing season, winter-hardy net- tles are sometimes cultivated as fodder crops and then dried. For finicky pets who despise any- thing but what their humans are eating, try cooking the fresh young plants with enough water to cover them until they are soft and tender. The cooked greens are excellent with butter, and after your furry friend has watched you relish them for a while, you can stir some into her food. Although many herbal preparations for the eyes typically use a plant called eyebright (Euphrasia sp.) as a primary anti-inflammatory agent, many herbal- ists are becoming concerned about the increasing scarcity of this wild-harvested herb. Fortunately, nature always provides us with a diversity of herbal options—all that is required is for us to ignore market sensationalism and embrace the use of our less compromised plant allies. Nettle, a much more abundant plant, is a good alternative to eyebright. Nettle leaf tea is an excellent skin and coat rinse that nourishes animals’ fur and provides symptomatic relief for itchy skin and fleabites. Urtica dioica Many herbalists who suffer from sea- sonal allergies have found that nettle leaf tincture or tea helps lessen their symp- toms if taken on a regular basis. In a recent study involving sixty-nine patients who suffer from allergic rhinitis, 58 per- cent found relief after taking a freeze- dried preparation of the leaf. Although the theories behind the medicinal actions of nettle are varied, we believe that part of the basis for net- tle’s antiallergenic usefulness may lie in the plant’s histamine content, which may work in a like-versus-like manner similar to the concepts of homeopathy. What we mean is that by introducing a substance into the body that acts mild- ly as an allergenic antagonist, the body is triggered into protecting itself from what it believes to be an inevitable, all- out attack of allergens. In short, nettle may prompt the body into preparing itself. For animals with predictable sea- sonal occurrences of allergies, dietary supplementation with dried nettle leaf may help. Nettle root may be useful in the treat- ment of prostate enlargement, especially at early onset of the disorder. Although a swollen prostate is not as common in animals as in humans, this disorder is sometimes secondary to a chronic or acute infection, poor diet, inflammatory disease, or injuries of the urinary tract, especially in older animals. In a study conducted on human subjects who had mild cases or early onset of prostatic ade- noma (a degenerative enlargement of the glandular part of the prostate that typically results in frequent urination during the night), the fluid extract (tinc- ture) of nettle root was found to reduce the duration and volume of urine reten- tion and thus the need to urinate throughout the night. The active con- stituent in this case is believed to be Beta-sitosterol, a phytosterol known to possess mild anti-inflammatory activity. Although this action is not likely to reduce the formation of scar tissue with- in the urinary tract and prostate, it is believed to relieve symptoms through reduction of swelling in surrounding tis- sues. Given the safety of this herb and the functional similarities between the prostates of animals and humans, nettle is certainly worth a try. Keep in mind that large doses of nettle can be irritat- ing to the kidneys if given over an extended period of time, particularly if an animal has preexisting kidney disease or if the herb was gathered too late in its growth cycle. Availability: Available wherever bulk herbs are sold Propagation and Harvest: Nettle can be transplanted from root cuttings, but the plant tends to be somewhat choosy about where it grows. Although we know exactly where the plant should thrive, our efforts to introduce nettle to such an area have met with a less than 50 percent success rate. In other words, you are probably better off finding a healthy patch of wild plants to collect your herb. Gather the plants before they bloom—the younger the better. Mature plants begin to develop cystoliths, tiny crystalline particles in the leaf tissues that can irritate the urinary tract and kidneys when ingested in large enough quanti- ties. After gathering, you can boil the greens and serve them as you would spinach, or you can spread them onto clean newspapers and allow them to dry in a well-ventilated, sunlight-free loca- tion until they are crispy. For obvious reasons, gloves and a long-sleeved shirt should be worn when handling nettle plants. If a leaf or stem manages to sneak under your shirtsleeve, try this trick: grasp a piece of the stem Herbs for Pets 154 n Materia Medica 155 o and squeeze some of the nettle juice onto the affected area. The stem juice is rich in lecithin, which is believed to anti- dote the sting. We manage to get stung by this plant several times each spring, and we find relief by using this method in many of our adverse encounters. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For anti- inflammatory eye and skin washes, alter- natives include raspberry leaf, chamomile, dandelion, calendula, or oxeye daisy. For conjunctivitis that is secondary to bacte- rial or fungal infection, nettle combines well with Oregon grape. Nutritive adjuncts include spirulina, flaxseed, red clover, and alfalfa. For allergies, nettle combines well with elecampane, colts- foot, goldenrod, lobelia, or licorice as lesser adjuncts. For urinary incontinence and inflammations of the urinary tract, consider couch grass, corn silk, cleavers, uva ursi, goldenrod, and marshmallow as adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Touching the live plant results in a painful, blister- ing sting. Thorough drying or cooking neutralizes the toxic constituents. Some herbalists believe that this plant should be used before it flowers—mature plants contain gritty particles that can irritate the kidneys. Animals who are predis- posed to plant allergies may be sensitive to nettle—proceed with care. OAT Avena sativa Grass Family Appearance: Oats look very much like any other tall grass, and positive identifi- cation can be difficult if you’re not famil- iar with the fine details specific to the var- ious cultivars of the Avena genus. Wild oat (A. fatua), a common and often hated weed, has the same medicinal attributes as its cultivated relatives. The leaves of the seedlings and seeds of this 1- to 4-foot-tall plant have two unique features that differ- entiate it from its cultivated cousins and most other wild grasses. The first feature is the leaves. Early in growth, they have a counterclockwise twist in them; as the plant matures, the leaves progressively straighten out. The second unique char- acteristic is the plant’s seeds, which at maturity are presented in loosely arranged drooping spikelets. Each spikelet contains two or three foxtail-like seeds that have proportionately long hairlike awns, each of which has a right angle kink in it, giving the appearance of a crimped cockroach feeler. Habitat and Range: Several cultivars of A. sativa are commercially grown throughout the world. Wild oat (A. fatua) is a native of Europe that has been intro- duced into meadows, pastures, and Avena sativa waste areas throughout much of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms from June to August. The seeds of wild oat can remain dormant in the soil for more than eight years, mak- ing it difficult to eradicate from areas where it isn’t wanted. Parts Used: Post-flowering tops are used before the seeds fully mature. This is called the plant’s milk stage. Herbalists refer to these parts as oatstraw. Primary Medicinal Activities: Im- proves nerve functions, nutritive, anti- inflammatory Strongest Affinities: Nervous system Preparation: Tea, tincture, fresh or dried herb Common Uses: Oatstraw is perhaps the best nervous system tonic for aging or debilitated animals. Not only does the herb contain considerable amounts of protein (gluten), vitamins, and minerals (especially calcium, manganese, iron, copper, and zinc) that are essential to the maintenance of health, but it contains various alkaloid, sterol, and flavonoid con- stituents that act together to safely opti- mize nervous system functions while sta- bilizing the highs and lows between nerv- ousness and mental lethargy. For instance, when fed in moderation to ani- mals with chronic nervousness, oatstraw tends to have a calming effect, but when fed to debilitated animals, it tends to stim- ulate the nervous system. Oatstraw tea or tincture is an excellent choice for animals recovering from exhaustion or suffering from depression disorders. It is known to improve nerve transmission and can be useful for problems such as epilepsy, tremors, paralysis, and twitching. It is a good tonic for nourishing the body and strengthening nerve function following periods of sedation or anesthesia. Dried oatstraw brews into a deli- cious tea that can be poured directly onto dog or cat food as a quickly assim- ilated tonic supplement. Infuse a heap- ing teaspoon of oatstraw in 8 ounces of hot water. Feeding 1 ounce of the cooled tea daily is a good amount for cats and animals of similar size. Give 2–4 ounces to most dogs. Glycerin tinctures are also good and can be added to your companion’s diet at a daily rate of 1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon (1–2 milli- liters) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Oatstraw is highly water soluble, so there is no point in using an alcohol-based tincture if nonalcohol alternatives are available. Of course, oats are a well-known feed for horses and other herbivores and should be included as part of their daily diet. In terms of tonic value, fresh oat greens are vastly superior to what is pur- chased in grain bags, but the greens must be fed in moderation. A few large hand- fuls can be added to the daily diet, but too much may cause hyperexcitability. Oatmeal can be included as part of your companion’s natural diet. It can also be used externally as a soothing bath for skin problems. Availability: Oatstraw is available through health food stores Propagation and Harvest: Oat is easy to grow, but it takes up a great deal of garden space. If you opt to grow it, har- vest the top 6–12 inches of the plants after the seeds have formed but before the plants begin to dry. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For depression disorders, oatstraw can be Herbs for Pets 156 o Materia Medica 157 o combined with Saint-John’s-wort, pas- sionflower, or chamomile (but consider changing you companion’s diet first). For treating epilepsy, oatstraw combines with skullcap, valerian, or kava kava. In animals who are recovering from anes- thesia or sedation, alterative and diuretic herbs should be combined with oatstraw in order to help cleanse and nourish the blood and eliminate systemic waste. Possibilities include red clover, dandelion leaf, alfalfa, garlic, and nettle. For older animals who need continuous nervous system support, oatstraw combines especially well with nettle, red clover, alfalfa, and spirulina. Cautions and Comments: Too much oatstraw may cause excitability or vomit- ing. If this occurs, simply reduce the amount being fed to the animal. OREGON GRAPE Mahonia aquifolium Barberry Family Appearance: At first glance, Oregon grape looks similar to American holly (Ilex opaca)—the stuff we deck the halls with during the Christmas sea- son. The almost plasticlike leaves of this perennial evergreen plant are divided into several opposing pairs of oval to lance-shaped, 1⁄2- to 3-inch-long leaflets. The leaf edges have conspicu- ous sharp spines. Flowers are yellow and are borne in clusters at the end of a sturdy central stalk. By midsummer, the flowers develop into clusters of juicy, purple, 1⁄4-to 1⁄2-inch fruits that resemble tiny grapes. The fruits are edi- ble but very sour. Habitat and Range: Three species of Oregon grape are common in the conifer- ous forests of western North America, ranging through the mountains of central California and New Mexico northward into Canada. Tall Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium) is a variety that grows up to 6 feet tall and is abundant in the coastal forests to the west slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Mahonia repens and M. ner- vosa are smaller (up to 12 inches tall), ground-hugging versions that are wide- spread throughout their range. A fourth less-common species (M. pinnata) inhab- its the mountains of Baja Mexico and California. All share similar appearances, the primary differentiating factor being their size. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennial evergreens that bloom in late spring Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, stimulates bile production, anti- inflammatory, tonic, antiparasitic Mahonia aquifolium Strongest Affinities: Liver and diges- tive system, mucous membranes Preparation: Tincture, tea, decoction, oil infusion, powdered root Common Uses: For most purposes, Oregon grape serves as an excellent alternative to goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), an herb that is currently at risk of going extinct from the pressures of overharvest and loss of habitat. Fortunately, Oregon grape remains com- mon and abundant over a much wider range than the overharvested goldenseal and is much easier to cultivate. So unless you have access to a cultivated source of goldenseal, please use Oregon grape instead. As is the case for goldenseal, a bitter yellow alkaloid called berberine is prima- rily responsible for the strong antimicro- bial activity of Oregon grape. The anti- bacterial properties of berberine have been shown to be more effective than some forms of prescription antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, when used against various forms of staphylococci. Berberine has also been shown to be active against E. coli and other gram- negative-type bacteria. It is even effec- tive against giardiasis, a parasitic infesta- tion of the digestive tract that is reputed- ly difficult to remedy. Like goldenseal, Oregon grape extract is especially useful in the ears, eyes, and the mucous mem- branes of the vagina and urinary tract, where it combats various fungal infec- tions as well. For bacterial ear infections or ear mites, an oil infusion of the fresh or dried root works best. To make an oil infusion, cut up the root as finely as possible and place it into a food processor or blender that has a glass or stainless steel blending vessel. (The roots are tough and might cause plastic to crack.) Cover the chopped root with enough olive oil to leave a 1⁄2-inch-thick layer above the herb. Put the lid on and blend until the oil is a vibrant, goldenrod-yellow color (about ten minutes). Strain the chopped root out through a fine sieve, and you’ll have a nice, antimicrobial ear oil. If you don’t wish to use your blender, you can let the chopped herb and olive oil mix- ture stand in a covered jar at room tem- perature for one month before straining. The finished product keeps for several months, sometimes years, if refrigerated. To use the oil, apply 1–10 drops at a time in each ear one to two times a day until the infection is gone. It is also good as a general topical antibiotic for stings, insect bites, cuts, abrasions, puncture injuries of the paws, and other injuries. Oregon grape is effective in treating conjunctivitis, where it fights infection and reduces inflammation. To treat your companion’s eyes with Oregon grape, dilute 4 drops of the alcohol tincture (available at your favorite herb store), or 8 drops of a root decoction, into 1 ounce of sterile saline (available anywhere con- tact lens supplies are sold). Place a few drops into the infected eye, taking note of any discomfort that may result from the berberine or the alcohol content of the tincture. Some animals are more intolerant than others. If the solution appears to irritate the eyes, dilute it with more saline and flush the eye with plain saline before applying more solution. Oregon grape root is also noted for its ability to stimulate liver function. It is particularly helpful in cases of chronic constipation associated with poor pro- tein or fat metabolism, situations that often lead to itchy, flaky skin and a dull coat in animals. Used under these cir- cumstances, Oregon grape extract can bring fast and dramatic results, and it does so by addressing an underlying cause of the problem. Generally speak- Herbs for Pets 158 o Materia Medica 159 o ing from a holistic perspective, many forms of dermatitis are symptoms of an underlying liver dysfunction. If the liver cannot eliminate excess toxins or is func- tionally compromised by blockages that reduce bile flow or production, the digestive tract fails at its job of eliminat- ing waste. One of the first places the body tries to force elimination is through the skin. Oregon grape works in the liver much like a strong version of dande- lion—bile production and flow is increased, and digestive efficiency is improved. But Oregon grape stimulates liver function much faster than does dan- delion, irritating the organ into working harder. For this reason, Oregon grape should not be used in animals with acute liver disease or existing liver injuries with- out the supervision of a trained profes- sional. And although Oregon grape is safe when used properly, it is likely to overexcite the liver of most animals if used excessively. If this occurs, your ani- mal will probably vomit because of excessive bile in the stomach; you should stop using Oregon grape and consider a gentler herb such as dandelion. In any case, it is best not to give any herbal medicine every day of an animal’s life. Instead, give whatever herbs you are using four to five days per week, then let the animal’s system rest for two or three days before proceeding. This break time also gives you an opportunity to monitor changes that may be occurring as a result of your therapeutic efforts. The bitter tonic action of the alkaloid constituents in Oregon grape make this herb a useful digestive aid. When a drop or two of the root tincture is placed on the tongue, or when a leaf is chewed, an instantaneous salivary response occurs. At the same time, mechanisms are triggered that release bile and vari- ous other enzymes and acids into the digestive tract. The digestive system is therefore primed into action before the food arrives. Giving this bitter tonic daily is an excellent holistic approach to safely treating chronic indigestion and malabsorption. If you or your animal has problems with excess gas or with foods that tend to pass through undi- gested, try using a small dose of Oregon grape before each meal. The results will probably amaze you. Oregon grape can also be used as an antibacterial in the urinary tract and is regarded by herbalists as an effective remedy for infections of the bladder, kidneys, and urethra. Again, the anti- bacterial effect of Oregon grape in the urinary tract is attributable to berber- ine, which stays effective long enough to reach deep into the body. Since most infections of the urinary tract are associ- ated with uncomfortable inflammation, combining this herb with the soothing effects of marshmallow, licorice, or plantain is a good idea. Generally, a for- mula made with one part Oregon grape to two parts of other soothing herbs is a good infection-fighting, pain-relieving approach. When combined in small proportions with echinacea, Oregon grape combats the infection directly while the immune system plays catch-up with invading pathogens. At the same time, Oregon grape helps to support the liver at its job of keeping the body clean through elim- ination of waste, a critical process of maintaining balanced body functions while the body heals. And while conven- tional antibiotic therapies tend not to discriminate between beneficial microbes and bad ones, the body is allowed to fight infection by natural mechanisms with a properly proportioned berberine-con- taining herbal support formula without compromising its own microbial war- riors. Instead, it receives a measured degree of outside support and is gently stimulated into working harder toward victory. A formula consisting of 10 per- cent Oregon grape and 90 percent echi- nacea is generally appropriate for this purpose. In addition to its liver and disinfectant benefits, berberine is known to possess mild but useful sedative qualities and may be effective as an anticonvulsive remedy. It has also been shown to help lower blood pressure and is believed to slightly elevate blood sugar levels in hypoglycemic animals. Availability: The plants are available through landscape nurseries. Oregon grape root is available in a variety of forms from herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Oregon grape is widely adaptable to gardens throughout most of North America. Tall Oregon grape (M. aquifolium) is the most common variety in commerce and is becoming popular as a landscape shrub. It is quite easy to grow from root cut- tings, seeds, or transplants. These plants are drought tolerant and winter hardy. All they essentially need is slightly acidic soil and plenty of redwood compost, but they flourish when afforded at least three hours of shade each day and a good weekly watering. Roots can be dug from mature plants anytime during the year. They can be dried and kept in plastic bags for two or three years. Alternatives and Adjuncts: In ear oils, combine with garlic and vitamin E oil. To aid in liver congestion and to improve digestion, dandelion root serves as a weak- er alternative. For Giardia and worms, Oregon grape combines with garlic. In eyewashes, Oregon grape combines espe- cially well with raspberry leaf. For urinary tract infections, marshmallow, plantain, or licorice serve as soothing adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Oregon grape should not be used in animals with acute liver disease or existing liver injuries without the supervision of a pro- fessional. It has been theorized that too much berberine may inhibit vitamin B assimilation. OXEYE DAISY Chrysanthemum Sunflower Family leucanthemum Appearance: It brings us satisfaction to tell you about useful plants that can be easily grown in any garden, but it brings us special joy to tell you about useful plants that already grow on the edges of driveways and in vacant lots. Oxeye daisy is such a plant. To the herbalist, a weed is simply a plant with attributes that have yet to be realized. When the usefulness of such plants is brought to light, people reconsider their approaches to weed control. This usually means a reduction in the use of toxic herbicides, which end up in the environment. Oxeye daisy is a wild relative of pyrethrum daisy (genus Pyrethrum), which is cultivated for its insecticidal properties. Oxeye daisy looks similar to the pyrethrum daisy; in fact at first glance it looks like any other white daisy. But close examination of this plant’s unique leaf characteristics makes it easy to differentiate from all others during any stage of its perennial growth cycle. The basal leaves of oxeye have proportionately long petioles (leaf stems) and are spoon-shaped with rounded teeth along the edges. The leaves of the upper plant lack petioles, and the flowers are typically daisylike: white with yellow centers and up to 3 inches wide. The entire plant may reach 3 feet in height. Herbs for Pets 160 o Materia Medica 161 o Habitat and Range: Oxeye daisy is a Eurasian import that is now common to roadsides and dry waste areas through- out the northern half of North America, up to about 6,000 feet in elevation. Cycle and Bloom Season: Plants bloom first in early summer, then often remain in bloom until fall. Parts Used: Leaves and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- histamine, insecticidal (used for fleas), diuretic, stops bleeding Strongest Affinities: Respiratory tract, skin Preparation: Tea, tincture, or dried powdered herb Common Uses: The leaves are recog- nized by some contemporary herbalists for their diuretic and hemostatic quali- ties, and clinical research suggests that the leaf tea may also be effective as an antihistamine medicine that slows the body’s responses to allergens while help- ing to reduce excess secretions of mucus. The flower tea is especially useful for helping to relieve seasonal hay fever characterized by sneezing and watery discharges from the nose and eyes. At the onset of symptoms, 1 tablespoon of the strong tea can be fed to dogs as part of their daily diet throughout the crisis period. Cats and other small mammals need only 1 teaspoon. Horses and other herbivores can be allowed to eat the fresh plants from their pastures, and rab- bits can be given a stem or two of the flowering plant each day. As is true of its cultivated cousins, the flowers of oxeye daisy contain use- ful amounts of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide that is useful for controlling fleas. To use oxeye daisy in this capaci- ty, make a skin rinse from the fresh chopped flowers or apply the dried flowers as a mildly effective but safe and natural flea powder. As a diuretic, oxeye daisy can increase urinary output and dilute urine that is over-concentrated, strong smelling, and too acidic, and it lends weak but measurable astringent and antimicrobial properties to inflamed uri- nary membranes. Oxeye daisy is often abundant on the margins of horse and stock trails, making it readily available as a first aid remedy for minor cuts, fly bites, and such. The fresh-leaf poultice can be applied directly to the site of injury to help stop bleeding. Combine it with one of many antimicrobial herbs that grows nearby (such as yarrow or bee balm), and you’ll have an excellent, broad-spectrum field dressing. Pyrethrum roseum Availability: A widely distributed weed, oxeye daisy is available through nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Oxeye daisy is easy to grow from seeds or transplants. It is drought tolerant, winter hardy, and adaptable to any soil. All oxeye daisy real- ly needs is full sun. Alternatives and Adjuncts: As a flea- fighting alternative, try feverfew. For sea- sonal allergies, oxeye daisy can be com- bined with or replaced by nettle. Dandelion leaf is a much more effective diuretic. Cautions and Comments: Some ani- mals may be highly allergic to this plant— test a small amount of the tea on your companion’s skin before using. If redness or any other response occurs, don’t feed it to your animal! PARSLEY Petroselinum crispum Parsley Family Appearance: There are numerous culti- vars of this familiar herb—their primary differences being leaf size and root varia- tions. The most common varieties have tightly curled leaves, whereas Italian parsley (P. crispus var. neapolitanum) has leaves that are more like those of celery. Hamburg parsley (P. crispum var. tubero- sum) has a thick turniplike taproot and fernlike leaves. All produce terminate umbel flowers, and most will grow to about 3 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Originally a native of southeast Europe and west Asia, pars- ley is now cultivated worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in midsummer Parts Used: Leaves, seeds, and roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, lowers blood pressure, nutritive, diuretic, helps reduce arthritic inflammation, promotes menstrual dis- charge, insecticidal, antimicrobial Strongest Affinities: Digestive and urinary tracts, joints Preparation: Tea, tincture, or fresh or dried herb Common Uses: Parsley is much more than a plate garnish. In fact, it is one of the most versatile medicinal plants around—it is an absolute “must have” in the home herb garden. Parsley root is known by herbalists as an excellent diuretic that is especially beneficial in the treatment of rheuma- toid conditions. For humans, it is con- sidered a specific remedy in the treat- ment of gout; it is believed to help with the elimination of uric acid that would otherwise contribute to the buildup of painful crystals in the joints. For ani- mals, parsley root is useful in cases of arthritis that are compounded or per- haps even caused by poor waste elimi- nation, a problem that is often the result of a poor diet. For these purpos- es, dogs and cats can be given a strong tea of the dried or freshly grated root (1 teaspoon of the strong tea per day for cats; 1–2 tablespoons for dogs), or a tincture can be used (1–2 milliliters per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight). Horses can be fed a few hand- fuls of the entire fresh plant (leaves, roots, and all) each day, or a cup of the dried herb daily. Parsley root is especially effective when combined with alternatives, hepatics, and anti- inflammatory herbs. Parsley leaves and stems are very nutritious, containing up to 22 percent protein and impressive amounts of vita- Herbs for Pets 162 p Materia Medica 163 p mins A, C, B1, B2, and K, as well as fiber, calcium, riboflavin, potassium, iron, magnesium, niacin, and phosphorus. This makes parsley an excellent nutritive in the treatment of anemia. The leaves also contain apiol and several other volatile oils that have antiseptic qualities, making the herb useful for urinary tract infections. And because parsley is a diuretic, it may help boost kidney func- tion in cases of noninflammatory, early- onset renal failure. Apiol also has a stim- ulant and strengthening effect on intes- tinal and uterine muscles, making it suit- able for improving uterine muscle tone after a difficult pregnancy. In the diges- tive tract, this tonic activity combines with parsley’s carminative properties, making it effective in the treatment of flatulent dyspepsia and colic. Perhaps the best way to use parsley leaf for gastric or urinary disorders or for its nutritional qualities is to juice it. If you don’t have a vegetable juicer, pack an electric blender halfway full with fresh leaves and add just enough water to liq- uefy the leaves into a dark green soup. The juice, or “blender soup,” can be fed directly to an animal with an empty stomach (the best option) or added to your companion’s drinking water (sec- ond best) or food (the last resort)—1 tea- spoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. The juice (or a few drops of the leaf tincture) also serves as an excel- lent breath freshener. Availability: Plants are available through nurseries. The herb is also available in various forms through health food and herb retailers everywhere. Propagation and Harvest: Parsley is easy to grow from seed or transplants. If given rich, well-drained soil, it will return year after year. If allowed to go to seed, it will sprout up all over the garden. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For rheum- atoid conditions, shepherd’s purse serves as an effective substitute. For urinary infec- tions, consider corn silk, couch grass, echi- nacea, uva ursi, and horsetail as alterna- tives or adjuncts. For colic and other diges- tive disorders, fennel, dill, slippery elm, plantain, marshmallow, cleavers, and licorice should all be investigated. Raspberry leaf or nettle serves as alterna- tive uterine tonics or nutritives. Cautions and Comments: Parsley, in dried, fresh, or tea form is very safe. However, highly concentrated prepara- tions of the seed, such as parsley essen- tial oil, are rich in volatile oils that can be absorbed into the placenta, so don’t use the essential oil internally or externally during an animal’s pregnancy. While it is thought to aid the healing process after birthing, it may reduce lactation and Petroselinum crispum should be used conservatively in nursing mothers. Parsley should not be used if inflammation of the kidneys exists. Parsley seeds contain the highest con- centration of volatile oils, including a considerable amount of myristicin. Myristicin can have strong hypotensive and hallucinogenic effects, especially in cats, and may cause liver damage or photosensitivity if ingested in large enough quantities. Although such instances are rare, and it’s unlikely that an animal could eat enough parsley seed to cause such problems, it’s best to be safe by using only parsley leaves, stems, and roots, which contain much lower concentrations of myristicin. PLANTAIN Plantago sp. Plantain Family Appearance: Common plantain (Plant- ago major) is characterized by its low-grow- ing rosette of broad leaves and its rather drab but distinctive flower cluster. The stur- dy succulent leaves are on proportionately long petioles and have distinct parallel veins that contain strong fibers. Flowers are small and inconspicuous, borne in tightly arranged sausage-shaped spikes atop leaf- less stalks that reach well above the rest of the plant. Ten or more species of the Plantago genus inhabit western North America, with common plantain by far the most widespread and abundant. Habitat and Range: Common plan- tain is frequently found in high impact areas, growing in the center of dirt roads, walkways, and even the cracks in highways. It is widespread throughout most of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or perennial that blooms March through August Parts Used: All parts of the plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Lubri- cates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; emollient; astringent; anti- inflammatory; stops bleeding Strongest Affinities: Digestive and uri- nary tracts, skin Preparation: Tincture, tea, poultice, or dried seed husks Common Uses: Plantain is one of many useful plants that have been forgotten by virtue of its abundance and its reputation as a weed. Many of us step on it while en route to the vegetable garden, unaware that it may be more nutritious than the vegetables we tend. Plantain is high in vitamins C, A, and K. In essence, plantain can be used in the same ways as slippery elm. The mucilagi- nous and astringent qualities of plantain make it an excellent remedy for reducing inflammations inside and on the body. The aucubin and saponin constituents of plantain have been shown to have anti- bacterial properties, especially against Micrococcus flavus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilus. All of these activities combine to make plantain useful in a wide range of urinary, digestive, and res- piratory ailments. In the urinary tract, plantain can help stop minor bleeding, reduce inflamma- tion, and relieve pain that is secondary to bacterial infection or the passing of small stones (gravel). In the digestive tract, plantain relieves diarrhea and the symptoms of various types of inflamma- tory bowel disease. Its lubricating prop- erties and anti-inflammatory activities make it useful for treating irritations of the stomach and intestinal tract that occur when an animal eats something that is difficult to pass such as pine Herbs for Pets 164 p Materia Medica 165 p needles, a bottle cap, or a brand-new sequined handbag. Plantago psyllium is widely known for its seeds and husks, which are used as an effective laxative and a source of dietary fiber. In the upper respiratory tract, plantain helps soothe raspy coughs such as those caused by inhaled dust or canine tra- cheobronchitis (kennel cough). Plantain is best used fresh. If you have an electric juicer, liquefy the entire plant, roots and all. Otherwise, chop the washed plants as finely as you can, pack them loosely into a blender, add just enough warm water to cover the herb, and blend the mixture into a dark-green gooey soup. Don’t use boil- ing water because it destroys hydrolytic enzymes that have antibacterial proper- ties. You might end up with a tangle of the strong leaf fibers wrapped around the blades of your machine—this is nor- mal. Strain the liquid through a sieve and refrigerate it in a sealed glass jar until you need it. It will keep for about two weeks in a very cold refrigerator. To use the juice for internal problems, 1 teaspoon can be fed for each 20 pounds of a dog’s body weight, once or twice daily. Cats can take up to a tea- spoon of the juice twice daily. It’s best to administer the juice before a meal and with as little added water as possi- ble. If this isn’t possible, the juice can be added to your companion’s food. For colic, the removal of sand in the diges- tive tract, and other digestive problems in horses or other large animals, a hand- ful or two of the fresh plants can be fed as part of a daily diet. A poultice of plantain is one of the best topical first aid remedies for insect bites, stings, minor burns, and site-spe- cific contact dermatitis (such as minor bouts with stinging nettle). An oil infu- sion or salve of the fresh or dried plant can be used for the same purposes. Availability: A widely distributed weed. The husks of P. psyllium are available through any respectable health food store, and several psyllium products are now being produced specifically for use in animals. The seeds of several varieties can be purchased through specialty catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Plantain is easy to grow—all it needs is ample water during its germination. Sow the tiny seeds as sparsely as you can under 1⁄8 inch of soil, and keep them wet until they sprout. The plants can be harvested and used anytime, but the mature sec- ond-year and older plants make the best medicine. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Plantain can be used as a substitute for slippery elm, a hardwood tree that is being over- Plantago major harvested for its medicinal inner bark. Marshmallow root contains far more mucilage than plantain does, and it serves as a more effective alternative in cases in which digestive or urinary tract lubrication is needed. In situations in which the astringency and mucilage content of plantain are not enough to bring relief to urinary irritations, try com- bining marshmallow with a stronger astringent such as uva ursi or rose bark. Cautions and Comments: Side effects are rare with this plant, but some ani- mals may be allergic to it. If your com- panion is predisposed to plant allergies, test for sensitivity by applying a small amount to the skin. If no reaction occurs, proceed with a small internal dose (a few drops), and watch for sneezing, watery eyes, or other signs of allergic response. RASPBERRY Rubus sp. Rose Family Appearance: Raspberries are generally categorized by color—red or black. Leaf and stem characteristics vary between species of this widespread genus of shrubs. Most have divided leaves and five-petal flowers that range from white to crimson in color. The plants are gener- ally found as tangled masses of thorny trailing biennial stems that yield a tasty reward to those brave enough to reach the choicest berries. All species are med- icinally useful. Habitat and Range: As one travels northward through the Rocky Mountains and the coastal states of the West, the diversity of species and the number of roadside bramble patches encountered progressively increases. Many species of Rubus are regarded as invasive weeds. They are common and often abundant inhabitants of pastures, roadside ditches, and riparian habitats. This genus often cross-pollinates, making exact identifica- tion of species difficult in many areas. And many species have escaped cultiva- tion, making it anybody’s guess where one of these plants will pop up next. Red raspberry (R. idaeus—illustrated) is one of the most common indigenous species found throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennials that bloom and produce fruit from second-year plants, known as canes Parts Used: Dried leaves and, of course, the delicious fruit Primary Medicinal Activities: Astringent, strengthens the uterus (uterotonic), nutritive, diuretic, laxative, mild sedative Strongest Affinities: Female repro- ductive system, eyes, skin Preparation: Infusion, poultice, or tincture Common Uses: Raspberry leaf is a safe and gentle medicinal food. Aside from its nutritional value (it is especially high in vitamin C), raspberry leaf tea has mild astringent qualities that make it useful for a wide variety of remedial and tonic therapies. Taken internally, the tea is use- ful for treating minor digestive tract inflammations and can be used as a rem- edy for mild cases of diarrhea. In such instances, a strong infusion can be fed at a dose of 2 ounces per 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight (or 1 ounce for cats), twice daily as needed for relief. Alternatively, the dried leaf can be used—1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, sprinkled onto food daily. For bleeding or inflamed gums, the powdered leaf can be applied directly to Herbs for Pets 166 r Materia Medica 167 r the site of the problem, or the tea can be applied to the gums with a cotton swab. Traditionally, the leaf tea is perhaps the most widely used “female tonic” in existence. It acts to improve the tone and elasticity of smooth muscle tissues in and around the uterus. It is useful as a prepregnancy tonic and in pregnant or postpartum dogs, cats, horses, and other animals during the final weeks of preg- nancy. The dried leaf can be sprinkled onto your animal’s food (at the previous- ly mentioned doses) as a daily tonic, or it can be fed as a tea. Make the tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of the dried leaf (in a tea ball) in 8 ounces of hot water. The tea can be added to your animal’s drinking water until the water is notice- ably colored. The animal can then drink at will. Raspberry leaf is especially beneficial in the form of a saline eyewash for symp- tomatic relief of conjunctivitis. To make an eyewash, infuse 1 teaspoon of dried raspberry leaf in 8 ounces of hot distilled water. Allow the tea to cool, strain it through a coffee filter, then combine it with enough sterile saline solution to produce a slightly tinted solution. The cooled full-strength tea can also be used as a soothing scalp or skin rinse— its astringency helps to relieve minor itchiness. Availability: Raspberry leaf is available at health food stores. The canes are avail- able through most nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Raspberries are easy to grow. Transplanted canes pro- duce an abundance of leaves, and they produce their first fruit during their sec- ond year of growth and every year there- after. The plants like moist, potassium- rich soil and full sun. Harvest the leaves just before the plants bloom in spring or early summer. Dry them on a clean non- metallic surface until they are crispy dry. The dried leaves can be stored in plastic bags for a year or more. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Raspberry serves as a less-threatened substitute for eyebright (Euphrasia spp.), a plant that is currently at risk of disappearing because of overharvest. The leaves of strawberry (Fragaria spp.) can be used as a substi- tute for raspberry leaf. As a female tonic, nettle leaf tea serves as a better substi- tute because it contains a much richer array of vital nutrients. Nettle can also be used in eye and skin washes. For con- junctivitis or inflammation of the mouth that is secondary to bacterial or fungal infection, raspberry leaf combines well with Oregon grape and echinacea. If the problem appears to be of viral origin, mullein leaf or Saint-John’s-wort may serve as an effective adjunct. For diarrhea Rubus idaeus and internal bleeding, stronger alterna- tives include uva ursi, horsetail, plantain, and cayenne. Cautions and Comments: Never use raspberry leaves that are not completely dry. As the leaves wilt, they temporarily develop toxins that can be nauseating to your animal. Despite old claims of raspberry leaf causing uterine contractions, no quali- fied reports of toxicity have been record- ed for this herb. RED CLOVER Trifolium pratense Pea Family Appearance: Red clover was intro- duced to the U.S. from Europe as a feed crop for livestock and has since escaped cultivation to make itself at home throughout North America. It is charac- terized by the predominantly three- lobed leaves of the Trifolium genus, of which dozens of species and cultivars are distributed throughout the West. The differences among these many species may be minute, and positive identifica- tion of a specific Trifolium sp. can be challenging. First, the identification of red clover can begin by recognizing its red, globe-shaped flowers and its soft, hairy stems. Second, we can see that the flower stems (pedicels) are shorter in length than each of the leaf stems (peti- oles). And finally, red clover has a small carrotlike taproot, whereas many clovers have horizontally creeping roots systems (rhizomes). If all of this fails to answer the question of identity, cheat—find some red clover that has been cultivated and formulate personalized notes for future reference. Habitat and Range: Red clover is wide- spread in cultivated fields, road margins, gardens, and other disturbed areas where the plant has been introduced largely through agricultural activities. Cycle and Bloom Season: A short-lived perennial that blooms in early summer Parts Used: Flowering tops Primary Medicinal Activities: Helps with blood cleansing, diuretic, expecto- rant, tonic, antispasmodic, nutritive, antitumor, effects estrogen production in the body (estrogenic) Strongest Affinities: Liver, blood, and skin Preparation: Tea, dried or fresh herb, or tincture Common Uses: Although traditionally red clover has been used and highly acclaimed as a blood-purifying alterative and anticancer agent for hundreds, per- haps thousands, of years, few scientific studies have been conducted to substan- tiate these claims. Regardless, thousands of herbalists and an equal number of people who have witnessed red clover’s potential as a healing agent and preven- tative seem to know something. At the root of red clover’s attributes is an impressive array of protein, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and vitamin C and B complex. All of these nutrients are joined with a complex assortment of medicinal- ly active chemical compounds. In the mind of a holistically oriented herbalist, all of these components synergistically amount to an excellent remedy for pso- riasis, eczema, and other skin disorders, especially those believed to be secondary to excess waste materials in the blood- stream. For such disorders, red clover may be used internally or externally. Internally, a flower tea or tincture gently Herbs for Pets 168 r Materia Medica 169 R stimulates the liver and gallbladder to help optimize digestion and replenish the blood. Externally, a cooled tea or poultice can be applied to flaky dry, itchy skin for symptomatic relief. Added to an animal’s daily diet as a preventive meas- ure, you can give a pinch of dried red clover to a dog; a tinier pinch to a cat; and a handful to horses, llamas, and sheep. A rabbit can be fed a flower or two a day, and for other animals, as with any herb, moderation is the single-word golden rule. In horses, red clover is sometimes fed to speed recovery from viral infections of the respiratory tract, particularly when a persistent cough or excessive secretion of thick mucus from inflamed mucous mem- branes (catarrh) seem to be slowing the healing process by adding stress to a run- down animal. Feed 1⁄2–2 cups of the flower heads daily as part of the animal’s feed. If tea is a better option, 3 or 4 heaping tablespoons of the dried flowers steeped in a pint of water can be fed daily. Much of red clover’s reputation as an anticancer herb stems from its inclusion in the famed Hoxsey Formula and the still popular Essiac Formula, although skeptics argue that the effectiveness of these formulas are without validation. Both of these formulas have been used extensively during the past seventy-five years, and many cancer sufferers, practi- tioners, and pet owners have claimed near-miraculous results from them. In addition to these formulas, red clover is often used by itself—again with many favorable claims. As mentioned, scientif- ic evidence to support these claims is scarce but certainly exists. In 1988, a study published in The Journal of Cancer Research indicated that the anticancer activity of red clover may in fact be a sci- entific reality. Specifically, it was found that the flavonoid constituents in red clover blossoms inhibit the harmful activ- ities of a carcinogenic substance called benzopyrene, a compound present in charbroiled foods. In an earlier 1970 study that was published in the same journal, the flavonoid quercetin found in red clover was shown to prevent ben- zopyrene from becoming active in the liver and small intestines. While these studies fall short of identifying the breadth of red clover’s activity against various other carcinogens, they certain- ly indicate that further research is war- ranted and add credibility to what holistic practitioners have been telling us all along. In animals with cancerous lesions of the skin or extremities, a poultice of red clover flowers can be applied in the form of a compress for several hours each day until the animal’s condition (hopefully) improves. Internal doses of the flower tea or tincture can be used in dogs, cats, Trifolium pratense horses, and other animals as well. In the fight against cancer, anything that can be applied safely and without contribut- ing stress to an already stressed body is certainly worth a try. In our minds, red clover is at the top of the list. Availability: Seed catalogs, feed stores, health food stores, and other herb retailers Propagation and Harvest: If you have rich, moist soil and a section of gar- den you wish to delegate to the spread- ing, strong-rooted nature of this plant, red clover can be easily propagated from seed. Harvest the flowers during dry weather in early summer. Use them fresh or dry them indoors on a piece of clean paper. The dried flowers keep for a year if properly stored. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For skin problems that are secondary to poor liver metabolism or excessive systemic waste, red clover combines well with yel- low dock, alfalfa, burdock, dandelion root, and nettle. Cautions and Comments: When properly used, red clover is a safe herb, but, as is true for many plants, its use does demand some attention and respect. First, do not use red clover for animals with clotting disorders or in the presence of internal or external bleed- ing. This plant contains the compound coumarin, which is cited in many toxi- cology texts as having blood-thinning qualities. However, recent studies sug- gest that the coumarin alone do not really possess blood-thinning proper- ties. Instead, it is now thought that blood-thinning properties may only occur when certain molds or fungi develop on the herb as result of improper drying. Red clover is also known to contain estrogenic isoflavone constituents that may prove toxic to livestock and other animals if fed in large quantities. Cases of acute skin and digestive disorders have been reported in horses, sheep, cattle, and other ani- mals who have been allowed to ex- cessively overgraze on fresh red clover. Red clover also possesses some phyto- estrogenic principles that contraindi- cate this herb’s use in pregnant or lactating animals. ROSE Rosa spp. Rose Family Appearance: Most people are familiar with roses. Hundreds of cultivars adorn flower beds to please the senses and stir the emotions of millions of people worldwide. In addition to the healing power of their beauty, all roses are med- icinally useful. The wild species (of which there are dozens in North America) offer the best-tasting, most nutritional hips. Wild roses look and smell very much like their domesticated counterparts except that they have smaller flowers and leaves. Characterized by their white-to- pink (sometimes yellow), five-petaled flowers, thorny stems, and bright red to purplish fruit (hips), these plants repre- sent a safe, easy-to-identify, delightful introduction to nature’s pantry and apothecary. Habitat and Range: Wild roses like con- sistently moist soil and are often found standing in dense thickets at road mar- gins, in irrigation ditches, and especially as the “defensive edge” of riparian habi- tats up to about 6,000 feet in elevation. Several species are native throughout North America. Wood’s rose (Rosa wood- sii) represents one of the most widespread pink-flowered species to be found in west- ern North America. Multiflora rose (R. Herbs for Pets 170 r Materia Medica 171 r multiflora) grows profusely throughout the midwestern U.S. and eastern Canada, where it forms dense thickets and is often considered a troublesome weed. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms June through August Parts Used: Hips, flower petals, leaves, stems, and bark Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutri- tive, astringent, bacteriostatic Strongest Affinities: Digestive system, urinary tract, skin Preparation: Fresh or dried hips, petals, leaves, and bark; tincture, tea, or decoction Common Uses: When we think of roses as medicine, we tend to remem- ber reading “Vitamin C with Rose Hips” on product labels. But actually, the nutritive value of rose hips repre- sents only a small fraction of the heal- ing attributes this plant has to offer. Native Americans used all parts of Rosa spp. in a wide variety of applica- tions. The seeds were cooked and ingested for relief from muscular pains. The roots were used as a general pur- pose astringent for diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and to stop bleeding. The flower petals were employed as a bacteriostatic protective bandage on burns and minor wounds and as a treatment for colic and heart- burn. A poultice of the leaves was used for insect stings and bites. All of these uses can be safely applied to animals. Each part of a rose plant represents a different level of astringency. The flower petals are mildly to moderately astringent and can be made into a sweet-smelling rinse for animals with dry, itchy skin. Petal tea is also useful for mild to moderate cases of colic and diarrhea or for minor irritations of the mouth and stomach. Making a tea is simple—infuse a handful of fresh petals in a cup of near-boiling water. After the tea has cooled, it can be fed to dogs and cats at a dose of 1 table- spoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, as needed. If necessary it can be added to your companion’s drinking water. The cooled and strained tea is also useful as an anti- inflammatory eyewash, especially in cases where redness and eye rubbing is attributable to dust or other environ- mental irritants. The leaves are stronger than the flower petals and can be decocted for use as a rinse for contact dermatitis or inflamed fleabites or fly bites. Internally, the leaf decoction is useful Rosa woodsii for cystitis and acute digestive tract inflammations that may be secondary to bacterial or parasitic infection. A typical dose is a 1⁄2 teaspoon for each 30 pounds of the animal’s weight, once or twice daily, for no longer than four days. The bark and stems offer the strongest astringency and may be use- ful for acute cases of urinary or diges- tive tract inflammation that involve labored or painful urination, gushing diarrhea, or minor bleeding. Care must be taken to avoid feeding sharp rose thorns to your companion. The dose is the same as for a leaf decoction, but the maximum duration of use is short- er—the bark and stem decoction should not be used internally for more than two days. Rose hips are high in vitamin C and serve as a tasty and nutritious treat for animals. Our dogs harvest and eat them as trail snacks! The whole hip can be fed either fresh or dried. Dried hips can be ground in an electric coffee grinder and added to your compan- ion’s food as a nutritional supplement. Dogs and cats can be fed 1⁄2–1 tea- spoon of the ground hips per cup of food. Horses and other large herbi- vores can be fed a handful or two each day. Because of the ascorbic acid con- tent, too much rose hip causes stom- ach upset or diarrhea. If this happens, cut back on the amount in the daily feedings. Availability: Hundreds of rose vari- eties are available through nurseries. The best are the smaller-flowered wild species that are available through nurs- eries that specialize in native plants. Propagation and Harvest: Roses are easy to grow. They prosper in moist, slightly acidic soil. Leaves and flowers can be harvested any time as long as they look healthy. The hips are harvested in the fall after they turn bright red but before they shrivel. The hips can be dried indoors on a clean piece of paper. They keep for several years if stored in a glass jar and kept away from direct sunlight. Don’t grind the hips until you need them, otherwise you greatly shorten their shelf life. Harvest the stem bark when you prune your roses each year. Most domesticated varieties have large thorns that can be snapped off. If this isn’t possible, you can use the small thornless end stems and peduncles (the stem part just beneath the flow- ers and hips). The stems can be cut into small segments with pruning clippers or chopped with a sharp knife. They can then be decocted, just like the bark. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Rasp- berry leaf, nettle, and chamomile serve as alternatives where a mild urinary or digestive astringent is indicated. For acute cystitis or colic, rose leaf or bark combines with marshmallow, licorice, or slippery elm. Skin rinse alternatives include calendula, chamomile, uva ursi, and juniper. For conjunctivitis, raspberry leaf serves as a replacement, and Oregon grape serves as an excellent antimicro- bial adjunct. Cautions and Comments: The high tannin content in the bark can irritate the urinary tract and kidneys and can trigger uterine contractions, therefore rose bark is best avoided in pregnant animals or those with preexisting kid- ney problems. Internal use should be limited to acute disorders and short- term therapies (two days or less). Call your veterinarian immediately if inter- nal bleeding is evident, diarrhea is per- sistent, or urination is labored. Herbs for Pets 172 r Materia Medica 173 r ROSEMARY Rosmarinus officinalis Mint Family Appearance: A creeping or erect shrub that can grow to 6 feet tall, rosemary is characterized by its piney fragrance; nar- row, leathery, and densely arranged opposite leaves; and white, pink, or blue 3⁄8-inch-long flowers. Habitat and Range: Rosemary is a native of the Mediterranean region, but several cultivars of rosemary are grown worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms anytime from early spring to late summer, depending on climate Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Tonic, antidepressant, stimulant, analgesic, expels intestinal gas, antispasmodic, pro- motes menstrual discharge, astringent, antioxidant, antimicrobial, insect repellent Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, digestive tract, circulatory system, respi- ratory tract, and skin Preparation: Tea, tincture Common Uses: Rosemary is an ex- tremely useful herb. At the top of its list of medicinal attributes are nervine, antidepressant, antispasmodic, and carminative properties that combine to make rosemary an excellent remedy for flatulent dyspepsia and other digestive problems that are secondary to general nervousness, excitability, or irritability. Adding to rosemary’s utility as a calm- ing agent are borneol and an assort- ment of volatile oils that are known to have antispasmodic effects upon the heart and other smooth muscles of the body. These activities not only help moderate cardiac arrhythmia but also serve to strengthen heart function, making rosemary especially beneficial in situations where an animal is recov- ering from a fearful or traumatic expe- rience, or even shock. The rosmarinic acid contained in the plant is believed to have painkilling properties. In any of the aforementioned instances, about 1⁄8 teaspoon (0.5 milliliter) of tincture can be given orally as a starting dose for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, up to three times daily. Horses and other large herbivores can be fed a handful of the fresh stems and leaves daily. In addition to its uses as a calming agent, rosemary can be employed as a general cardiovascular tonic, where it not only serves to moderate and Rosmarinus officinalis improve heart function but also helps to strengthen capillary structures. And when added to your companion’s food, rosemary helps mask the flavor of less- palatable herbs and serves as a natural barrier against food-borne bacteria. The ursolic acid and carnisol con- stituents of rosemary have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that are effective against Pseudomonas fluo- rescens, Rhodoturula glutinius, and other pathogens that contribute to food spoilage. In fact, rosemary’s effec- tiveness is comparable to that of the more harmful chemical preservatives BHA or BHT. To use rosemary as a pre- servative, add 1⁄4 teaspoon of powdered herb to each pound of a dog’s or cat’s homemade diet. Rosemary also has excellent antimi- crobial properties inside or on your companion’s body. Scientific studies have shown that it is active against var- ious types of fungi, as well as numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bac- teria, including Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, and corynebacteria.6 This makes rosemary useful in antibacterial skin and eye rinses; for minor cuts and burns; and for fighting infections of the mouth, throat, and urinary and diges- tive tracts. Ten drops of rosemary essential oil can be diluted with 1 ounce of apricot kernel or almond oil for topical use in the treatment of sprains, arthritic joints, sciatica, and neuralgia. Rubbed into the skin at the site of discomfort, the oil stimulates capillary circulation and helps to relieve muscular and nerve pain. Do not use undiluted rosemary oil internally or externally, though, because it is strong and can cause immediate irritation. The oil is con- traindicated for animals who have any type of seizure disorder. Availability: Rosemary plants are available through nurseries. The dried or fresh herb is available at grocery and health food stores. Propagation and Harvest: Rose- mary is easy to grow from transplants and can be kept as a houseplant in areas where winters are severe. It’s not particular about soil and does best in full sun. In the southern and West Coast portions of the U.S., rosemary is often seen as a hedge-forming land- scape shrub, which, unfortunately, is unheard of in colder climates. Rosemary can be started from seed, but germination percentages are poor and the seedlings grow slowly. Rosemary can be harvested anytime, but the leaves’ medicinal qualities are strongest in late summer. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For depressive disorders or nervousness, rosemary can be combined with skull- cap or oatstraw. If such a problem is causing digestive disorders, such as vomiting, flatulence, and colic, look toward fennel, dill, flaxseed, parsley, or chamomile as an adjunct. For use as an antimicrobial, rosemary is strength- ened by Oregon grape. For topical first aid, rosemary oil combines with arnica, Saint-John’s-wort, cayenne, aloe, calendula, or willow bark. For itchy skin and fleas, rosemary and cal- endula combine as a soothing, healing flea-repellent rinse. Cautions and Comments: In horses, the volatile oils of rosemary may be detectable in a blood sample; is possible that it may be considered a “prohibited substance” under Jocky Club or other horse show rules. Otherwise, rosemary is a very safe herb. Herbs for Pets 174 r Materia Medica 175 s SAGE Salvia officinalis Mint Family Appearance: Over eight hundred species of Salvia exist worldwide, and most are medicinally useful. Most gar- deners and Epicureans are familiar with S. officinalis, common garden sage. Many of the wild species share the same unique “pebbled” leaf texture and have a similar but much stronger flavor and aroma. Flowers of the Salvia genus range from white to deep purple. It’s important to know that many wild plants with a sagelike fragrance, or even a common name that contains the word sage are unrelated to the sage we use in the kitchen. One example is sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), a member of the sunflower family that smells like sage but can be harmful if used internally. Given the availability and effectiveness of culi- nary sage, there’s little reason to harvest wild sage for your companion. If, howev- er, you do opt to use a wild sage, learn its Latin name first. If the plant you are considering isn’t a Salvia, then it’s a dif- ferent medicine as well. Habitat and Range: Common sage is a native of the Mediterranean region. Dozens of cultivars have been developed and are farmed throughout the world. In the coastal canyons of southern California, native species such as white sage (S. apiana), black sage (S. mellifera), Munz’s sage (S. munzii), and purple sage (S. leucophylla) often stand as the pre- dominant flora, growing in dense stands of 2- to 6-foot-high shrubs that may cover the landscape for miles. As one travels north or east, the distribution of Salvia species becomes more scattered and less varied, and the plants tend to be small and less predominant. In the deserts of eastern Washington and Oregon, grayball sage (S. dorrii) brings the dry, brushy landscape alive with vibrant hues of purple. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennials that bloom in early to late spring Parts Used: Leaves, small stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- septic, astringent, antispasmodic, expels intestinal gas, inhibits sweating (is an antihydrotic) Strongest Affinities: Mouth, digestive tract, skin Preparation: Tea or tincture Common Uses: Sage is an excellent remedy for infections or ulcerations of Salvia leucophylla the mouth, skin, or digestive tract. Most of its antimicrobial activity is attributable to its content of thujone, a volatile oil that is effective against E. coli, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella ozanae, Bacillus subtillis, and various fungi— namely Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida pseudotropicalis, Torulopsis glab- rata, and Cryptococcus neoformans. A strong sage tea or tincture is useful for treating and preventing gingivitis as well as infection that is secondary to injury or dental surgery. For bacterial or fungal infections of the throat and digestive tract, sage serves as a safe and effective antibiotic and helps to expel gas and ease gastric cramping. Horses and other large herbivores can be fed a handful or two of the fresh leaves or a cup of dried leaves in their daily food ration as a treat- ment for colic and flatulence that is sec- ondary to bacterial or fungal infection. For smaller animals, the tea can be added to drinking water, or a tincture can be administered directly by mouth. If you choose to make tea, steep 1 table- spoon of the dried leaves in a cup of near-boiling water. Stir the mixture fre- quently until it has cooled to lukewarm. Strain out the plant material but don’t discard it if you’re treating a localized infection or ulcer. It can be used as a poultice by directly applying it to an affected area. The tea can be sweetened with honey (which has its own healing properties) and fed at a rate of 1 fluid ounce per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, two or three times daily. If you choose to use a tincture, a good starting dose is 0.5–1.0 milliliter per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily. In the form of a rinse, poultice, or fomentation, sage tea is useful for treat- ing bacterial or fungal infections of the skin, including ringworm. In such instances, thoroughly soak your com- panion with the cooled tea once or twice daily. The tea is also a safe and natural disinfectant for turtle or lizard enclosures and may be combined with liquid soap for use as a hand wash after handling animals who may carry salmonella. Availability: Fresh or dried sage is avail- able at food stores. The plants are avail- able at most nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Sage is an easy-to-grow “must have” for the home herb gardener. It likes heavy, slightly acid soil and full sun. It is drought resistant and winter hardy, but in regions where temperatures reach below –10° F, a thick fall mulch is required. Collect the leaves and small stems during midday, when the volatile oils are most concentrated in the leaves, and preferably when the plants are just beginning to bloom. The best way to dry sage is to tie the leaves into small bundles and hang them indoors. When the leaves are crunchy dry, they are ready to store in an airtight glass jar away from sunlight. Properly stored, the herb keeps for two or three years—as long as it smells strong, it’s still good medicine. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For mouth infections, thyme, rosemary, and bee balm are also effective, and consider Oregon grape and myrrh as strong adjuncts or alternatives. For digestive problems, sage combines with Oregon grape, licorice, fennel, parsley, dill, or marshmallow. For infec- tions of the skin, calendula, aloe, chap- arral, chamomile, rosemary, and uva ursi all deserve some study. Cautions and Comments: The undi- luted essential oil of sage can cause skin irritation and should not be given inter- nally. Sage is said to inhibit lactation. Herbs for Pets 176 s Materia Medica 177 s SAINT-JOHN’S-WORT Hypericum perforatum Saint-John’s-Wort Family Appearance: Saint-John’s-wort is a stur- dy perennial weed distinguished by its yellow five-petaled flowers and its small (up to 3⁄4 inch long) narrowly lance- shaped to elliptical leaves. The flowers and leaves are covered with tiny purplish black dots, each containing hypericin, a medicinally active compound that is often visible as a red stain on the skin after rubbing the foliage between one’s fingertips. Saint-John’s-wort varies in size among species, but all of them are simi- lar in appearance. The largest and most widespread species, Hypericum perfora- tum, may reach 32 inches in height, whereas H. anagalloides (bog Saint- John’s-wort), one of the smallest species, grows in mats seldom exceeding 4 inch- es in height. Habitat and Range: Habitat varies according to species, but generally the larger species prefer dry to moist open hillsides up to about 6,000 feet in eleva- tion, whereas higher elevations and wet- ter habitats tend to yield the smaller species. In the Pacific Northwest, H. per- foratum and H. formosum are common and often profuse on open range lands at foothill elevations, where they are considered noxious weeds because of their alleged toxicity to livestock. Saint- John’s-wort is a European import that now ranges throughout the Pacific and Rocky Mountain states and in isolated stands through the central and eastern portions of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that is sometimes referred to as Fourth of July flower, Saint-John’s-wort usually blooms from early July through August. Parts Used: The top 12 inches of the flowering plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Wound healing, moderates nerve transmissions (nervine), antiseptic, antiviral, antide- pressive, immunostimulant. Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, skin Preparation: Tea, tincture, or topical preparation of the fresh herb Common Uses: It’s amazing how our opinions can change by simply looking closer at what we take for granted. Saint- John’s-wort has long been regarded as an invasive weed in the western portions of the U.S. Until recently, people wanted to eradicate this plant from the range lands on which it so successfully flourish- es, competes with native plants, and Hypericum perforatum threatens grazing livestock with possible toxic side effects. But now, in light of extensive scientific research, Saint- John’s-wort has been promoted from the status of a universally hated weed to that of a valued medicine that offers a wealth of curative power. Our awareness of Saint-John’s-wort’s benefits comes in the midst of an enormous health care crisis and forces us to reevaluate our short- sighted approaches to plants we igno- rantly view as our enemies. As well as giving us a valuable opportunity to reconsider the true values in our sur- roundings, Saint-John’s-wort offers new hope in the treatment of AIDS, chronic depression, nervous system disorders, and various forms of herpes virus. A plant is seen as a weed only when we cannot recognize its useful purpose. Because of the lesson we’ve learned from Saint- John’s-wort, we are forced to wonder about the usefulness of all plants and to consider the price we may be paying when we choose to eradicate certain plants in favor of agricultural economics. Saint-John’s-wort has received a great deal of media attention for its demon- strated ability to act as an antidepressant in both humans and animals. Literally hundreds of recent scientific studies have confirmed that it may act as a safe, effec- tive, and natural alternative to antide- pressant drugs. In Germany and other European countries, where the most research is being conducted on Saint- John’s-wort and its derivatives, the plant has been deemed safe and effective by the government, and millions of people are using the plant daily to treat chronic depression without ill side effects. In fact, one pharmaceutical brand of Saint- John’s-wort is being prescribed in Germany at a rate of seven to one over the popular antidepressant drug Prozac. And in the U.S., an increasing number of holistic veterinarians are using the herb to treat separation anxiety and aggres- sion disorders in dogs and cats. Contrary to popular belief, however, Saint-John’s- wort does not offer a neatly packaged holistic solution to depressive disorders, especially not for animals. The antidepressive qualities of Saint- John’s-wort represent only a small portion of what this plant has to offer. Saint- John’s-wort also has antiviral, vulnerary (wound and burn healing), nerve tonic, and antibacterial activities that are unpar- alleled by any other herb. And while a great deal of research and marketing has been focused on the hypericin con- stituents (a red pigment contained within tiny glands that dot the flower petals and leaves of the plant) of Saint-John’s-wort, this herb contains dozens of other chemi- cal compounds that have been shown to possess a tremendous range of healing actions. These compounds include vari- ous essential oils, flavonoids, tannins, and phytosterol constituents—all of which combine to make Saint-John’s-wort active against a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, and even viruses. For the treatment of burns and wounds, Saint-John’s-wort helps speed the healing process while reducing pain at the site of injury. As an antibiotic, preparations of Saint-John’s-wort ex- tract have been shown to be as effective as many of their pharmaceutical coun- terparts, including sulfonamides, a group of general-use antibiotics com- monly prescribed for treatment of bac- terial infections in dogs, cats, horses, and a wide variety of other animals. Saint-John’s-wort is especially useful in instances where soft tissues, joints, or nerve endings have been crushed, crimped, or bruised, a condition that may occur when a cattle dog is stomped or kicked or when a cat expends another of her nine lives in a run-in with an automobile. For first aid Herbs for Pets 178 s Materia Medica 179 s purposes, Saint-John’s-wort can be applied directly to the site of injury in the form of a salve, a tincture, or an oil infusion, or the tincture can be admin- istered internally. We would probably opt to do both in the described circum- stances as the topical application helps to prevent infection and speed healing, while the phytosterol and flavonoid constituents of the internal dose help with nerve pain and repair. Giving 12 drops of the tincture per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, administered twice daily, is a good starting point in terms of internal dosage. Saint-John’s-wort offers a great deal of promise in the treatment of various forms of viral and retroviral infections, including AIDS, FIV, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, herpes, and viral hepatitis (particularly in ducks and other fowl). In essence, Saint-John’s-wort inhibits repro- duction of these viruses, especially if the herb is administered during the earliest stages of disease. In AIDS research, the hope is that Saint-John’s-wort will prove to slow the progression of the HIV virus. So far studies have been promising, but it’s too early to define the depth of Saint-John’s-wort’s role in this capacity. Regardless, its use in fighting human or feline AIDS is worth a serious try. Saint-John’s-wort extract may be effective as a preventive measure in dogs who have been exposed to a potentially fatal canine herpes viral infection or in cats, horses, or other animals suffering from a herpes virus. The point to remem- ber is that Saint-John’s-wort will not cure the animal of herpes, but it may help keep the virus in check. In our experi- ence with people who suffer from her- pes, simultaneous internal and external applications of Saint-John’s-wort extract expedites remission of the virus and often helps to lengthen the comfortable period between outbreaks. Availability: Saint-John’s-wort is a widely distributed weed in the western U.S. Seeds are available from specialty seed catalogs. The dried herb and its var- ious preparations are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Saint- John’s-wort is easy to transplant or start from seed, but before you plant it, be aware that it is listed as a harmful weed in many areas of the country. If you introduce this plant into your herb gar- den, be careful that it doesn’t escape cul- tivation. Harvest when the plants are in full bloom, usually in early to mid-July. Clip off the flowering tops, and plan on making tincture or an oil infusion as quickly after harvest as possible—this plant is most effective if made into med- icine while it is fresh. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For anxi- ety and depressive disorders, lemon balm, skullcap, valerian, and passion- flower serve as adjuncts or alternatives. For injuries, Saint-John’s-wort combines well with comfrey, calendula, aloe, cayenne, yarrow, or arnica. Licorice, devil’s claw, or yucca root all serve as anti-inflammatory adjuncts. Consider oatstraw, skullcap, cayenne, and valer- ian as possible alternatives or adjuncts for nerve-related problems. As an antivi- ral or antiseptic, Saint-John’s-wort com- bines with echinacea, Oregon grape, certified organic goldenseal, bee balm, thyme, or sage. Cautions and Comments: Recent sci- entific studies have taught us that this herb may strengthen the effects of gen- eral anesthesia. Therefore, Saint-John’s- wort should not be used within 48 hours preceding surgery. While other adverse side effects are rare, some animals can develop a photosensitive rash from its use. Specifically, people or animals with light skin pigments may be susceptible to sunburnlike effects if they consume too much Saint-John’s-wort and subse- quently spend too much time in bright sunlight. This side effect has been observed in livestock who have foraged on large quantities of the plants and is one of the main reasons Saint-John’s- wort is the subject of herbicidal interven- tion in some areas of the West. Common sense should preside here—use extra caution if your animal has white hair, white or pink skin pigment, or a short coat. If a rash does develop, get the ani- mal out of direct sunlight and discontin- ue use of Saint-John’s-wort. Consider finding an alternative therapy—it may be that your animal is not a proper candi- date for Saint-John’s-wort. As always, it is a good idea to consult a holistic veteri- narian before diagnosing your pet’s con- dition and self-prescribing any course of therapy. SHEPHERD’S PURSE Capsella bursa-pastoris Mustard Family Appearance: Shepherd’s purse is a common lawn and vacant lot weed that begins its life as a ground-hugging rosette of 1- to 2-inch leaves that are hairy underneath and smooth on top. Later, the upper plant develops one or more slender, erect stems that can grow to about 20 inches tall. The lance-shaped leaves of the upper plant grow alternate- ly, clasping the stem at their bases. Small, white, inconspicuous flowers are presented at the top of the plant. The flowers develop into seed-bearing cap- sules that look like tiny (1⁄2 inch or small- er), pointed heart-shaped purses—a characteristic that likely earned the plant its common name. These little purses are two-celled, have a single ridge along one side, and are slightly concave along the other. Each cell contains tiny seeds. Many herbalists take the purse char- acteristics of shepherd’s purse for grant- ed and don’t look closely enough when identifying the plant before harvesting. Subsequently, many of them end up gathering and using the wrong plant. Although the impostor is usually another harmless member of the mustard family (Cruciferae), it is often medicinally use- less. The seed capsules of the look-alikes have two cells, but each cell contains only two seeds, whereas shepherd’s purse always has several seeds. Habitat and Range: Shepherd’s purse is a European import that is widely dis- tributed across North America. It is com- mon in cultivated fields, gardens, lawns, vacant lots, livestock grazing areas, and other disturbed areas. It can be found in almost any environment, from cracks in city streets to remote mountain camp- sites. It is adaptable to any elevation from below sea level to timberline. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that continuously reseeds itself Parts Used: Entire plant, including roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic, astringent, stops bleeding, tonic Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract, joints Preparation: Tea, tincture, fresh or dried herb Common Uses: Shepherd’s purse is especially useful in cases of minor uri- nary system bleeding. The diuretic activity of this plant is strong enough to increase urinary volume and thus lower the concentration of acidic strong, dark urine, while its mild astringency helps Herbs for Pets 180 s Materia Medica 181 s to reduce inflammation in the bladder, urethra, and kidneys. Although it is a relatively weak diuretic, its low volatile oil content makes it a gentle alternative to oil-rich herbs such as parsley root, which are contraindicated in preexist- ing cases of kidney disease. Shepherd’s purse is indicated for arthritic condi- tions that are believed to be com- pounded by retention of excess sys- temic waste materials, where it is believed to help with the removal of fluid and various acid compounds from the joints. Studies have shown that the hemo- static activity of shepherd’s purse in the uterus and urinary tract is attributable to more than just simple tissue-shrink- ing astringency. The plant contains an assortment of amine and flavonoid con- stituents that are believed to actually strengthen capillaries and reduce their permeability. This makes shepherd’s purse an excellent urinary tonic for ani- mals who exhibit occasional blood in the urine as a result of structural anom- alies, scar tissue, or nonspecific atony of the bladder. It has also been found to enhance uterine tone, contract the uterine walls, and lower blood pressure, making it useful in postpartum bleeding and difficult placenta delivery. Externally, a poultice of the fresh plant can be applied to wounds to stop bleeding. A tincture, poultice, or water or oil infusion can be applied to the skin, as a weak alternative to mustard, to increase subcutaneous capillary cir- culation at the site of closed-tissue injuries and to help improve the strength and structure of capillaries. Availability: A widespread weed; avail- able through specialty seed catalogs Propagation and Harvest: Rather than buy dried shepherd’s purse at an herb store, it’s best to harvest your own fresh herb. The herb loses much of its medicinal potency when it dries and should be used or made into tincture as soon as it is harvested. This plant is easy to grow and spreads all over the garden if allowed. It grows in most soils but grows best in heavily manured soil, which is why it is so common in pas- tures. Harvest by pulling up the entire plant after the seed capsules have devel- oped but before the plant dries. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Shepherd’s purse can be combined with yarrow in fresh herb tea for bleeding fibroids or as an external first aid remedy (use the two herbs in a poultice). For arthritis, shep- herd’s purse combines with yucca root, boswellia, devil’s claw, licorice, or alfalfa. Dandelion leaf serves as a stronger, yet equally safe, diuretic. For urinary Capsella bursa-pastoris bleeding that is secondary to infection, combine with marshmallow, echinacea, and Oregon grape. Cautions and Comments: The authors have never witnessed any side effects from the use of this herb, but it has been theo- rized by others that Shepherd’s purse can cause contractions of the uterus and should not be administered to pregnant animals—reserve it for the postpartum period. It is also thought to have hemo- static properties that may interfere with blood-thinning drugs. Therefore, caution and common sense dictates that this herb is best avoided in animals with clot- ting disorders. SKULLCAP Scutellaria lateriflora Mint Family Appearance: Skullcap is differentiated from other mints by its blue or white flowers, which are borne (in most species) at the top third of the plant in symmetrically arranged sets of two or more. The flowers are two lobed and tubular; one lobe forms an upper lip, and one forms a larger apronlike lower lip. The lance-shaped, finely to coarsely toothed leaves oppose one another, as in all mints. Like most mints, skullcap has distinctly four-sided stems. Habitat and Range: Several native species of skullcap grow in North America, most of which live in moist meadows, seeps from springs, and ripar- ian thickets. Scutellaria lateriflora and several other cultivars are grown throughout the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or perennial (depending on species and climate) that blooms from June to August Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Mod- erates nerve transmissions, sedative, antispasmodic, anticonvulsant Strongest Affinities: Nervous system Preparation: Tea, tincture, dried or fresh herb Common Uses: For centuries, herbalists have recognized skullcap as one of the most effective herbal nervines available. It is commonly used for acute or chronic cases of nervous tension or anxiety and to help relieve pain from nerve-related injury or disease. Historically, it has been used to treat convulsions, epilepsy, mul- tiple sclerosis, hysteria, and delirium tremens, which is shaking and delirium associated with withdrawals from alco- hol (also called d.t.’s). Scutellaria lateriflo- ra is still known by many people as “mad dog weed” from its use in the eighteenth century as a cure for rabies. Yet despite its rich history and current popularity among herbalists, very little scientific study has been focused on this plant. From the studies that have been con- ducted, we have learned that the chem- istry of skullcap varies considerably between species, although all species that are marketed and used as herbal medicine contain scutellarin, a flavonoid compound that has been shown to possess sedative and antispasmodic qualities. We find skullcap especially effective for general nervousness and excitability in dogs and cats and for any condition characterized by oversensitivity of the peripheral nerves. It helps relieve nerv- ous tension related to pain or a traumat- ic experience, and it is useful as an anti- spasmodic in nervous irritations of the cerebrospinal system such as sciatica or posttraumatic neuralgia. Herbs for Pets 182 s Materia Medica 183 s Unlike valerian and other herbal seda- tives, skullcap by itself does not bring about drowsiness, nor does it dull the reflexes or interfere with motor coordi- nation. Instead, skullcap acts to moder- ate an animal’s responsiveness to physi- cal or nonphysical stimuli and helps to alleviate general restlessness and nervous twitching. This makes it suitable for high- strung felines who are recovering from a frightful experience but who need all of their survival mechanisms intact during their daily outdoor adventures. Herbalists consider skullcap a specific remedy for grand mal epileptic seizures. We have received several encouraging reports from people who are using skull- cap to reduce the severity and frequency of seizures in their epileptic dogs, espe- cially when the herb is combined in equal parts with valerian. Science has not yet revealed exactly how skullcap works in this capacity, but herbalists theorize that it may calm nerve impulses throughout the body, while inhibiting activity in higher brain centers where epileptic seizures might be triggered. Skullcap’s effectiveness in moderating epileptic episodes may explain its tradi- tional reputation as a cure for rabies: back in the eighteenth century, little was known about epilepsy, and it’s likely that many epilepsy sufferers were misdiag- nosed as having rabies. For epileptic dogs, 0.5 to 1 milliliter of a low-alcohol tincture can be fed two or three times daily, but see your holistic veterinarian for a thorough workup of your companion before proceeding. For generalized nervousness or to help relieve pain in dogs and cats, 0.5 milli- liter per 20 pounds of the animal’s weight can be fed as needed, up to three times daily for up to a week. It’s impor- tant to remember, though, that skullcap and other herbal sedatives can only relieve the symptoms of such disorders; they cannot address the underlying causes. For nervousness in a horse, mule, or goat, 1⁄2–1 ounce of the dried herb can be added to the animal’s feed once per day, as needed. A study in 1957 showed that skullcap can prevent a rise in serum cholesterol in animals on a high-cholesterol diet, which means that the herb might be useful as a dietary adjunct in animals, such as minia- ture schnauzers and beagles, who are predisposed to hyperlipidemia. Availability: Skullcap can be purchased through herb retailers in dried herb form or tinctures. The plants are available through nurseries that specialize in herbs. Propagation and Harvest: Easy to grow from transplants, skullcap likes consistently moist, rich soil and does Scutellaria lateriflora best when allowed a few hours of shade each day. Harvest the plants by clipping the upper third of the flowering plant. The plant can be hung in small bunches and dried for later use (the herb keeps for about a year), or the fresh herb can be made into tincture (the optimum choice). Alternatives and Adjuncts: For epi- leptic dogs or for use as a nerve-calming sedative, skullcap can be combined with an equal part of valerian. Oatstraw and gotu kola also serve as good adjuncts. For nerve pain and spinal injuries, com- bine skullcap with an equal amount of Saint-John’s-wort. Cautions and Comments: Some texts and many toxicology databases still claim that skullcap, when used in large quantities, can be damaging to the liver. However, in the years following the first writing of this book, we have learned that such claims are inaccurate. The reports of hepatotoxicity that fueled ear- lier controversies over the safety of this herb involved skullcap that had been adulterated with germander; an inex- pensive look alike that really can be dam- aging to the liver. Fortunately, the stan- dards by which skullcap is cultivated, processed, and analytically identified are better than ever, and safe, good quality skullcap is in ample supply. Just buy it from a reputable source. This is a very safe herb. SLIPPERY ELM Ulmus fulva Elm Family Appearance: Slippery elm is a decidu- ous tree that can grow to 80 feet tall. The outer bark is thick, furrowed, and pinkish brown. The broadly lance- shaped alternate leaves are 4–8 inches long and have toothed margins. The upper surfaces of the leaves feel like sticky sandpaper. Habitat and Range: Deciduous forests of the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada; slippery elm is at risk of endan- germent in many areas. Cycle and Bloom Season: The tree flow- ers from March to June and loses its leaves in the fall. Parts Used: Inner bark Primary Medicinal Activities: Lubri- cates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; emollient, astringent, anti-inflammatory, nutritive Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, respiratory tract, skin Preparation: Tea, tincture, dried and powdered inner bark Common Uses: Slippery elm is best used in the digestive tract, where it serves as a soothing, protecting, and lubricating demulcent and a general astringent at the same time. These effects make slippery elm applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. For diar- rhea, enteritis, colitis, and irritations of the stomach, the tannin constituents of slippery elm tighten digestive mucosa to reduce inflammation and inhibit the entrance of excess fluids into the intes- tines. At the same time, the slippery, oily mucilage constituents of the herb help lubricate the digestive tract to assist in the elimination of waste. In cases of con- stipation, slippery elm soothes, protects, and lubricates mucous membranes, assisting and relaxing smooth muscles that have been working extra hard to eliminate waste. Higher up in the Herbs for Pets 184 s Materia Medica 185 s digestive tract, the mucilaginous astrin- gency of the herb lubricates and helps reduce inflammation in the throat, mak- ing swallowing easier and soothing a painful cough. It plays the same roles in the upper respiratory passages, where it relieves the discomforts of kennel cough and other types of bronchitis. Slippery elm is also nutritious; it was used as a food staple during times of economic hardship in Appalachia. It con- tains vitamins A, B complex, C, and K and high amounts of calcium, magne- sium, and sodium. The fresh inner bark has a slightly sweet pecanlike flavor and was often given to children as a treat to chew on (like chewing gum). It can be fed to convalescing animals as a nutri- tional digestive tonic—1 teaspoon of the dried inner bark steeped in 8 ounces of hot water to which 1 teaspoon of honey has been added. If constipation is a problem, 1 teaspoon of organic yogurt (a brand that has live cultures) can be added to the mixture. The entire mix- ture, inner bark and all, is then fed to the animals. Many animals will eat this for- mula in the absence of anything else, and it is useful for a wide variety of diges- tive or respiratory problems in dogs and cats. If your companion cannot tolerate honey because of diabetes, allergies, or other problems, eliminate honey from the recipe. If your companion won’t eat the bark, strain the fluid through a fine sieve and pour it onto her food. A glyc- erin-based tincture is also effective and offers the convenience of administering a squirt or two into the mouth. A good starting dose for the tincture is 1⁄4–1⁄2 tea- spoon (1–2 milliliters) for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, once or twice daily. On the skin, a poultice of slippery elm bark can be applied to wounds, ulcers, boils, or abscesses. In essence, it is used the same way as plantain (Plantago sp.), a common weed that is better suited for this purpose because of its abundance and resilience to human impact. Availability: Available at herb retailers. When you buy slippery elm bark, make sure that you’re getting the inner bark only. The powder or bark should be light, fluffy, and pale pinkish tan in color. If it has darker flecks in it or appears corky, stringy, or woody, it was probably carelessly harvested and the inner bark was not separated from the outer bark. Inclusion of the outer bark dramatically changes the nature of the medicine. The outer bark contains a greater amount of tannin constituents, which may cause digestive or urinary tract irritation. Propagation and Harvest: Slippery elm is available through nurseries that specialize in native plants. This tree is not Ulmus fulva difficult to grow, but, like most trees, it grows slowly. If you have room for one of these beautiful shade trees, by all means plant one! You will be doing a dwindling species a great favor. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Slippery elm has remained quite popular among herb users for centuries. Unfortunately, many of its consumers remain unaware of its declining population in the wild. Slippery elm is being overharvested, and many of the trees are succumbing to Dutch elm disease—a fungal infection that kills trees. Adding to these problems are careless methods by which much of the bark is harvested: the entire tree, which may be one hundred years old, is cut down, stripped of its bark, then used as firewood or hardwood lumber with lit- tle regard to sustenance of the species. All in all, consumer demand is currently outstripping natural supply. We include slippery elm here so that you know to use this herb conservative- ly, respectfully, and in a proper therapeu- tic context. Slippery elm should be reserved for circumstances where alter- natives are ineffective, and every effort should be made to support the tree’s cul- tivation and conservation in the wild. Fortunately, some effective and accessi- ble alternatives exist for slippery elm. In many instances, slippery elm can be sub- stituted with the common weed plantain (Plantago sp.). If a more mucilaginous remedy is needed, marshmallow root (Althea officinalis) is an excellent alterna- tive, especially when it is combined with an astringent such as goldenrod or rasp- berry leaf, or a tincture or decoction of uva ursi or juniper. Cautions and Comments: With the rare exception of possible allergic reac- tions, slippery elm is generally safe for animals. The outer bark, however, (which shouldn’t be in the slippery elm you buy) can cause irritation to the digestive and urinary tracts and may induce abortion in pregnant animals. THYME Thymus vulgaris Mint Family Appearance: Most species of thyme are ground-hugging plants with strong sprawling stems, small (1⁄8 inch) opposite leaves, and tiny cylindrical flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. There are countless variations of leaf color, fragrance, and even flavor avail- able to the gardener. In fact there are so many variations of Thymus spp., it is pos- sible to dedicate an entire garden to them. Habitat and Range: Thyme originated in the Mediterranean region. Over 350 species of Thymus exist worldwide most of which are cultivated as a seasoning herb or landscape shrub. Cycle and Bloom Season: Most of the species of thyme are evergreen perenni- als. Blooming occurs from early spring to midsummer. Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, expels intestinal gas, antispas- modic, cough suppressant, expectorant, astringent, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Digestive and respiratory tracts Preparation: Tea or tincture Common Uses: Most of thyme’s medic- inal activity is attributable to its volatile oil constituents, which are thymol and Herbs for Pets 186 t carvacrol. Thymol is a good antiseptic for the mouth and throat and is useful for fighting gingivitis in dogs and cats. In fact, it is used as the active ingredient in many commercial toothpaste and mouthwash formulas. Combined with thyme’s infection- fighting qualities are cough suppressant and expectorant properties, which make the herb effective against raspy, unpro- ductive coughs that are secondary to fungal or bacterial infection. As an anti- spasmodic, thyme helps to ease bronchial spasms related to asthma. A glycerin tincture, or an alcohol tincture that has been sweetened with honey, serves well for most internal applica- tions—1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) for each 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight (12–20 drops for cats), fed to the animal as needed up to twice daily. A cooled tea works too, provided it has been brewed with near-boiling water to draw out the volatile oil constituents—1 teaspoon per 30 pounds of body weight for dogs, 1⁄4 teaspoon for cats, fed directly into the mouth two to three times daily. For infections of the mouth or as a preventa- tive against gingivitis, the tincture or a strong tea can be directly applied to the gum lines or infected sites with a swab. In the digestive tract, it is a useful carmi- native and antispasmodic in cases of dys- pepsia, irritable bowel, and colitis. It also helps expel parasites, especially hook- worms. In these cases, the dried or fresh herb can be fed with your companion’s food—1 teaspoon per pound of food fed to dogs, a sprinkling for cats. Horses and other large herbivores with digestive problems can be fed a 1⁄2 cup of the dried herb or a handful of the fresh plants daily. Rabbits, birds, and other small ani- mals can be fed a couple of fresh sprigs daily. On the surface of the body, thyme tea (skin rinse) or an oil infusion is appro- priate for various fungal or bacterial infections of the skin. In the urinary tract, the tea or tincture serves as an antimicro- bial as well as a mildly astringent tonic that is said to treat urinary incontinence. Use the tincture doses we have suggest- ed for respiratory problems. Availability: Thyme can be purchased at any food market. The plants are avail- able at nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Thyme is easy to grow from seeds or transplants. It prefers light soil with neutral acidity but can be grown just about anywhere. It is an excellent choice for rock gardens and walkway borders. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For infec- tions of the mouth, thyme combines with myrrh, Oregon grape, certified organic goldenseal, bee balm, or sage. Materia Medica 187 t Thymus vulgaris For respiratory infections, combine with garlic, echinacea, bee balm, or sage. For asthma, thyme works best when used in conjunction with elecampane, mullein leaf, nettle, or lobelia. For digestive prob- lems, fennel, parsley seeds, chamomile, and peppermint are all good herbs to combine with thyme. For worms, try combining thyme with equal amounts of garlic and raw pumpkin seeds. Cautions and Comments: Thyme is safe, but when it’s ingested in large amounts, it has been known to affect menstrual cycles. Therefore, it should be used with moderation in pregnant animals. When isolated from the rest of the plant, thymol is toxic. Do not use an essential oil of thyme in or on your animal. In horses, the volatile oils of thyme may be detectable in a blood sample, and it may be considered a “prohibited substance” under Jockey Club or other horse show rules. UVA URSI Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Heath Family Appearance: Also known as kinnikin- nick (an American Indian word meaning “smoking mixture”), uva ursi is a mat- forming, densely branched ground cover with woody trailing stems. Several other species of Arctostaphylos are small to medium (up to 10 feet tall) erect hard- wood shrubs. In mountainous areas of the southwestern U.S., A. manzanita is often seen as a predominant shrub. Despite their size differences, all species present leaf, flower, and fruit characteris- tics that distinguish them as members of the Arctostaphylos genus, and all are medicinally useful despite the fact that A. uva-ursi is the species of primary interest among herbalists. The leathery leaves are spoon to lance shaped, with upper sur- faces darker green than their undersides. Flowers are pink and urn shaped, and they are arranged in nodding, few-flow- ered terminal clusters. The fruits are mealy red berries that look like tiny apples. Habitat and Range: Open forest clear- ings from the montane zone up to the timberline. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is the predominant species, ranging through- out the northern third of the U.S., Canada, and Europe. In the mountains of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and especially California (where A. manzanita is pro- tected by law), several of the larger shrub varieties are predominant. Cycle and Bloom Season: Blooms April through June. Fruits begin to develop in midsummer. Parts Used: Leaves and twigs Primary Medicinal Activities: Astrin- gent, antimicrobial, diuretic Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract and skin Preparation: Decoction or tincture Common Uses: Uva ursi contains a con- siderable amount of tannins (up to 40 percent), making it one of nature’s most powerful astringents. It also contains hydroquinones—an assortment of chem- ical compounds that are active against a wide variety of pathogens, including Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylo- coccus aureus, Bacillus subtilus, E. coli, and various Shigella species. Each of these pathogens are often implicated in uri- nary tract infections. It’s important to Herbs for Pets 188 u know, however, that for uva ursi to be an effective treatment for urinary tract infections, an alkaline reaction is neces- sary to release the hydroquinone into an active form. This means that uva ursi cannot contribute antibacterial activities to a urinary system in which urine is acidic, a condition that is common in animals, especially cats, with chronic uri- nary tract problems. In these circum- stances, it is necessary either to elevate urine pH into a healthier alkaline state or to combine uva ursi with other antibac- terial herbs (the easier option). Regardless of urine pH, uva ursi serves as an effective astringent to stop bleeding and reduce urinary tract inflammation. Uva ursi is a strong herb, and its high tannin content can irritate the kidneys if used for more than a few consecutive days. Therefore, it is best reserved for sit- uations in which quick intervention is needed. To use uva ursi internally, make a decoction from the fresh or dried leaves and stems. Use 1 cup of the dried herb for each 3 cups of water. The leathery, almost plasticlike struc- ture of this plant makes it nearly imper- vious to water, so a simple tea is not an option. For dogs, 1 teaspoon of the cooled decoction can be fed once daily for no more than three days. Cats and ferrets require only 1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon. Have the animal drink as much water as pos- sible when using this herb, even if you must resort to using a meat broth. The idea is to course the herb through the urinary tract so it can quickly alleviate infection and reduce inflammation. Then, after a day or two, gentler astrin- gent herbs can be used to finish the therapy safely and effectively. Horses and other large herbivores can be fed 1 cup of the dried leaves daily for up to three days. For contact dermatitis, seb- orrhea, and fleabites, the decoction can be diluted (1 cup decoction to 1 quart of water) and used as an antibacterial and astringent skin rinse. Availability: Uva ursi is available through herb retailers. The plants are available through nurseries that special- ize in native plant landscaping. Propagation and Harvest: Uva ursi is hardy northward to central Canada and serves as an excellent antierosion ground cover. It’s not particular about soil but prefers slightly to moderately acid conditions. Uva ursi and other members of the Arctostaphylos genus are especially good landscape choices in mountain areas of the western United States and Canada. The leaves and trailing stems can be clipped, dried, and used anytime during their evergreen growth. Materia Medica 189 u Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Alternatives and Adjuncts: When treating most forms of urinary tract infection, it’s a good idea to help flush the animal’s system with the use of diuretic herbs. Dandelion leaf, chick- weed, cleavers, or shepherd’s purse serves this purpose well. For animals with overly concentrated acidic urine, uva ursi can be preceded (by an hour or so) by a dose of mullein leaf tea, which is moder- ately effective at alkalinizing the urine. Uva ursi also can be combined with antimicrobials such as Oregon grape, sage, thyme, or echinacea. Marshmallow serves as a soothing and lubricating adjunct in urinary tract therapies and is especially useful in the passage of stones and gravel. Corn silk, couch grass, horse- tail, raspberry leaf, and cleavers all serve as weaker urinary astringents that are suitable for minor to moderately severe urinary ailments. Cautions and Comments: Uva ursi is believed to inhibit oxygen delivery to the uterus and therefore should not be used in pregnant animals. Like all strong astringents, long-term internal use of uva ursi may irritate the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Uva ursi may be contraindi- cated in cases of preexisting kidney inflammation or renal failure. See your veterinarian in these circumstances. VALERIAN Valeriana officinalis Valerian Family Appearance: Many people relate the strongly aromatic roots of valerian to the odor of dirty gym socks. Once you have experienced the odor of this plant, identi- fication becomes as simple as probing a finger into the soil to scratch a root. The foliage of this plant is unique as well—the plant first emerges as a cluster of loosely arranged lance-shaped leaves that usually remain larger than the leaves of the mature upper plant. Upper leaves are divided and become progressively smaller toward the top of the plant. Flowers are borne in branched clusters of small white to pink blossoms at the top of the plant. Roots are stringy, brown, and pungent. Several native species of Valeriana occur throughout North America, with size being the primary difference among species. Most wild valerians remain under a foot in height, while domestic valerian can grow in excess of 5 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Valerian is gener- ally found in soils that retain moisture well into summer. Look for it on north- facing banks or hillsides or in partially shaded soils that are high in organic matter. Several native species occur throughout the western third of the U.S. and Canada. It is less common in the midwestern and eastern portions of North America, but in some areas, espe- cially in New England, V. officinalis has escaped cultivation and is thriving. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from May to July Parts Used: Primarily the fall root. The upper parts of the plant are useful, too, but make weaker medicine. Primary Medicinal Activities: Sedative, antispasmodic, anticonvulsive, expels intes- tinal gas, lowers blood pressure Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, digestive tract Preparation: Tincture, tea, fresh or dried root Common Uses: Valerian is without doubt the most widely recognized herbal sedative. As a sedative, valerian Herbs for Pets 190 v works safely and gently to help calm the nerves and achieve physical relaxation. It does not induce an altered state like one would expect from a prescription sedative or from consumption of alco- hol. Contrary to what many people believe, valerian is not a precursor of the tranquilizer Valium. Valium is the brand name for diazepam, a prescrip- tion drug that shares no chemical rela- tionship with valerian. Herbalists use valerian for insomnia and nervous anxiety and to help the body relax in the presence of physical pain. It is useful in calming animals dur- ing thunderstorms and on trips to the vet or groomer or to help your compan- ion rest after surgery. For epileptic ani- mals, it sometimes helps to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. Animal studies have concluded that valerenic and valerenal acid work simi- larly to the drug phenobarbital, a cen- tral nervous system depressant that is used as an anticonvulsive. And the herb has been shown to inhibit production of an enzyme that breaks down gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid that is responsible for inhibiting and regulating neurotransmissions in the brain. The theory is this: by prevent- ing the breakdown of GABA with valer- ian, the increased neural activity that precedes an epileptic seizure is circum- vented, and the triggering mechanism is disabled. When employed as a sedative, valerian is most effective when small doses are fed several times daily over a period of sever- al days. This is especially true when it is used in anticipation of a high-anxiety event, such as a planned interstate trip or a show. In these circumstances, dogs can be fed 5 drops of the tincture three or four times daily, starting three days prior to the event. Cats need only 1 or 3 drops two or three times daily. In the digestive tract, valerian is a useful antispasmodic for situations in which nervousness is compounded by a spastic colon or an upset stomach. But because of valerian’s soaplike content, large amounts of this herb may cause nausea and vomiting. For digestive and antiepileptic uses, 0.25–0.5 milliliter of the tincture can be fed for each 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight two to three times daily. In horses, valerian helps to reduce anxiety and nervous- ness without inducing drowsiness or affecting physical performance. Add 1⁄2 ounce of the dried and chopped herb or 2 tablespoons of the tincture to the horse’s daily feed. For reasons that remain a mystery, a small percentage of human or animal subjects experience completely opposite effects from valerian—it acts as a stimu- lant rather than a sedative. Materia Medica 191 v Valeriana officinalis Availability: Various forms of valerian preparations are available through herb retailers. Plants are available through nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Valerian can be grown from seeds or transplants. It likes rich, consistently moist soil and full sun or partial shade. It is best to plant valerian early in the spring, when the seedlings and young plants can fully benefit from cool temperatures and precipitation. The roots are dug in late fall of the second year of growth. The fresh roots can be made into tincture or they can be chopped and dried for later use. When properly stored in plastic bags, the dried roots keep for up to three years. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For epilep- tic animals, valerian combines well with skullcap. For anxiety and nervousness, valerian can be combined with skullcap, passionflower, hop, oatstraw, or catnip. These herbs also serve as alternatives for animals who have an opposite response to valerian. Cautions and Comments: Valerian can cause digestive upset if used in large doses, and it should not be used in preg- nant animals. Otherwise, it is a safe herb. WORMWOOD Artemesia absinthum Sunflower Family Appearance: Wormwood is attractive to the eyes and intriguing to the nose. It has silky, finely divided, gray-green leaves and a strong fragrance that is rem- iniscent of both sage and pine. The tiny yellow ball-like flowers of the plant are presented in loose clusters on the upper branches of the plant. The entire plant may grow to the size of a small bush up to 4 feet tall. Habitat and Range: A native of Europe, wormwood is cultivated as a garden plant throughout the Northern Hemisphere and has found its way into wild areas throughout most of North America. It is most commonly found along roadways, in vacant lots, on the edges of cultivated fields, and in other waste areas. Cycle and Bloom Season: A long-lived perennial that blooms from June to August Parts Used: Leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- septic, antifungal, astringent, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Skin and diges- tive tract Preparation: Tea or dried leaves Common Uses: As its common name implies, wormwood is among the most well-known herbal worming agents. Hundreds of years of successful use stand in testament to its ability to expel tape- worms, threadworms, and especially roundworms from the intestinal tracts of dogs, cats, horses, goats, sheep, cattle, and humans. We seldom use it, however. Although wormwood makes life miser- able for intestinal parasites, it can also be hard on the host. This is because worm- wood contains an assortment of strong volatile oils, bitter principles, and tannins. If used excessively, these constituents can be irritating to the liver and kidneys, and in extreme cases may even damage the nervous system. This is not to say that wormwood can’t be used safely, but an extra measure of care and moderation is certainly warranted. The problems with Herbs for Pets 192 W using wormwood are multifaceted: too small a dose is ineffective, but a larger dose might be toxic. Small doses admin- istered over a long period might be effec- tive, but at what cumulative cost to the animal’s kidneys, liver, and nervous sys- tem? Our conclusion is this: wormwood is useful when the absolute necessity of quick parasite intervention outweighs the risk of toxicity. In holistic animal care, this circumstance is a rarity because thera- peutic focus is placed upon the whole ani- mal, not just one or more symptoms of disease. To use wormwood, up to 1⁄4 teaspoon of the dried powdered herb or about 1⁄8 teaspoon (0.5 milliliter) of a low-alcohol tincture can be administered daily at mealtime for each 30 pounds of a dog’s body weight. Cats can receive up to 1⁄8 teaspoon daily. Do not administer worm- wood internally for more than three con- secutive days. Wormwood has an extremely bitter flavor, making it a diffi- cult herb to use. To ease the process of getting it into a hissing cat or tight-lipped dog, the powder or tincture can be placed in a small gel capsule and wrapped with cheese, meat, or other special treat. Externally, wormwood is an effective skin rinse (see chapter 1) for bacterial or fungal infections of the skin, including various forms of dermatophytosis. Availability: Wormwood is available through herb retailers. Plants and seeds are available from nurseries that specialize in herbs. Propagation and Harvest: Wormwood is easy to grow, requiring average soil, full sunlight, and only occasional watering. It is hardy northward to central Canada, and plants often live in excess of ten years. The leaves can be harvested anytime, but they are most potent when gathered on a hot summer afternoon. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For intes- tinal parasites, garlic, pumpkin seeds, black walnut hulls, sage, thyme, and Oregon grape all serve as effective and safer substitutes. For infections of the skin, wormwood combines with calendula, gotu kola, or aloe. Sage serves similar pur- poses as a topical antimicrobial. Cautions and Comments: The volatile oil thujone, which may be present in alco- hol extractions of this plant, can be dam- aging to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system if used excessively. Alcohol prepa- rations of this herb should never be used in animals who suffer from seizures, kidney problems, or liver disease. Wormwood is generally safe when used in dried herb form, or when prepared without alcohol in the form of water infusions (teas) or as a glycerite. However, all forms are best avoided in pregnant or lactating animals. Materia Medica 193 W Artemesia absinthum YARROW Achillea millefolium Sunflower Family Appearance: Yarrow is characterized by its flat-topped terminal clusters of small white to pinkish white flowers and its alternate, finely dissected, featherlike leaves (millefolium translates to “thou- sand-leafed”). The entire plant is strong- ly aromatic, with a pungency much like that of mothballs. Stems are often wool- ly haired. Several cultivars of yarrow have been developed for the floral industry, and many have escaped cultivation. These plants are usually not as cold hardy as their wild cousins and can be identified by their yellow, peach, or red flowers. Habitat and Range: Yarrow is a native of Asia that has made itself at home throughout the northern hemisphere from sea level to above the timberline. The den- sity of plant populations increases as one travels north through the western U.S. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that often remains in bloom throughout the spring and summer Parts Used: Flowers, leaves, and stems Primary Medicinal Activities: Antiseptic, analgesic, dilates blood ves- sels, promotes sweating, expectorant, anti-inflammatory, stops bleeding, tonic, lowers blood pressure, fever reducing (febrifuge), insect repellent, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Circulatory and respiratory systems, urinary and diges- tive tracts, skin Preparation: Dry or fresh herb, tea, tincture, or oil infusion Common Uses: Yarrow is one of the most versatile and well-known herbs in nature’s apothecary. In ancient Europe, yarrow was known as “wound wort” by warriors who used the plant (presumably for their horses as well as themselves) to stop bleeding and disinfect wounds on the battlefield. The genus name, Achillea, is derived from the name of the ancient Greek warrior Achilles. The powder or poultice of the dried or fresh plant is useful for treating less deliberate open wounds such as a barbed wire cut or a foot pad laceration caused by a broken bottle. To effectively stop bleeding and inhibit bacteria, sim- ply crush the herb as finely as possible and apply it directly to the wound. A cooled tea of the plant can be used as a pain- and itch-relieving antiseptic skin rinse, and the aromatic nature of the plant may be of help in repelling fleas, mosquitoes, and biting flies. Yarrow is a unique peripheral vasodilator and vascular tonic. When taken internally, the flavonoid con- stituents of yarrow act to dilate and strengthen peripheral blood vessels and help clear away small blood clots, thus increasing circulation to the skin and extremities. Combined with this are anti- inflammatory qualities, making yarrow helpful for problems such as arthritis, navicular syndrome in horses, and severe cases of dermatitis in which peripheral circulation has been impaired by inflam- mation. It is also useful for subcutaneous blood clots of the ears and the skin, especially when internal doses of the tincture are used simultaneously with external applications of an oil infusion. In the urinary tract, a yarrow tea or tincture serves as a bacteriostatic agent in the treatment of chronic or acute cys- titis. It is useful in the early stage of a kid- ney infection. In the lungs, yarrow’s bac- teriostatic and expectorant properties Herbs for Pets 194 y help the body in its effort to eliminate invading microbes and other foreign bodies. At the same time, the herb dilates and tonifies respiratory blood ves- sels to improve pulmonary efficiency. Because of this remarkable combination of activities, yarrow is among the first herbs we reach for in cases of pneumo- nia. Yarrow also may be beneficial for racehorses who suffer from hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (bleeding from the respiratory tract) as a result of too much strenuous exercise. In the digestive tract, yarrow is mar- ginally effective at expelling worms and is useful for inflammations, bleeding, and bacterial infections of the stomach and colon. The bitter principles stimu- late digestion and appetite. And yarrow is well known among herbalists as a fever-reducing remedy. It is especially effective when taken as a tea at the onset of a fever. Scientists once thought that yarrow’s therapeutic qualities were chiefly attrib- utable to tannins and a volatile oil called azulene. The chemical makeup of yarrow is extremely complex, however, and recent studies have found that the plant contains sterols and various other com- pounds that possess a much wider range of medicinal activities than originally thought. One study suggests that yarrow may be a useful antitumor agent and may play an active role in the treatment of certain types of leukemia. To use yarrow internally in dogs and cats, a tincture is usually preferable over a tea because the herb is bitter and hard to feed in appreciable quantities. For dogs, about 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) of the tincture can be fed for each 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight, two to three times daily. Cats and similar- sized animals need only 1⁄8 teaspoon twice daily. Horses and other large herbi- vores can be allowed to eat the plants from their pastures as they wish, or they can be fed 1 ounce of the dried herb as part of their daily ration. Availability: Yarrow is a widely distrib- uted weed that is also available through herb retailers and nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Yarrow is easy to grow from seed or transplants. True yarrow (A. millefolium) is hardy down to at least -30° F and is drought tolerant as well. The yellow and hybrid varieties (of which there are several col- ors) are less hardy but are still easy to grow in most areas of North America. Moderately rich, slightly acid soil and full sun yields healthy plants, which usually don’t bloom until their second year of growth. Harvest the upper third of the flowering plant (stems, leaves, and flow- ers) in midsummer on a dry, warm day— Materia Medica 195 y Achillea millefolium this is when the highest concentration of active constituents are found in the plant. Alternatives and Adjuncts: To stop bleeding, nothing compares with a first aid powder made from a fifty-fifty mix of dried yarrow and cayenne. For situations requiring a vascular tonic or peripheral vasodilator, yarrow combines well with garlic, cayenne, ginkgo, hawthorn, or ginger. For urinary tract infections, marsh- mallow, couch grass, horsetail, echi- nacea, and Oregon grape combine well with yarrow. For infections of the diges- tive tract, combine yarrow with Oregon grape. For topical treatment of inflam- mations and infections of the skin, con- sider sage, rosemary, calendula, chamomile, and juniper as adjuncts or alternatives. For topical treatment of closed injuries, yarrow combines espe- cially well with arnica. Cautions and Comments: Allergic reactions to yarrow are fairly common, and the volatile oils of the plant may cause dermatitis when they are applied to the skin of sensitive animals. This plant contains thujone, a substance that is poorly water soluble but may be present in alcohol extractions of the herb. Any herb preparation that contains apprecia- ble amounts of thujone has a potential of being toxic, especially if large quantities are consumed over an extended period of time (meaning that moderation is the key to safe long-term use). Like most herbs that are rich with volatile oils, yarrow should be used with caution in pregnant or lactating animals, as these constituents have been shown to cross the placenta to the fetus and are known to have stimulant effects upon the uterus if they are ingested in sufficiently large quantities. YELLOW DOCK Rumex crispus Buckwheat Family Appearance: Yellow dock is a hearty perennial that may grow up to 5 feet. The elongated lance-shaped leaves at the base of the plant grow up to 12 inch- es long and 4 inches wide. The leaves are often curled at their margins (hence another common name for the plant: curly dock). The alternate stem leaves are smaller but more numerous. The sin- gle stout stem is often red and bears long clusters of small, greenish white flowers above the rest of the plant. As the flowers mature and dry, they turn a rust-red color that often stands in bold contrast to the surrounding flora. Habitat and Range: Widely distrib- uted in disturbed areas throughout North America. The entire Rumex genus is imported from Europe. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms May through August Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Stim- ulates bile production, helps with blood cleansing, laxative, antimicro- bial, nutritive Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, skin, and liver Preparation: Tincture, tea, and dried root Common Uses: Yellow dock is well described as a quick-cleansing herb. The root contains a combination of anthraquinone, small amounts of oxalic acid and oxalates, and other con- stituents that stimulate liver function Herbs for Pets 196 y and contractions of intestinal smooth muscles (peristalsis). In effect, the body is prompted to work harder at eliminat- ing waste from the bloodstream and digestive tract. This makes yellow dock especially useful for treating chronic or acute dermatitis that may be attribut- able to toxic excesses and elimination deficiencies in the body. It is also bene- ficial in treating rheumatoid arthritis that is secondary to similar circum- stances. Because of its ability to quickly flush the body of systemic waste, yellow dock is sometimes used in the herbal treatment of cancer. Because the root is extremely high in iron, it is considered a traditional remedy for anemia. Yellow dock is effective when used within the parameters we have just described. It is somewhat of a “heroic remedy,” an herb that forces quick, dra- matic responses in the body, much like an allopathic drug. Therefore, its use in the holistic care of animals should be limited to short-term applications at the onset of detoxification therapies that are focused on long-term holistic results. Alternatively, it can be used as a potentiating adjunct in combination with tonic herbs such as burdock, dan- delion, red clover, slippery elm, and alfalfa. Using yellow dock as a sympto- matic quick fix (such as for constipa- tion) amounts to little more than substi- tuting an herb for a drug. Externally, yellow dock can be used as an itch-relieving, alterative skin rinse or poultice in the treatment of skin dis- orders such as seborrhea, pyoderma, and contact dermatitis. To use yellow dock internally, consult your holistic veterinarian. Availability: A widely distributed weed. Available through herb retailers and seed catalogs that specialize in medicinal plants. Propagation and Harvest: Yellow dock is easy to grow once it’s estab- lished, but the seeds can remain dor- mant in the soil for several years before germinating. However, the plants grow in just about any soil and need little care. The roots are dug in fall after the plant has gone to seed and the leaves have begun to die back for winter. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For situ- ations that require stimulation of the liver, consider dandelion root and Oregon grape as less “heroic” alterna- tives. For anemia, yellow dock com- bines well, in proportionately small amounts, with alfalfa, garlic, red clover, spirulina, and nettle. Cautions and Comments: Even though yellow dock is a much gentler laxative than most herbs that contain Materia Medica 197 y Rumex crispus considerable amounts of anthra- quinones, yellow dock should not be used in situations involving either intes- tinal bleeding or preexisting obstruc- tions such as intestinal tumors. When it is used in moderation, yellow dock is quite safe, but excessive use of the herb is likely to result in intestinal cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting, and it may lead to laxative dependency. Like all stimu- lant laxatives, yellow dock should not be used during pregnancy. YUCCA Yucca schidigera Lily Family Appearance: Although argument exists among botanists over yucca’s specific family classification, yucca is not a cactus. Essentially, “old scholars” consider yucca a member of Agavaceae, the agave fami- ly, while current botanists refer to yucca as a member of Liliaceae, the Lily family. We opt for the latter. Once you see yucca’s beautiful cream-colored flower clusters, you will likely agree that it’s a lily. The showy 1- to 3-inch flowers are presented in dense clusters atop a proportionately tall central stalk. The rest of the plant is characterized by its sharply pointed, swordlike leaves. The various species differ primarily by their size, but the most distinguishable of them is Y. brevifolia, commonly called Joshua tree, which grows up to 20 feet tall. This large yucca is an inhabitant of the high southwestern deserts of Arizona, Nevada, western New Mexico, and especially California, where it is pro- tected by law. Most yucca species, how- ever, share similar appearances with Y. schidigera (Mojave yucca), a long-leafed variety that grows as a 1- to 6-foot-high clump of pain-inflicting puncturing green swords. Habitat and Range: Yucca schidig- era’s natural habitats are the dry coastal canyons of California and the inland deserts of the western U.S. This is the primary variety of commerce, and it is widely harvested and market- ed by the natural products and land- scape industries. Several other species of yucca range throughout the deserts and plains of North America. Although most of us associate plants such as yucca with hot, dry desert environments, the true defini- tion of desert pertains only to rainfall lim- itations, and various species of yucca have adapted to dramatically contrasting temperatures. For example, Y. glauca (small soapweed) thrives in many areas of the northern plains states and Canada, where summers are excruciatingly hot and dry, but winters are subarctic in average temperature. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial, yucca’s bloom frequency and duration depend largely on available precipita- tion. Cultivated plants may bloom once every one to three years, while wild plants may remain dormant for decades. Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutritive, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, musculoskeletal system Preparation: Chopped and dried herb or tincture Common Uses: Yucca contains notable quantities of vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, niacin, phosphorus, protein, and B vita- mins, but its greater healing powers are chiefly attributable to its impressive con- Herbs for Pets 198 y Materia Medica 199 tent of saponin compounds. Saponins are a group of soaplike plant glycosides that are characterized by their tendency to dramatically foam up when agitated with water. While dozens of saponins are present in hundreds of useful plants, two root-borne saponins stand out among others as yucca’s primary active con- stituents: sarsasapogenin and smila- genin. These two compounds are irritat- ing, cleansing, and penetrating to the mucous membranes of the small intes- tine. It is theorized that these actions aid in the assimilation of important minerals and vitamins by allowing increased pas- sage of critical nutrients through the intestinal walls. This in turn optimizes the nutritional value of an animal’s food. Although many of the specifics of yucca’s medicinal actions remain unclear to scientists, the results of feeding yucca can be astounding. In studies conducted at Colorado State University, cattle who received a small quantity of yucca in their feed showed greater weight gain than those who didn’t. Other trial accounts have concluded that chickens who are fed yucca have a tendency to lay more eggs, and dairy cattle tend to pro- duce more milk. Another reason you may find yucca in dog, cat, horse, or cattle feed is because it has been found to reduce the emission of unpleasant odors in urine and feces. In studies that examined the chemical breakdown of urea (the body’s final by- product of digested proteins), it was found that the anhydrous ammonia that is largely responsible for the less-than- delightful odor of animal excrement is caused by a single microbial enzyme called urease. Further studies concluded that food supplements of Y. schidigera inhibit the production of urease, and as a result, fecal and urine odors are reduced by up to 56 percent in dogs and 49 per- cent in cats. Believe it or not, this attrib- ute has brought about tremendous mar- ket appeal for yucca, as millions of peo- ple find the notion of less offensive ani- mal waste an attractive alternative to promptly cleaning it up. The holistic question is, What are the deeper purpos- es of the urease enzymes we wish to sup- press? Urease is a natural by-product of a natural metabolic process, and we can only speculate about the long-term results of our interference. People who accept this concept without question simply don’t realize (or don’t care) that poor-quality proteins produce excess urea and larger, more offensive stools. If an animal is fed a balanced natural diet, excess fecal and urine odor shouldn’t occur. Although much of yucca’s nutritive value is likely attributable to its actions upon the intestinal membranes, the mystique surrounding this plant’s impressive track record as a medicine Y Yucca schidigera becomes much clearer when we take a close look at its active ingredients. Sarsasapogenin and smilagenin are known by the scientific and herbal com- munity as phytosterols, or more specifi- cally steroidal saponins, which are com- pounds that act as precursors to the cor- ticosteroids naturally produced in the body. Both of these compounds are extracted from yucca and various other herbs as starter substances in the pro- duction of pharmaceutical corticosteroid drugs. If this sounds ominous to those of you who are seeking natural alternatives to such drugs, please rest assured. The differences between a phytos- terol and a synthetic steroid drug are extreme. The process by which phytos- terols are used to manufacture pharma- ceutical steroids starts with a simple plant compound and proceeds from there into a complex scientific process that would have given Einstein a headache. Comparing yucca to a corti- costeroid drug is like comparing a single chemical compound in a packet of active dry yeast with a loaf of finished twelve- grain bread. The terms plant steroids and plant hormones are erroneous—no known plant actually carries steroidal hormones into the body. In essence, phytosterols stimulate and assist the body in using and producing its own corticosteroids and corticosteroid-related hormones. Furthermore, steroidal sa- ponins work with the natural immune functions of the body, whereas syntheti- cally produced counterparts such as the prescription drug prednisolone are designed and introduced into the body with the intent of suppressing immune functions to attain the desired results. Although this theory has not been proven as fact by the scientific communi- ty, it can be reasonably hypothesized that the natural corticosteroid-like actions of yucca may play a role in the body’s natural production of growth hormones. This in turn may contribute significantly to the accelerated growth and production we see in animals who receive this plant in their food. We do know, however, that yucca is safe when fed in moderation. A water extract (tea) of Y. glauca (small soapweed) has been shown to have antitumor activity against certain melanomas in mice. Its mechanism in this context is believed to stem from polysaccharide constituents, not neces- sarily steroidal saponins. In a study conducted at the begin- ning of the twentieth century, the “saponin extract” from the “desert yucca plant” was found to bring about safe and effective relief from pain and inflamma- tion in human arthritis patients who were given the extract four times daily over an extended period. Although this study has been repeatedly discredited by the American Arthritis Foundation because of the controversial manner in which it was conducted, the beneficial effects of yucca in humans and animals remain clearly validated in the minds of holistic practitioners who have used it repeatedly and have witnessed positive results. Several contemporary natur- opaths, veterinarians, and animal nutri- tionists who use yucca in their practices claim that yucca has a 50 to 80 percent success rate in bringing relief to patients suffering from either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Again, yucca’s effectiveness here is likely attributable to the plant’s nutrition-assisting and anti- inflammatory actions of its steroidal saponin constituents. To stimulate appetite and increase absorption of nutrients or to relieve the pain and inflammation of arthritis, add a 1⁄2 teaspoon of the dried and powdered root to each pound of a dog’s daily food ration. Cats need only 1⁄4 teaspoon daily. Herbs for Pets 200 y Materia Medica 201 If you opt to use a tincture, find or make one that contains less than 5 percent alcohol because high-alcohol prepara- tions of this herb may nauseate animals. A good tincture dose is about 1⁄8 tea- spoon (0.5 milliliter) for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, once daily before a meal. Half a cup of the dried, chopped root is a sufficient daily dose for horses and other large animals. Availability: Herb retailers and land- scape nurseries Propagation and Harvest: Because of their moderate size, attractive flowers and foliage, and low water and mainte- nance requirements, Y. schidigera and Y. glauca have become popular as land- scape plants in areas with moderate tem- peratures and low to moderate precipita- tion. These plants do well in depleted soils, and once established they require little care. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For arthritis, yucca combines well with al- falfa, licorice, dandelion, or shepherd’s purse. Cautions and Comments: If used in large dosages or over an extended period of time, yucca may become irritating to the stomach lining and intestinal mucosa, which may cause vomiting. This problem can be especially dangerous in horses and other large animals who are unable to vomit (instead they bloat). Many Indian tribes of the American Southwest used yucca preparations to induce vomiting in cases of food poisoning. For this reason we would not use any food additive that contains in excess of 15 percent yucca root unless instructed to do so by a veteri- narian or trained animal nutritionist. We do not recommend feeding yucca every day in an animal’s diet either; rather, give the animal at least a two-day break from the herb each week. Many holistic prac- titioners believe that if the plant is used constantly over an extended period of time, the saponins in yucca actually begin to have a reverse effect, slowing nutrient absorption (especially fat-solu- ble vitamins such as vitamin D) in the small intestine. Allowing breaks in your animal’s diet helps to alleviate the possi- bility of a cumulative irritating effect in her digestive tract. y Ashwaganda Withania somnifera Primary Medicinal Activities: Strengthens the body’s resistance to stress (adaptogenic), anti-inflammatory, antitumor, lowers blood pressure Common Uses: Coughs, debility, nausea, fever, tumors, wounds, senility Safety/Cautions/Contraindications: None found Bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus Primary Medicinal Activities: Antispasmodic Common Uses: Eye problems (given inter- nally) Safety/Cautions/Contraindications: None found Blue Cohosh Caulophyllum thalictroides Primary Medicinal Activities: Uterine tonic, antispasmodic, promotes menstrual discharge, antirheumatic Common Uses: Can be used during preg- nancy in humans anytime there is threat of miscarriage.

Herbs for Pets 210 Materia Medica 211 Supplemental Herb List AILMENTS AND TREATMENTS I n this chapter we discuss some of the more common ailments an animal guardian may encounter in the holistic care of animals. Each ailment is categorized by the body system in which it predominates—for example, kennel cough is discussed in the “Respiratory Problems” section, and the issue of fleas is discussed under “Parasite-Related Problems,” and so forth. For each ailment discussed, we include a variety of herbal treatments and other holistic measures that you may find helpful in reaching a remedial or curative solution for your companion. To learn more about the herb choices we present in this chapter, and to deter- mine whether one or more of these choices may be appropriate for your compan- ion, we recommend that you refer to chapter 3. There you will find detailed infor- mation such as dosages and parts of the herbs used, preparation and administra- tion options, contraindications, and possible side effects of most of the herbs in the repertory. By no means, though, is this repertory a complete representation of all measures of herbal healing. There are hundreds of potentially useful herbs not dis- cussed here, and we urge you to also access the excellent texts included in the bib- liography. This repertory is also not intended to serve as a substitute for the advice and care of a licensed veterinarian. Its purpose only is to express our experiences and opinions. Please keep in mind that we are herbalists, not licensed animal care providers. Anxiety, Nervousness, and Behavioral Problems HOLISTIC APPROACHES It is part of human nature to impose our ideals of acceptable behavior upon our beloved animals. Unfortunately, though, many of us find it difficult to separate An Herbal Repertory for Animals An Herbal Repertory for Animals Chapter 3 Herbs for Pets 214 these ideals from what makes each ani- mal special, unique, and happy. Thousands of animals are euthanized each year because they were “untrain- able” or “uncontrollable,” “barked too much,” or were simply “too much to bear.” Many of these animals were put to death not because there was something untreatably wrong with them but because their identities clashed with their caregivers’. One of the greatest gifts offered to us by animals comes when we learn to look beyond our own needs to their happi- ness. Our eight-year-old shepherd/husky dog, Willow, still barks incessantly, whines obnoxiously on trips to the river, and jumps up onto house guests despite our continuing efforts to direct her toward our needs. Sometimes we want to pull out our own hair and tie her snout shut with it, but instead we have devel- oped patience and respect for her per- sonal nature. Willow is simply doing what she must do to be complete and happy, and while we are still working on the guest-mauling issue, we have learned to accept her just the way she is. By reach- ing this level of acceptance, we have been rewarded with the joy she brings to us as we rejoice with her in her rapturous journey through life. Granted, there is a social stigma attached to certain types of animal behavior. However, before we step in and choose what is best for us, we owe it to our animal companions to try to look at the world through their eyes— perhaps even before we bring one of them home. Anxiety, nervousness, fear, occasional aggression, and depression are normal emotions of each and every animal’s life. Some animals may be terrified of thunder, cars, vets, and stairs. Others may dislike children or other animals. Active dog breeds (such as border collies) usually need wide-open spaces to run, and they become anxious if confined. Many cats who would rather sleep than play become nervous wrecks during car rides. But if your animal’s behavior changes suddenly or if his nervous tendencies worsen over time, your animal may be ill. Contrary to conventional standards, holistic treatment of anxiety, nervousness, or behavioral problems does not begin with the use of sedative or antidepressive medicines but with a critical examination of the caregiver’s perspective of a situa- tion. Are we really treating anxiety or aggression, or is the problem a symptom of something deeper within the animal or his environment? Perhaps the problem is not really the animal’s at all but instead emanates from the caregiver’s unfulfilled expectations. CHRONIC PROBLEMS Emotional, behavioral, and nervous dis- orders can result from nutritional defi- ciencies, endocrine disease, vaccinosis, drug side effects, parasites, neurological disease, or psychological problems. Like humans, animals can suffer from chronic depression that is secondary to chemical imbalances in the brain. But before treat- We owe it to our animal companions to look at the world through their eyes. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 215 ing depression with Prozac (fluoxetine HCl) or Saint-John’s-wort, you should make a thorough assessment of the ani- mal’s diet, health care history, and envi- ronment. In most cases, the caregiver is likely to find that the problem is cor- rectable with dietary changes, some lov- ing attention, and perhaps the correct homeopathic remedy. Our approach toward aggression, depression (which is manifested by a lack of energy, whining, separation anxiety, to name a few symptoms), nervousness, chronic anxiety, or hyperactivity always begins with changing the animal’s diet (usually to raw food) and supplementing it with a complement of vitamins, miner- als, and EFAs. If this does not effect a pos- itive change, the animal should be checked by a veterinarian for underlying physiological disorders such as thyroid or adrenal gland problems, malabsorption, tumors, parasites, or diabetes mellitus. Once the underlying causes are identi- fied, they can be treated with applicable herbs, homeopathic remedies, aroma- therapy, flower essences, or nutritional therapies. Behavioral training, therapeu- tic touch, or a few sessions with a rep- utable animal communicator may also yield good results. In all chronic cases, the sedative herbs (e.g., valerian, skullcap, passionflower) should be limited to temporary control of symptoms during times of added stress such as dreaded car rides to the veterinarian. We do not condone the use of sedative herbs on a daily lifelong basis—not only because of potential side effects but also because they may mask symptoms that are important to recog- nize in reaching curative solutions. Similarly, Saint-John’s-wort and other antidepressants should be reserved for cases in which chronic depression is known to be secondary to brain chemi- cal imbalances. Adaptogenic herbs such as Siberian ginseng, astragalus, and certified-organic ginseng, may be used continually in moderation to boost the body’s function- al abilities under stress. AGGRESSION AND DEPRESSION DISORDERS As of 1999, the use of Prozac had become almost as fashionable for treat- ing aggressive animals as it had for humans with chronic depression disor- ders. Likewise, Saint-John’s-wort had been touted as “the herbal alternative to Prozac,” and it too had become popular for treating aggression and other behav- ioral and emotional disorders in animals. Although Saint-John’s-wort and psy- chotropic drugs may have a place in the treatment of certain disorders, they are not the panaceas that some companies would like us to believe they are. Many experts believe that these substances may actually cause a reverse effect in some animals. In Peter Neville’s ac- claimed book Do Dogs Need Shrinks? he cites case histories in which Prozac not only failed to curb aggression but seem- ingly increased it. One case involved a Determine the cause of any emotional or behavioral disorder before treating it. Herbs for Pets 216 two-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier who was given the drug to stop him from assaulting other dogs. Initially the attacks stopped, but later the dog resumed his hostile behavior—and when he was taken off Prozac, he became more aggressive than ever. Another case involved a three-year-old pointer who was given Prozac to stop her from con- stantly chasing shadows. After three days she began attacking real dogs instead. Compounding the potential prob- lems of reverse or other adverse side effects is our limited ability to identify accurately the causes of aggression and depression disorders in animals. The diagnosis needed to prudently prescribe such drugs is severely limited by lack of verbal communication between animal and healer. In other words, psychotropic drugs (and even the safer Saint-John’s- wort) are usually prescribed as a specula- tive “shot in the dark” approach to sup- pression of symptoms, rather than as part of a curative solution that is based on holism. From a holistic perspective, treatment of aggression begins in the mind of the human guardian—not the animal. The question of what may be missing from the animal’s well-being must be answered before anything else. Is the animal receiving all of the nutrients needed for proper brain function? Was the animal abused or neglected in the past? Is there a genetic predisposition to be addressed? Is there anything in the animal’s living environment that might be contributing to the problem? Has the animal had adequate opportunities to socialize with other animals and people? Is the animal’s behavior related to your own? (This is fairly common—animals often pick up the emotional tone of their living environment.) After the animal’s diet is changed and supplemented, sessions with a good ani- mal behaviorist are highly recommend- ed. Animal behaviorists do not teach “sit-stay” obedience but use their expert knowledge of animal behavior and human-animal relationships to help identify and provide fulfillment of psy- chological requirements. For instance, most dogs who are “fear biters” do not exhibit aggressive behavior out of hate or neurological disease but because they are insecure in the hierarchy of their “pack.” These dogs feel that their human alpha leader is not in charge of their sur- roundings and therefore feel constantly threatened. The animal behaviorists’ job in this situation is to help the guardian and the animal define their positions as leader-protector (the human) and safe- subordinate pack member (the dog). Horses and other herbivores, of course, have completely different psycholo- gies—but they too can find a happier coexistence with their humans with some help from a professional behavior trainer. Once you have begun a curative, long-term approach toward your ani- mal’s aggression or depression, herbs can be used for symptomatic relief dur- Chamomile can help lift your pet’s mood naturally. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 217 ing occasions when stress levels are par- ticularly high. Although many herbalists recommend valerian as a first choice herb for anxiety and aggression, it can have a reverse, sometimes stimulating, effect in some animals. It’s a depressant and tends to compound irritability and depression. Instead of lifting the subject’s spirit, it slows him down and often turns him into a groggy grump. So rather than reaching for valerian, we opt for herbs such as pas- sionflower, lemon balm, chamomile, or catnip that serve more as mood eleva- tors. Rescue Remedy (a flower essence formula) is also one of our first choices. ACUTE NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY Everyone has his or her own sources of psychological stress. Some people get nervous and tense during airplane land- ings. Our dogs get anxious and fright- ened while inside crowded buildings. Stephanie the cat trembles during the first half-hour of long car rides. Herbs can be helpful for gently calm- ing an animal during stressful occasions. In circumstances in which fear and anxi- ety prohibit an otherwise passive animal from relaxing, valerian may induce just enough sedation to allow napping. If the animal’s anxiety is causing him to hiss, spit, bite, or make other demonstrations of potential violence, a dose or two of passionflower, lemon balm, or catnip may help normalize attitude and defuse the situation. If nervousness is causing trembling or hypersensitivity to touch and sound, skullcap or oatstraw can be very effective—especially if combined with valerian or passionflower. A small dose (0.25 milliliters per 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight) of vervain (Verbena officinalis) tincture may reduce muscle twitching and restlessness, but too much of this herb may have a reverse effect. In situations in which nervousness is causing an upset stomach, chamomile, valerian, catnip, or a combination of all three may help induce relaxation and prevent vomiting. Before you reach for valerian or any other herb, try giving your pet a few drops of Rescue Remedy (flower essence formula), which you can purchase at health food stores. You and your com- panion may be pleasantly surprised. Arthritis and Hip Dysplasia The term arthritis is general, referring to the inflammation of a joint. Polyarthritis is the inflammation of several joints. Degenerative arthritis is a term that refers to the condition caused by the wearing of joints as the animal ages. It is also known as degenerative joint disease and is sometimes caused by trauma to the joints, bones, ligaments, or cartilage. Osteoarthritis is usually the result of some type of secondary damage to the joint structures. The damage could result from rupture of ligaments, poor anatomical alignment, or joint dislocation. Inflammatory arthritis can be caused by an infection or an immune-mediated Catnip can help calm an animal who is suffering from anxiety. Herbs for Pets 218 disease that leads to destructive arthritic lesions. In other words, its onset is caused when the immune system actually turns against the body it’s supposed to protect. Arthritis may also take the form of hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia is the abnormal development of the “ball and socket” joint of the hips of dogs. This condition may vary from a slightly abnormal hip joint to the actual dislocation of the joint. There is controversy among holis- tic and homeopathic veterinarians regarding the underlying cause of hip dysplasia. Some holistic veterinarians believe that this condition might be caused by vaccinations, specifically the rabies vaccine. Others say it is caused by heredity—but if this is so, and conscien- tious breeders are taking care not to breed animals who show signs of it, then why is it not being eliminated? Why is it appearing in an increasing number of breeds more frequently? Despite the evi- dence, many veterinarians maintain that hip dysplasia is a genetic predisposition in many breeds of dogs. To an extent this may be true, but we believe that there are too many coincidences between hip dysplasia and overvaccina- tion. If your dog is young and may be prone to hip dysplasia, you might want to consider not vaccinating every year. The belief that hip dysplasia is strictly a hereditary disease discourages many people from growing attached to dogs who are believed to be predisposed. This is truly a shame. Not only can a predis- posed breed of dog lead a normal, healthy life but there is a good possibility that hip dysplasia can be prevented by taking some simple, lifelong measures. In the book Alternative and Comple- mentary Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practice, Wendell O. Belfield, D.V.M., states that hip dysplasia may be caused more by biochemical factors than by genetic inheritance. He believes that hip dysplasia may be an easily controlled bio- chemical condition in most breeds of dogs caused by insufficient collagen syn- thesis. He says that if insufficient amounts of Vitamin C exist in affected dogs, they may have difficulty synthesizing enough collagen to assist in maintaining joint sta- bility. Dr. Belfield substantiates his state- ment with a study he conducted involv- ing eight litters of German shepherd puppies who came from bloodlines that were believed to be afflicted with heredi- tary hip dysplasia. During their pregnan- cy, bitches were administered megadoses of vitamin C, and the puppies were main- tained on a similar regimen until adult- hood. As a result, no signs of canine hip Comfrey can help repair aching bones and joints. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 219 dysplasia were noted in any of the offspring. Unless onset is acute, such as after a joint injury, the first sign of arthritis is usually lameness that may be worsened by cold, inclement weather or exercise. You might first notice that your animal isn’t getting around as easily as he once did. You might observe your companion having difficulty getting on or off the couch, climbing the stairs, or perhaps jumping in and out of the car. If you are keenly perceptive of subtle changes in your companion, early onset of arthritis might be signified by abnormal behavior that points to physical discomfort—per- haps your friend just isn’t his “old self” or appears irritable for no apparent reason. Watch the daily appearance and behavior of your companion closely. Keep a health care diary for your animal, bearing in mind that nothing you observe is insignificant. If you do keep a diary, you will be much more effective in prevent- ing simple morning stiffness from becoming a crippling disease. As an animal ages, his joints don’t move quite as easily as they once did (Don’t we all know that feeling when getting in and out of our favorite easy chair?), but if joint stiffness appears to be progressing ahead of your companion’s age, it’s time to take remedial measures. But before you start administering herbal remedies, you should know the exact nature of your companion’s arthritis. This may require the opinion of a holistic vet- erinarian who can diagnose the many dif- ferent kinds of arthritis. HOLISTIC APPROACHES If your animal has arthritis, his immune system needs either to be boosted or brought back into balance with the rest of his body. But if the arthritis is related to immune system dysfunction, you may find that immunostimulant herbs such as echinacea aggravate your companion’s condition. Remember that the inflamma- tion associated with rheumatoid arthritis is likely caused by an autoimmune attack upon the joints. If we stimulate the immune system into working harder, we might actually make the arthritis worse. Instead, holistic efforts should be directed at what is causing the dysfunc- tion. This starts with a critical assessment of the animal’s diet, an evaluation of pos- sible food allergies, and a thorough investigation of present and historical influences that may be affecting your companion’s immune system. Such influ- ences may include vaccinations, antibiot- ic or steroid drug therapies, or toxic ele- ments in your animal’s environment. Any associated disorders should be identified and corrected as well. For example, does your arthritic companion suffer from chronic constipation, weight problems, hair loss, diarrhea, bladder or kidney problems, chronic infections, or a skin condition? If so, such conditions are likely related to the arthritis. When you have identified as many of these factors as possible, it’s time to take remedial action by piecing this holistic puzzle together. It’s important to remember that because arthritis is such a complex and variable disease, there is no singular herbal approach to treating it. Instead, holistic treatment is multifaceted, including nutritional supplementation and herbs that are tailored to an ani- mal’s individual needs. If the arthritis is due to wear-and-tear joint deterioration (a frequent problem with working or hard-playing animals), then the supplements glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate might assist the body in repairing itself. Glucosamine and its related products, glucosamine sulfate and n-acetylglucosamine, have found a use as nutritional anti-osteoarthritic agents by helping protect and regener- Herbs for Pets 220 ate connective tissue and cartilage in affected joints. N-acetylglucosamine has shown promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, including inflam- matory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, and colitis. Bovine or shark cartilage, vitamin C, and EFA supplements help repair joint tis- sue damage. Horsetail herb might be of help too, as it contains a bioavailable form of silicon, an element that serves as the active matrix in connective tissue development. Comfrey is also considered a classic bone and joint repair herb. In addition to their internal uses, these herbs can be effective when applied in the form of an external compress, especially when combined with cayenne and willow bark, which should not be used in cats. Mineral- and vitamin-rich herbs such as nettle and dandelion provide nutrients that are needed for joint repair along with diuretic activities to help remove excess metabolic wastes from the body, via the urinary tract, that may otherwise contribute to solid buildups in the joints. These herbs also help strengthen kidney function during the ordeal. Another herb to consider is shepherd’s purse—this diuretic is believed to have a special affin- ity toward removal of waste compounds from arthritic joints. Celery seed and parsley root are also excellent choices. Alterative herbs such as alfalfa, red clover, and burdock are strongly indicat- ed to build up blood structure and to assist with the transport of systemic waste from body tissues. Liver supporting herbs (hepatics) such as dandelion root, yellow dock, and Oregon grape help by strengthening liver and gallbladder func- tion, thus helping with digestion, nutri- ent absorption, and solid waste elimina- tion. Lymphatic herbs such as cleavers and calendula may be of assistance by aiding the circulation of tissue-cleansing lymph in and around inflamed areas. Cayenne and ginger also may be use- ful. Both are vasodilators and may bene- fit the arthritic animal by increasing blood circulation to affected areas. In some animals, though, these same actions may aggravate an inflammatory condition. For this reason, internal use of these herbs should proceed with caution, and it is best to administer them in small doses that are proportioned as lesser ingredients to a formula composed of other anti-inflammatory and alterative herbs. Herbs that are useful internally for inflammation and pain of arthritis and hip dysplasia include licorice, yucca, and willow bark (the latter is not for cats). Alfalfa also has a long-standing reputa- tion for relieving the discomforts of arthritis. It should be among one of the first herbs to be considered for internal use because it can be safely fed as a daily food supplement (1 teaspoon per pound of food fed each day). Tonics as well as herbs can be helpful in treating arthritis. Circulatory tonics such as yarrow, hawthorn, rosemary, and ginkgo are worth considering for internal use. They provide a gentle increase of blood flow in tissues surrounding arthrit- ic joints, so muscles remain oxygenated and more flexible. On the facing page is a basic tonic for- mula for arthritic animals. Ingredients can be changed, added to, and propor- tioned to serve the specific needs of your animal. The arthritis relief compress that follows might also help to relieve the pain of arthritis. Animals have a reputation for not let- ting their chronic problems slow them down much. As a result, arthritic joints sometimes become aggravated and inflamed because of physical exertion or injury. Provided that there is no open wound, a simple external application of arnica oil or tincture on the affected An Herbal Repertory for Animals 221 A SYSTEMIC SUPPORT FORMULA FOR CHRONIC ARTHRITIS Combine the following either as dried herbs or tinctures: 2 parts alfalfa 1 part dandelion root 1 part parsley root 1 part cleavers or calendula This formula can be used as a dry herb food supplement. If you do choose to use dry herbs instead of tinctures, use calendula instead of cleavers because cleavers is almost useless after it is dried. An appropriate dose for each 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight is 1 tablespoon mixed into food daily. If you opt to use tinctures, find those that contain little or no alcohol. (They are much easier to feed and much safer on the digestive tract.) You can adminis- ter 2–4 milliliters of the tincture for each 30 pounds of body weight directly into the animal’s mouth or drop it onto his food daily. This combination is safe for dogs, cats, horses, and most other mammals and can be given over an extended period with no ill side effects. If your companion tolerates its bitter flavor, a one-part portion of yarrow can be added to this formula to serve as a vascular tonic. Arthritis Relief Compress* 3 parts dried willow bark 3 parts dried comfrey leaf 3 parts dried yarrow 1 part powdered cayenne *not for use on cats To make this compress, first make a decoction from the willow bark by gently simmering in enough water to cover it for about 20 minutes. Remove from heat but do not drain. While the water is still hot, add the other three ingre- dients. Mix thoroughly, adding just enough boiling water to make a thick paste. Let the mixture stand until it is cool enough to handle but still hot. The poultice is now ready to use as a compress. (See the “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1 for further instructions.) After applying the compress, check it after about 5 minutes to assure that the cayenne is not causing excessive irritation to the animal’s skin. If it is, remove the compress and either lower the proportion of cayenne or remove it from the formula (make a new batch). For best results, the compress should be left on the animal for an hour. Herbs for Pets 222 joints often brings fast symptomatic relief. Some good “strain and sprain” herbal ointments, salves, and liniments are also available on the market, many of which contain time-proven topical anal- gesics such as eucalyptus, cayenne, or camphor. Olbas oil or tiger balm are among our favorites, but do not use these products if your animal is under homeopathic care as they may antidote the homeopathic remedy. Also, be care- ful not to apply any undiluted oil or herbal ointment to an animal, especially cats, who can be sensitive to these types of products. Animals also may lick these products off of their fur and skin, and some of these products may prove toxic if ingested. The discomforts of arthritis can be approached with internal herbal therapies as well, and often the fastest results are reached when topical and internal appli- cations are used simultaneously. See the box on this page for a simple formula for symptomatic relief. Of course, nutrition is the crux of any of the holistic healing modalities and is the most important factor in the preven- tion of arthritis. Many times changing to a raw food diet helps the animal and obviates more drastic measures. Some animals benefit from occasional chiropractic adjustments from a qualified holistic vet who is trained in the proper manipulation of an animal’s spine. Acupuncture may also help many arthrit- ic animals who are in pain. Cancer When we hear the word cancer, many of us immediately think, “Oh no—this is the end!” But cancer is not always a death sen- tence. There are many ways to deal with cancer, and many types of cancer can be treated holistically with the help and advice of a qualified holistic veterinarian. In traditional Western medicine, we have been taught to believe that the best way to treat cancer is to poison it or cut it out. In holistic medicine, the treatment of cancer goes far beyond the physical nature of the disease to address the emo- tional and spiritual aspects of the sufferer as well. Many holistic practitioners believe that by cutting out or poisoning the cancer, we are only driving it else- where—perhaps deeper into the body where it can progress more insidiously. For example, when the “check engine” light goes on in your car, you may stop, check under the hood, and add some oil if needed, or you may park the car and not drive it until the problem is identified. You’re not going to rip out the wire that controls the light so it won’t be a nuisance anymore. Unfortunately, in the case of your car, this quick-fix approach doesn’t address the worn-out crankshaft bearing that degenerates and grinds away the engine block as you continue driving down the road—and when the car breaks down next, the damage is far more likely to be irreparable. Ripping out the wire is A SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF FORMULA Combine the following tinctures: 1 part alfalfa 1 part yucca 1 part licorice for dogs, cats, horses, and most other mammals Feed 1–2 milliliters of this formula for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, one to three times daily for up to ten days or until pain and inflammation are reduced. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 223 exactly what traditional Western medi- cine does in many cases of cancer. Voilà, cut and yank, and the problem has been “remedied.” In holistic medicine, the whole indi- vidual is treated, not just the cancer. Cancer is only a symptom of what is going on deeper within the being. In the treatment or prevention of cancer, all components of body, mind, and spirit need to be evaluated and supported. A critical assessment of diet is the first place to look—feeding poor-quality commer- cial food that is laden with artificial col- ors, preservatives, and by-products only makes the problem worse. The second step is to eliminate unnecessary vaccina- tions from the animal’s life. A body that is working extra hard to build a cancer- fighting immune system doesn’t need the stressful interference of vaccinations. HOLISTIC APPROACHES Nothing would please us more than to inform you of a new herbal “silver bullet” against cancer, but unfortunately such a thing does not exist. Although countless studies support the usefulness of herbs and various other holistic medicines in treating cancer, the disease is far too complex, variable, and adaptable for sin- gular therapeutic approaches. In fact, cancer has so many faces that its early symptoms can include anything from a minor cough or excess shedding to occa- sional diarrhea. Just as varied is the list of possible causes—it seems that everything science looks at closely enough (foods, environmental toxins, natural and syn- thetic chemicals) carries the potential of causing cancer. When cancer has progressed to a point where the diagnosis is certain, cur- ative treatment is often less effective. But, if the disease is caught in its earliest stages, the prognosis can be quite posi- tive. Effective prevention and treatment of cancer must begin with the guardian’s intimate familiarity with his or her ani- mal. Nobody offers more diagnostic insight into cancer than the person who keeps a detailed observational diary of his or her companion animal. The diary should include lifelong records of illnesses or odd behavior or appearances. More important, though, it should reflect what the animal is like dur- ing times of optimal health. The guardian’s capacity to notice minor devi- ations from perfect health is the most powerful tool in the early treatment of cancer and most other types of chronic disease. Following are a few common warning signs the Veterinary Cancer Society rec- ommends that pet owners look for in dogs. These symptoms apply to other animals as well. Remember, nothing here represents a conclusive diagnosis of can- cer, but any symptoms listed should illu- minate a red “check engine” light: • abnormal swellings that continue to grow, especially in the lymph • sores that do not heal • bleeding or discharge from the mouth, nose, urinary tract, vagina, or rectum • offensive odor • difficulty eating or swallowing • difficulty breathing • difficulty urinating or defecating • hesitation to exercise or loss of energy • loss of appetite, weight loss • persistent lameness or stiffness of movement • lumps in the mammary glands • abnormalities or difference in size of testicles All of these symptoms may represent a cancer that has developed beyond its early stages, and therefore the animal should be taken to a holistic veterinarian immediately. Herbs for Pets 224 What might be indicative of the earli- est onset of cancer? Well, just about any- thing out of the ordinary: a chronic cough or skin problem, decreased ener- gy, aggression, pain, or stiffness—the list of early symptoms is endless. This doesn’t mean you should live in constant fear of your companion developing cancer, but you should remain aware that a change that appears to be minor can develop into a serious condition. Don’t ignore any changes in your animal. If a minor prob- lem persists, consult a veterinarian. All forms of cancer share a common characteristic: the disease starts when atypical cells begin reproducing and invading other cells. As healthy cells are destroyed and replaced by cancerous ones, lesions and tumors form and the body structures they occupy become dysfunctional. Many holistic healers theorize that cancer is not really an acquired disease but rather the result of a metabolic imbalance that has progressed out of control. Cancerous tumors begin as small pinpoint lesions that occur off and on throughout an animal’s lifetime. In most cases, the immune system is able to stop the tumors before they develop their own blood supply and begin consuming cell structures elsewhere in the body. But if the body is not in homeostasis (a state of balanced, harmonious health), it may not be able to eliminate the tumor before it takes control of its surroundings and a malignancy results. From this holistic per- spective, carcinogenic compounds, excess ultraviolet light and radiation, and other substances that are said to cause cancer are not seen as “carriers” of the disease but as triggering or encouraging mechanisms. The potential for cancer exists within every animal (human and otherwise). The key to preventing it lies inside a healthy body, not only in the outside influences that we consider threats. Perhaps you have noticed (as we have) that a disproportionate number of seem- ingly healthy people develop cancer despite all external efforts to avoid it. Why is this? It is because despite all the measures they may have taken toward eliminating potential carcinogens from their lives, deeper issues of physical, emo- tional, and spiritual health have not been addressed, and the people have fallen from homeostasis. None of this is to say that we should disregard the existence of carcinogenic substances in food, water, and the envi- ronment. To the contrary, every effort should be made to become aware of and eliminate cancer-causing factors in our lives and the lives of our animals. But we must also provide our bodies with the proper elements of nutrition and sys- temic support that are needed to main- tain homeostasis and prevent cancer. Furthermore, the immune system must be properly equipped and always ready to respond to a nearly infinite number of cancer-causing influences. It must be allowed to do its job without interference from antibiotics, immune-suppressing corticosteroid drugs, and vaccine thera- pies. Every time we interfere with natural immune system functions we may be compromising the body’s ability to respond to and correct cellular or immune system imbalances that could develop into cancer. WHEN CANCER OCCURS The immune system represents the most complete form of disease intervention on earth. If allowed or enabled to function, it is infinitely more efficient than any- thing human beings can comprehend, much less devise. When cancer takes hold, the body’s defenses need all of their resources to fight it. The holistic approach to cancer begins, then, by pro- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 225 viding the body with every opportunity to perform optimally. This means supply- ing it with supplemental measures of nutritional and systemic support. Several diet programs have been designed to strengthen and support ani- mals with cancer. Many involve foods that are rich in fiber and antioxidant compounds. Intensive vitamin, mineral, and other supplemental therapies are often employed as well. These typically include vitamins A, B complex, C, and E, as well as selenium, iron, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), EFAs, digestive enzymes, and dimethylglycine. The best anticancer diet for your animal is one tailored specifical- ly to his individual needs by a holistic vet- erinarian who is familiar with treating the disease. HERBAL THERAPIES Herbs play important roles in supporting the body in its effort to rid itself of can- cer. Herbal therapies focus on tonic sup- port of organs and systems that have special significance in the fight. Because cancer is so variable, it’s difficult to gen- eralize an herbal approach. Every case of cancer is different, as are the metabolic requirements of each animal who has cancer. But a good starting point for herbal treatment of all animals with can- cer is to support the liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system—the body’s waste fil- tering and elimination systems. By help- ing the body cleanse itself, the immune system is less encumbered with cleanup chores and better able to fight cancer. The infamous Essiac and Hoxsey formulas were designed for this purpose. Although the formulas for both have likely been changed several times over the past years, each contains an array of alterative and cholagogue herbs that are targeted toward cleaning the blood, improving digestion, and eliminating waste (prima- rily via the digestive tract). The Essiac for- mula is commonly marketed in health food stores. The Hoxsey formula is available in var- ious interpretations most of which con- tain at least six different herbs. Some herbalists, however, believe that the orig- inal formula contained only two: red clover and burdock. Red clover is at the top of our list of anticancer herbs because it inhibits the activities of carcinogenic compounds, helps improve blood structure, and strengthens lymphatic functions that are crucial in cleansing cell tissues through- out the body. It also contains sterol con- stituents that may inhibit the production of blood vessels that supply and support newly formed tumors. Alfalfa provides similar alterative activities, but we don’t know yet if it possesses the same tumor- inhibiting properties as red clover. Burdock and dandelion root provide gentle stimulation to the liver, thus improving digestion and the removal of waste. These herbs do not cause added strain upon the filtering organs, and therefore they can be used continuously over a long period. In situations in which toxic buildup of systemic waste must be Red clover has many anticancer and tumor-inhibiting properties. Herbs for Pets 226 eliminated quickly in order to liberate the immune system, yellow dock serves as a much stronger liver stimulant and in fact is known as a traditional remedy for heavy metal toxicity (it is also a laxative). Milk thistle may be helpful for protecting the liver against harmful by-products of the cancer or from damage that may result after protracted drug therapies. Diuretic herbs may also aid in removal of systemic waste via the kidneys and uri- nary tract. At the top of the diuretic list are dandelion leaf and nettle. These herbs stimulate urine production and provide potassium and other minerals that need to be continually replaced throughout the cleansing process. To help remove toxic waste, slippery elm, marshmallow, flaxseed, and plantain serve as useful devices for lubricating, pro- tecting, and reducing inflammation of mucous membranes throughout the uri- nary and digestive tracts. If poor liver func- tion has caused chronic constipation, fre- quent small doses of turkey rhubarb tinc- ture (0.25 milliliters per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight, three times daily) serve as an effective laxative. It should be limited to as-needed, short-term use because it can cause diarrhea, intestinal cramping, and other discomforts. Immunostimulant herbs may help boost your companion’s immune response to the cancer. Astragalus is especially well suited for this purpose because it adds energy-boosting adapto- genic qualities to its immunostimulant properties in cancer-debilitated animals. Garlic is another excellent immune sys- tem tonic to consider. While boosting production of killer T cells and other immune system components, it has also been shown to trigger enzyme responses that help break down waste materials before they enter the bloodstream. Once the specific characteristics of the cancer have been identified and correlat- ed with the animal’s holistic needs and cancer-fighting abilities, herbal medi- cines may be administered directly against the cancer. As we mentioned ear- lier, this approach requires the experi- ence of a trained professional who is used to recognizing and treating cancer. Many herbal devices have shown great promise in combating specific forms of cancer. Acemannan, a compound derived from aloe vera, has been shown to be effective A TONIC SUPPORT FORMULA FOR ANIMALS WITH CANCER Combine the following low-alcohol (glycerin) herb tinctures: 2 parts red clover 1 part astragalus 1 part dandelion root 1 part garlic This formula can be fed to the ani- mal continuously over a long peri- od: 0.5 milliliters per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, three times daily. If constipation is part of your animal’s problem, try adding 2 parts marshmallow to the formula. If this fails to bring results, add 1 part yellow dock. If that doesn’t work, try substituting the yellow dock with turkey rhubarb. If liver damage is evident or a threat, twice-daily doses of milk thistle may be fed in addition to this formula to help repair and protect the liver. A stan- dardized milk thistle preparation that contains at least 70 percent sily- marin constituents is best for repair- ing an already damaged liver. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 227 against fibrosarcoma and FeLV. It is theo- rized that acemannan triggers an increase in the immune attack upon the viruses believed to cause these usually fatal dis- eases. An intravenous drug called Carnivora is derived from the Venus’s fly- trap plant for treatment of malignant tumors. Although it has not been approved for use in North America as of 1999, Carnivora has shown some incredi- ble tumor-reducing results in Europe. Herbalists have also seen good results from the use of violet leaf extract in the treatment of certain cancers. It, too, is believed to have tumor-reducing qualities. Cardiovascular Problems In contrast with the vast array of cardio- vascular disorders that loom over their human guardians, animals have little risk of contracting heart or arterial dis- ease during the first three-quarters of their lives. Strokes and heart attacks are almost unheard of in dogs and cats sim- ply because their bodies are naturally designed to metabolize the meat and animal fats that send many of their caretakers to an early grave. This does- n’t mean that animals aren’t susceptible to the ills of chemical preservatives, excess sodium, and refined sugar. Nor does it mean their cardiovascular sys- tems are more resilient to abuse or neg- lect. It means only that unhealthy foods, chemicals, and environmental influences may have a different effect on our companion animals than they do on us. Simply put, a dog or cat on a low-quality, poorly digestible commer- cial diet is far more likely to die from kidney failure than arteriosclerosis. On the same note, an animal’s cardiovascu- lar system will fail, just as ours will, unless all requirements of good nutri- tion, exercise, and environmental quali- ty are met. The heart and vascular system oper- ates continuously and under constant pressure throughout an animal’s life. Factors such as excessive body fat, chronic illness, secondhand smoke, and aging add to the stress and inevitable wear and tear of this vital system. Unlike us, however, our companions have little choice in how their cardiovascular health is maintained—that determina- tion is left up to us. DIET AND EXERCISE: THE HEART OF HEART HEALTH Cardiovascular health all begins with a complete diet. The heart consists of spe- cially adapted smooth muscles and con- nective tissues that must perform opti- mally throughout every moment during an animal’s life; therefore, the heart needs to be continually fed and repaired. The vascular system must remain strong, free of obstructions, and responsive to the body’s needs. It, too, must be contin- ually supplied with the tools and fuel needed for self-maintenance and flawless function. A big problem arises, however, when an animal is afforded only an aver- age “maintenance diet” for subsistence. The cardiovascular system’s nutritional Ginkgo helps to increase circulation. Herbs for Pets 228 daily requirements are never static but instead are continually fluctuating and changing as challenges arise. This means that no single commercial diet, no matter how complete, organic, or digestible it might be, can contain all of the nutrition- al elements your companion’s heart needs on a day-to-day basis. The only way to be sure that your ani- mal is receiving the nutrition needed for good cardiovascular health is to provide a diversity of fresh whole foods through- out his life. Supplemental vitamins, min- erals, and EFAs also help assure that your companion’s cardiovascular system is getting the special considerations it needs. Amino acids are especially impor- tant, as they serve as the protein building blocks of smooth-muscle development and repair. Cats must have taurine in their diets, and dogs must have a suffi- cient supply of l-carnitine, or degenera- tive heart disease (idiopathic dilated car- diomyopathy) may result. Coenzyme Q10 also plays important roles in prevention and treatment of heart problems. It has been shown to help protect the heart muscle from damage secondary to hypoxia, infection, and inflammation. CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS IN DOGS AND CATS In cats, the most common form of nonin- herited (acquired) heart disease is hyper- trophic cardiomyopathy, an enlargement of the left ventricular wall and septum that reduces the heart’s functional ability to pump blood. In dogs, the most com- mon form of acquired heart disease is valvular degeneration in which the heart valves fail to completely close when they should, causing an audible (with a stethoscope) heart murmur and decreased cardiac output. This condition can lead to poor circulation to the extremities, the formation of blood clots in the veins and arteries, and congestive heart failure. In both dogs and cats, acquired cardiomyopathy is most likely to occur in middle-aged or older animals. Animals may suffer from inherited forms of heart disease as well. In dogs, one of the most common is patent duc- tus arteriosus, a congenital defect (most commonly seen in miniature poodles and German shepherds) that essentially amounts to a leak between chambers of the heart. In cats, congenital defects in the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart are fairly common. Other forms of cardiovascular disease may be secondary to bacterial, proto- zoan, or viral infection. Congestive heart failure, a condition in which high pres- sure in the left atrium of the heart causes a backup of fluid into the pulmonary cap- illaries and lungs, is common in obese or geriatric animals or those with heart defects or dysfunction. Animals with heart problems may exhibit shortness of breath, coughing, and diminished physical stamina. Further examination may reveal cardiac arrhyth- mia, pulmonary edema, or blood pres- sure problems. If you suspect that your animal companion has a heart problem, you should get him to a holistic veterinar- ian right away. HERBAL THERAPIES The herbal approach to heart disorders is to strengthen and support cardiovascular and pulmonary function and efficiency. Tonic herbal therapies are especially help- ful in older animals who need a gentle measure of daily cardiovascular support. In all cases, a daily supplement of hawthorn helps improve coronary blood flow, moderate blood pressure, and strengthen heartbeat. Garlic may also be of benefit. Ginkgo, yarrow, or cayenne should also be considered to help increase circulation in the extremities, brain, and throughout the peripheral An Herbal Repertory for Animals 229 capillaries of the body. If rapid, erratic heartbeat is part of your companion’s dis- order, bugleweed may be useful to safely slow and strengthen the heart. If myocar- dial inflammation or pulmonary edema is present (such as with congestive heart failure), a daily regimen of strong dande- lion leaf tea helps remove excess fluid from the body. At the same time, it sup- plies the body with potassium, a mineral that is essential to healthy heart function. Adaptogenic herbs such as astragalus or Siberian ginseng may increase overall energy levels in the animal. Astragalus is also known to have antiviral qualities that are specific to heart infections. Echinacea or other immunostimulant herbs are indi- cated in circumstances where bacterial or viral infection is involved. Digestive System Problems We are all familiar with the sounds and sights of an animal suffering from diges- tive upset—and with cleaning up the aftermath. This is not a pleasant part of taking care of animals, but it’s a fact of life, nonetheless. It’s normal for a healthy animal to vomit or get diarrhea on occasion. Dogs and cats may intuitively induce vomiting by eating grass or other plants. This action serves to cleanse the stomach. Diarrhea may occur if your animal eats something that he is not accustomed to or eats too much of something that his body doesn’t need, such as salty food that was sneaked beneath the dinner table. Vomiting and diarrhea are usually harmless and self-correcting, but they could also be symptoms of a much more serious condition. Digestive upset could be indicative of a parasite imbalance, pancreatitis, colitis, giardiasis, ulcers, liver dysfunction, bacte- rial or protozoan infection, or even can- cer. This leads us back to what holistic animal healing is all about: caring about your animal enough to recognize the dif- ference between an isolated incident and a serious illness. THE REALITY OF DIGESTIVE UPSET Human nature dictates that anything unpleasant to any of the human senses must be immediately suppressed or ignored. To think about vomit or diar- rhea, much less look at what it contains, is virtually taboo. Humanity’s aversion toward secondhand food material is a limiting factor in the holistic care of ani- mals. If we are to care for beloved com- panions who cannot articulate how they feel, we must learn to set aside this aver- sion long enough to consider fully what vomiting and having diarrhea might actually mean in terms of their health. Is A CARDIOVASCULAR TONIC Combine the following glycerin tinctures: 2 parts hawthorn 2 parts dandelion leaf 1 part yarrow 1 part ginkgo An appropriate dose for dogs, cats, and other small animals is 0.05–1.0 milliliter for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight daily. Horses and other large herbivores can receive 20–30 milliliters daily. If more practical, horses and other large herbivores can be fed 1–2 liters of the fresh herbs daily (in lieu of the tincture formula). In addition to this formula, dietary supplementation of garlic may be of benefit to the animal. Herbs for Pets 230 that mess on the sofa just a wad of grass or a hair ball, or does it contain blood (which sometimes looks like coffee grounds), worms, or thick yellow dis- charge? Forcing yourself to thoroughly examine the mess rather than covering it up immediately with half a roll of paper towels might make the difference between health and sickness for your companion. The conventional way of dealing with digestive upset is to suppress the uncom- fortable or unpleasant symptoms. For diarrhea, there are stool hardeners. For constipation, there are laxatives. For vomiting, there are antiemetic drugs. But from a holistic perspective, the para- mount question of what caused the problem in the first place remains unan- swered with these approaches. In fact, stopping the body’s efforts to purge itself may do more harm than good. If your animal is experiencing chronic diarrhea or is vomiting but is exhibiting no other signs of disease, try changing his diet. Oftentimes when an animal is placed on a natural diet, these occur- rences are greatly diminished or eliminat- ed altogether. Food supplementation with digestive probiotics and enzymes often helps too. If your animal’s stool or vomit looks odd or if the situation is severe or persistent, see your veterinarian immediately. APPETITE LOSS (ANOREXIA) AND MALABSORPTION Loss of appetite in animals is seen in many different illnesses. It can be very dangerous for cats, who may suffer from hepatic lipidosis, a degenerative condi- tion where the liver becomes congested and dysfunctional from a rapid buildup of fat. A cat with hepatic lipidosis loses his ability to use stored fat, and as a result, the body utilizes its own muscle mass as a source of protein. About 35 percent of cats with this disease eventu- ally die from it. If your companion chooses not to eat, don’t jump to conclusions and panic. For various reasons, some animals may natu- rally decide to fast. Fasting should be allowed if it doesn’t continue for more than a few days and as long as the animal seems healthy in all other ways. Keep a close eye for signs of weakness, weight loss, fever, runny eyes, or any other signs of ill health. If after a few days of fasting your companion is still turning up his nose to his favorite treats, assume that something is wrong—even if he seems otherwise healthy—and get to a vet! A gum or tooth infection, ulcers of the mouth, periods of strenuous exer- cise, or warm weather may cause decreased appetite. Intestinal parasites, digestive ulcers, tumors or other masses, digestive flora imbalances, bacterial or fungal infections, and liver dysfunction are just a few causes of appetite loss. Your companion also may be depressed or simply bored with his diet. In other words, the possibilities are endless and some are life threatening. If your com- panion isn’t eating and you can’t pin- point the cause on your own within a few days, the best course of action is to consult your holistic veterinarian for medical help. It’s difficult to generalize about how to approach appetite loss because the possible causes are too diverse and extensive. It is safe to say, however, that vitamins, probiotics, and enzyme supple- ments play important roles in animals who aren’t cleaning their plates. In addi- tion, a few herbs stand out in their abili- ties to stimulate appetite and improve nutrient absorption in the digestive sys- tems of some animals. One such herb is yucca, which contains saponin con- stituents that are believed to increase nutrient permeability in the small intes- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 231 tine while at the same time stimulating appetite. By improving the absorption of nutrients, animals who are eating less are able to make the best use of the food they do eat. Alfalfa is another herb to consider—it is nutritious and is also regarded as an appetite stimulant in ani- mals. Both yucca and alfalfa should be used in moderation (especially with hors- es), as they may actually cause digestive upset or bloat if fed in too much abun- dance. Bitter herbs such as gentian, dan- delion, and Oregon grape may help get the digestive juices flowing to trigger an increase in appetite, as might pepper- mint, fennel, or garlic. COLIC AND FLATULENCE The term colic is generic, referring to any condition that causes pain, inflam- mation, or other discomfort in the colon. Most commonly, colic is caused by flatulence (trapped gas), which is usually associated with abdominal dis- tention and irritability. Colic is most often caused by something the animal ingested, but bacterial, fungal, or para- sitic infection may also be the cause, as could a deficiency in liver or gallbladder functions or an ulcer, a tumor, or an injury somewhere in the digestive tract. Regardless of the onset, colic can be especially serious in horses—so serious that herbs may not act fast enough to prevent a life-threatening situation. If your horse is suffering from colic, call your vet immediately! To find a long-term solution to colic (especially chronic, recurring cases), you must first identify the underlying causes. Then and only then can a holistic, long- term solution be found. Until you find the answer, it is possible to relieve the uncomfortable symptoms of colic with herbs. The first course of remedial action is to aid in the elimination of excess gas and help reduce pain and spasms in the colon. Chamomile, fennel, dill, catnip, or peppermint are all good choices for this. If inflammation appears to be part of the problem, slippery elm, plantain, marsh- mallow, raspberry leaf, certified organic goldenseal, or nettle may help. If an ulcer is suspected, licorice lends antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that are especially well suited for the problem. If giardiasis, E. coli, or some other form of parasitic, bacterial, or fungal infection is part of the problem, consider combining Oregon grape or goldenseal tincture with an equal amount of licorice tincture (0.5–1 milliliter for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, twice daily). This helps inhibit the invading microbes while speeding the healing of digestive mucosa. Fresh echinacea can be especial- ly helpful for horses suffering from colic of bacterial origin—allow the animals to eat as much of the fresh plants (roots, flowers, and all) as they intuitively desire. DIARRHEA Diarrhea is caused by an overabundance of fluid entering the intestinal tract. This in turn can interfere with the digestion process and may result in malabsorption Dill expels intestinal gas and soothes the stomach. Herbs for Pets 232 and severe dehydration if left unad- dressed. From a holistic perspective, diar- rhea is a by-product of systemic dysfunc- tion or the body’s effort to deal with some form of excess. Normally, nutrients pass through intestinal mucous mem- branes to enter the bloodstream. To aid in this metabolic process, the mem- branes allow a measured amount of water, bile, and other digestive fluids to enter the intestinal tract from the oppo- site direction (from the body). When too much fluid is allowed to enter the intes- tinal tract for whatever reason, loose stool is the result. Conversely, when too little fluid is allowed into the intestinal tract, constipation occurs. The standard, symptomatic ap- proach to diarrhea is to inhibit the entrance of fluid into the intestinal tract. This is usually accomplished with the use of astringent herbs or drugs—those that cause contraction (shrinking) of mucous membranes. By quickly shrink- ing intestinal membranes, excess fluid is prohibited from entering the digestive tract, and the stool firms up. If herbs are the medicine of choice, those contain- ing large amounts of tannin con- stituents, such as uva ursi, rose bark, or white oak bark, are generally the quick- est acting. The problem is that these and most other “tannin heavyweights” can be irritating to the stomach and kid- neys and therefore must be used only for a short duration—about a day or two at a time. The better approach is to be patient. Try gentler astringents first, such as chamomile or raspberry leaf. If these fail, try slippery elm or plantain (our favorite)—these herbs combine their tannin constituents with the sooth- ing and protecting effects of mucilage. If these herbs fail, try combining one of the aforementioned astringents with an equal amount of marshmallow root. The soothing, mucilaginous quality of the marshmallow helps moderate the irritat- ing effect of the tannins. With all of that said, it’s now time to reconsider the use of astringents alto- gether. Remember, the goal of holistic herbal medicine is to assist the body in its abilities to correct and heal itself. When we use astringent herbs to treat diarrhea, we are only suppressing the body’s response to deeper problems. Plus, we have to consider that the diar- rhea actually might be part of the body’s natural healing process. The bot- tom line is this: if your animal is suffer- ing from a sudden onset of diarrhea, try to make lifestyle arrangements that allow you to live with the situation for a day or two—until it passes. Encourage your animal to drink plenty of water, restrict salt intake, and let nature take its course. If bacterial infection or giar- A BASIC FORMULA FOR COLIC Combine the following ingredients either as teas, tinctures, or dried herbs: 1 part fennel seed 1 part marshmallow root 1 part chamomile An appropriate starting dose for most dogs is either 1 tablespoon of the dried herbs, 1 milliliter of a low- alcohol tincture combination, or 2 tablespoons of a strong tea sprin- kled on a small amount of food, twice daily. Cats should receive half of the dog dose. Horses and other herbivores can be fed 2–4 cups of the dried herbs or 4–8 cups of the fresh herbs daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 233 diasis is the suspected cause, Oregon grape or certified organic goldenseal might help solve the problem. Regardless of what you might suspect, if the problem persists or worsens, take your companion to a holistic vet for a thorough examination. At the very least, have the stool analyzed for the presence of blood, worms, or other evidence of deeper health problems, and be sure that the animal is drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Once the underlying causes are identified, a holistic course of action can be directed at the root cause (not the symptoms) of the problem. CONSTIPATION Constipation is usually caused when the body is unable to fully digest food or when other materials cause a blockage. If an animal is receiving a healthy, well-bal- anced diet, constipation should not be a problem, and contrary to what many conventional dog and cat care texts may say, a healthy diet should include fresh raw bones from an organic source, if pos- sible. The idea that raw bones cause digestive blockages in dogs and cats is untrue, at least if the animal is healthy to start with. Carnivores are naturally designed to digest and metabolize bones. If they can’t digest them and con- stipation occurs, it’s because their diges- tive system is not working efficiently (or perhaps they’re eating too many bones). In treating constipation, the first step is to rule out the possibility that your companion ate something he shouldn’t have—such as a piece of wood; pine nee- dles; some tough dry grass; or perhaps that heirloom tapestry that was handed down through your family for fifteen generations. If ingestion of “something different” is ruled out, then look deeper for some sort of interrelated problem. Start with a thorough reevaluation of diet and make sure that your animal is receiv- ing the enzymes and probiotics needed for healthy digestive flora. Try feeding your companion some organic, live-cul- tured yogurt. Eating yogurt activates reproduction of digestive flora and often has quick and natural laxative effects. If the animal is straining to pass stool, then some ground flaxseed, psyllium husk, or marshmallow root might help lubricate the intestines. Feed 1⁄4 teaspoon of any of these herbs for each 20 pounds of an animal’s weight along with plenty of water. Fresh chickweed can be fed to horses, goats, llamas, dogs, cats, birds, and other animals for a gentle laxative and soothing effect. A TONIC FORMULA FOR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION Combine the following as either dried herbs, low-alcohol tinctures, or strong teas: 2 parts dandelion root 2 parts marshmallow root 1 part Oregon grape 1 part yellow dock 1 part fennel (to relieve any associated gas or griping) *This diet should be supplemented with flaxseed or psyllium husks. For dogs, try 1 teaspoon of the strong, combined, cooled teas or 1 milliliter of the tincture per 30 pounds of body weight, two or three times daily. Cats can receive 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon of the strong, combined, cooled teas or 0.25–0.50 milliliters of the tincture per 15 pounds of body weight, two or three times daily. Herbs for Pets 234 Chronic constipation is often a cumu- lative effect of liver or gallbladder con- gestion or dysfunction. If bile production is reduced in the liver, or if the gallblad- der or a bile duct is blocked by solid waste or inflammation, then the diges- tive tract cannot receive the chemicals it needs to effectively break down food materials. The result is constipation. Again, this condition is usually caused by one or more elements of the diet (such as low-grade protein or too much fat) that cannot be effectively digested and metabolized. Aside from a change in diet, the herbal approach is to improve bile production and transport with chol- agogue herbs such as dandelion root and Oregon grape. If the problem is believed to be associated with liver damage or inflammation, milk thistle, turmeric, or licorice should be added to the program to help protect and regenerate liver cells. Essential fatty acids, such as those found in the oils of flaxseed, evening primrose, and borage, serve critical roles in liver repair as well. By now you may have noticed that we have not mentioned the use of laxative herbs. This is because constipation is almost always a by-product of a deeper problem for which a laxative can serve only as a symptomatic quick fix. The strongest laxative herbs are those con- taining anthraquinone constituents. Anthraquinones stimulate peristalsis— spasmodic smooth-muscle contractions of the bowels. In effect, these spasms force stool out of the body, causing uncomfortable cramping, griping pain, gas, and loss of smooth-muscle tone. With long-term use, laxatives can even cause digestive dependency (i.e., your animal will not be able to pass stool with- out the laxative). Since the holistic approach to animal health is focused on assisting (as opposed to forcing) the body with its natural functions, strong laxatives such as senna, aloe, cascara sagrada, and turkey rhubarb should be reserved for times when all else fails and bowel movement is an immediate neces- sity. Before resorting to any of these herbs, give yellow dock a try. Although it too contains considerable amounts of anthraquinones, it tends to be much more gentle, and it imparts liver and digestive stimulating qualities that add to its value in treating constipation. We find it especially effective when used in small proportions with liver tonic herbs, such as dandelion root. Finally, when encountering constipa- tion in pregnant animals, the safest approach is to avoid anything that con- tains anthraquinones. Instead, look to marshmallow, chickweed, flaxseed, or psyllium husks to provide colonic lubrica- tion without stressing the reproductive organs or the fetus. Horses and other herbivores seldom get constipated, but they commonly suf- fer from various other forms of colic. When these animals do get constipated, it’s usually attributable to poor-quality feed or forage or to the ingestion of sand, gravel, and other nonorganic materials. In these circumstances, dietary supple- mentation with a few tablespoons of ground or finely chopped marshmallow, flaxseed, or psyllium husks usually assist with elimination. HAIR BALLS Anyone who has been licked by a cat knows that felines have rough, “barbed” tongues. This makes it difficult for them to spit hair out after each of their hun- dred or so daily baths, so they must swal- low the hair. This in turn may lead to vomiting and the possibility of intestinal obstructions. One conventional approach to hair balls is to feed the affected cat some petroleum jelly, a practice we feel is espe- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 235 cially dangerous because the jelly, being totally insoluble in water, can be aspirat- ed into the lungs of a choking or vomit- ing cat and cause life-threatening pneu- monia. Other approaches employ laxa- tives, the theory being that the hair balls can be expeditiously eliminated out the opposite end of the kitty. Again we frown—the poor cat is having a tough enough time without suffering a caretak- er-induced case of intestinal cramping and diarrhea. Fortunately, there are some safe and effective actions you can take to help your feline eliminate hair balls more easi- ly. Foremost is a well-balanced, raw food diet. Raw meats, bones, and vegetables contain the fiber and roughage necessary to bind with ingested hair and carry it out of the body. Giving 1⁄4 teaspoon of bran, psyllium husks, or ground flaxseed also provides fiber and lubricating mucilage to help remove hair balls. Giving 1⁄2 teaspoon of marshmallow root tea or 12–20 drops of the glycerin tinc- ture will likely help lubricate the process as well. If your cat will eat marshmallow root au natural, 1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon of fresh or dried root can be finely chopped and added to Kitty’s food for a similar effect. Adding a teaspoon of olive oil to the food can be helpful too. For rabbits who get intestinal obstruc- tions of fur, a common practice by some rabbit caretakers is to feed pineapple juice to “melt” the fur away. The fur pass- ing more easily is probably due to the enzymatic action of the juice, and sup- plementing with digestive enzymes would most likely work in a similar fash- ion when used as a preventative. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Inflammatory bowel disease and colitis involve mucosal inflammation of the colon. Animals with inflammatory bowel disease often suffer from severe diarrhea, labored or painful bowel movements, gastric distention, and rectal bleeding or mucus discharge. In cats, the problem is sometimes labeled Crohn’s disease. Causes are often difficult to pinpoint, even with the best diagnostic methods. Immune system disorders, circulatory impairment in the intestinal tract, para- sitic infections, defects in permeability of the intestinal wall, dietary sensitivities, or adverse drug reactions are all part of a long list of causative possibilities. Conventional approaches to inflam- matory bowel disease include feeding a controlled diet that may include supple- mental dietary fiber and the use of corti- costeroids and other immunosuppressive drugs. In cats, inflammation is often treated with sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), a compound that is also used in humans for similar disorders. Natural therapies usually start with adjustments in diet and supplementation with vitamins and probiotics that support digestion and moderate immune system activities. A daily regimen of n-acetylglu- cosamine (250–1,500 milligrams), glut- amine (250–3,000 milligrams), Lacto- bacillus acidophilus (20–500 million microorganisms), proanthocyanidin complex (10–200 milligrams), dimethyl- glycine (50–250 milligrams), and vita- min C (250–3000 milligrams) represents one suggested nutritional therapy for dogs and cats. Papaya supplements may also prove beneficial in improving diges- tion, but care must be taken to assure that any or all of these supplements do not cause or worsen diarrhea. The symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease can often be relieved with the same herbs we recommend for treating gastritis. Because reduction of mucosal inflammation is of critical importance, anti-inflammatory and demulcent herbs such as licorice, slip- pery elm, plantain, marshmallow, Herbs for Pets 236 flaxseed, and psyllium husks may be especially useful. Aloe vera juice or cal- endula may also relieve the discomforts of inflammatory bowel disease. Certified organic goldenseal may help to reduce mucosal inflammation. Astragalus is well suited for immune support in cases in which infection may be involved because it tends not to overstimulate the immune system when an increased autoimmune response may already be a contributing factor in the inflammation. LEAKY GUT SYNDROME (INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS AND HYPERPERMEABILITY) Leaky gut is a term used for a condition in which food compounds abnormally permeate intestinal barriers to enter the bloodstream. Oftentimes, this leads to an immediate defensive attack by the immune system and severe food aller- gies. In some cases, systemic infection, arthritis, seborrhea, or other forms of autoimmune disease may result. Leaky gut syndrome has many causes, any number of which may be secondary to another. Poor diet; excessive use of antibiotic drugs; or bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infections may alter digestive flora to the point that intestinal mucosal barri- ers will be vulnerable and weakened by certain food-carried chemicals. The prob- lem may also be caused by chronic inflammatory bowel disease—when the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, its structur- al integrity may be altered in a way that allows unusually large food particles, bac- teria, parasites, fungi (such as Candida albicans), or protozoa to cross intestine- blood barriers. The most effective approach to avoid leaky gut is with a natural diet that con- tains all of the probiotic elements neces- sary for healthy digestive flora, struc- ture, and function. Research has shown that glutamine, a fatty acid component, plays important roles in maintaining gut tonicity, thus reducing the possibility of leaky gut. One study concluded that animals deprived of glutamine were more likely to suffer sepsis, bacterial infection of the blood. Leaky gut can be progressive and debilitating shortly after onset. The holistic approach toward correcting the problem is to provide supplemental measures of digestive probiotics to build intestinal flora and strengthen mucosal barriers. Plantain, marshmallow, rasp- berry leaf, certified organic goldenseal, and chamomile can be used to reduce inflammation, tonify intestinal mucosa, and provide an additional barrier against invading microbes. Flaxseed is also strongly indicated, as it provides A FORMULA FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Combine the following as either teas, tinctures, or dried herbs: 2 parts slippery elm or plantain 1 part marshmallow root 1 part licorice 1 part fennel seed For dogs, 1 tablespoon of the dried herbs, 1 milliliter of a low-alcohol tincture combination, or 2 table- spoons of a strong tea can be fed twice daily. Cats should receive half the dog dose. Horses and other her- bivores can be fed 2–4 cups of the dried herbs or 4–8 cups of the fresh herbs daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 237 soothing, cleansing, and protective mucilage and fiber constituents as well as an added measure of mucosa- strengthening omega-3 fatty acids. Ear Problems Ear problems most commonly come in the form of bacterial or fungal infections, mites, fleas, or foreign objects (foxtails, dirt, etc.) lodged in the ear canal. Some other com- mon problems include hematoma of the earflap and tumors of the inner ear. Mullein flower, Oregon grape, garlic, marshmallow, ginkgo, and yarrow are especially well suited for treating infec- tions and parasite infestations of the ear. Mullein flower, garlic, and Oregon grape are all strong antimicrobials with strong affinities toward inhibition of mites and various pathogens that may cause ear problems. The slippery oily mucilage of marshmallow root provides soothing relief and a protective, antimicrobial bar- rier on inflamed tissues of the outer ear. Yarrow is especially useful for treating small hematomas of the earflap. Used externally, the oil helps strengthen exteri- or capillary walls, while internal doses of yarrow and ginkgo tea or tincture improve capillary circulation and internal tonicity. Witch hazel may also be effective for external treatment of earflap hematomas, as its strong astringency quickly constricts weak or inflamed blood vessels. Elderly Animal Care What is considered old for a pet? We know that to a certain degree longevity varies with the type, size, and breed of an animal. For example, a small dog may live into his teens, while a larger breed of dog may be entering his golden years at only seven or eight years of age. But for those of us who strive to understand what life must be like from the animal’s perspective, a different question comes to mind: What would our pets them- selves regard as old age? We all grow old. Various body parts become fatigued from oxidation and wear and tear, systemic efficiency begins to decline, and certain bodily functions sim- ply don’t work as well as they used to. But how much of the aging process is actually relative to time and physiological degener- ation, and how much is the result of sur- rendering to the thought of being old and feeble? We raise this question on behalf of the animals who have taught us just how carefree and fun the latter part of life can really be. Unlike humans, animals age without even considering the concepts of mortality and personal vanity, and those of us who pay close enough attention to them can gain some precious insight about what being old really means. ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIPARASITIC EAR OIL Combine equal amounts of the following oil infusions: Mullein flower Oregon grape Garlic Marshmallow You can add 10–20 drops of vitamin E oil to this mixture to act as a pre- servative and aid in skin healing. For ear mites or infections of fungal or bacterial origin, 6–12 drops of the oil can be applied to affected areas of the earflap or ear canal. A soft plastic dropper is best for applica- tion into the ear canal, while a piece of soft cotton, gauze, or even clean fingertips will suffice as an external applicator. Herbs for Pets 238 For humans, old age is as much a product of mind-set as it is of physical cir- cumstances. To animals, the entire idea of “yielding to the wheels of time” does not apply—an elderly animal does not live in anticipation of death but in cele- bration of life. As his human guardians roll their tired old bodies out of bed in the morning and moan, groan, and com- plain about their hemorrhoids, the elder- ly dog waits by the door virtually shout- ing, “Who cares about not having teeth anymore? There’s a squirrel out there and it’s near my doghouse! Let’s go get him!” There are some powerful lessons about life and happiness here. Chronic diseases are often disregard- ed as just a part of growing old. In fact, many pet owners see their animals’ old age as a downhill slide to inevitable suf- fering and death. As a result of this mind- set, countless numbers of animals are euthanized not because their time has naturally passed but because their guardians are fearful of watching the ani- mals grow old and die a natural death. Granted, it’s difficult to live in anticipa- tion of a companion’s death, but all things considered, this is really our prob- lem, not theirs. The fact that an animal is growing old and becoming more susceptible to illness does not automatically predis- pose him to chronic disease, it just means that he needs some added care and attention. With your loving support, your old best friend can enjoy life right up to his last day. We are firm believers that animals who receive plenty of love and atten- tion, a wholesome homemade diet, a minimum of vaccinations, and holistic measures of health care throughout their lives can beat the odds of longevi- ty set by genetics, breeding, and physi- cal size. By affording them the elements of sustained health and well-being, ani- mals reward us before and after they pass from our lives. They leave us with the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their lives were totally ful- filled by kindhearted and respectful human beings who cared enough to allow them to live and age gracefully and innocently—as animals do. HERBAL THERAPIES Most chronic problems seen in elderly animals are the results of poor or incom- plete nutrition. Liver problems, chronic renal failure, diabetes, arthritis and hip dysplasia, and neurological problems (such as canine cognitive dysfunction) are just a few of the conditions that may be prevented by lifelong good nutrition. Tailor a dietary program to your com- Providing your pet with a healthful diet, holistic lifestyle, and a lifetime of love can help him enjoy his later years. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 239 panion’s specific needs as early as possi- ble. Each month of nutritional deficien- cy can trim healthy years from the latter end of your animal’s life. A holistic vet- erinarian can assist you in determining the proper diet and nutrients for the age, physical condition, and lifestyle of your companion. In older animals, herbs are especially useful for providing added support to body functions and systems that are becoming less efficient. Nothing can compare with spirulina or other forms of blue-green algae for tonic nutritional support of an aging body. Astragalus is an especially well-suited general tonic for older animals because it provides a meas- ured degree of immune system support while also strengthening the animal’s resistance to stress. Garlic serves this pur- pose as well, but added care must be exercised in assuring that it does not cause digestive upset in elderly animals. The liver and digestive organs endure a lifetime of abusive environmental tox- ins and systemic waste materials, so it stands to reason that they will eventually begin to fail in the later years of life. To support liver and digestive functions, an animal’s diet should be frequently reeval- uated and adjusted as needed to accom- modate any reduction in these organs’ metabolic capacities. Additionally, diges- tion and waste elimination can be improved with digestive enzymes and mild liver stimulants, such as dande- lion or burdock root. These help with the removal of solid wastes from the body while increasing the production of bile and digestive enzymes. Marshmallow root, fed fresh, dried, or in any form of low-alcohol liquid, aids in the passage of stool by providing a protective, anti-inflammatory, and lubricating barrier to the intestinal mucosa. Flaxseed or psyllium husks work in a similar manner as well. The kidneys have a difficult life too because they must filter and eliminate waste from the blood over the course of a lifetime. Over time they may become scarred and dysfunctional from repetitive infections, stones, and other damaging influences that may or may not have been detected earlier. To increase urinary efficiency and help strengthen mucous membranes in the urinary tract, a tea of dandelion leaf, nettle, cleavers, or parsley leaf can be added to the animal’s drink- ing water—just enough to noticeably tint the water. Giving one of these herbs pro- vides alterative qualities that the animal’s body can selectively utilize to eliminate waste and maintain clean, well-nourished blood. This can be done every day for the remainder of the animal’s life. If the animal displays early symptoms of renal failure, twice-daily doses of gink- go and hawthorn help to improve blood circulation and reduce blood pressure in the kidneys, while corn silk, marshmal- low, and plantain help to reduce any inflammation. Oatstraw serves as an excellent nerv- ous system tonic that can be fed daily to help improve and regulate nerve trans- mission. In animals who display dimin- ished mental clarity or odd behavior that is attributable to brain dysfunction (e.g., cognitive dysfunction in canines) blood circulation and neurological functions of the brain can be assisted and sometimes improved with the use of ginkgo, gotu kola, or peppermint. In certain cases, Saint-John’s-wort may be beneficial as well, but this determination should be made by a holistic veterinarian who is familiar with your animal. Aches, pains, and loss of mobility that result from joint and connective tis- sue degeneration may be relieved with supplements of glucosamine or chon- droitin sulfate, horsetail, or yucca root. In cases of arthritis flare-ups, licorice, Herbs for Pets 240 devil’s claw, or boswellia may bring symptomatic relief. Cardiovascular efficiency can be sup- ported with daily supplementation of hawthorn berries. If circulatory impair- ment is evident in the legs, ears, or tail of the animal, ginkgo, yarrow, or cayenne may be of assistance. The Animal Essentials dry herb and vitamin formula is also a good broad-spectrum daily supplement. WHEN THE END IS NEAR If your companion receives a good diet, plenty of exercise, and a lot of loving attention, chances are excellent that he will live happily to a ripe old age. However, any animal guardian must be prepared for the inevitable end. This can involve the need for you to make the weighty and difficult decision of whether your pet’s death should be kindly assist- ed. This choice is ultimately up to you, and there’s no easy way around it. Recently, there has been some interest in hospices for animals, similar to the hos- pices we are familiar with for people. Vets become involved in the hospice-care team and help teach a caregiver how to maintain and care for an animal who is dying in the home. It can make the dying experience much less confusing for both the animal and his guardian. Endocrine System and Related Problems The endocrine system consists of glandu- lar organs and structures that are situat- ed throughout the body, each of which produces and secretes specific hormones and other substances for distribution via the blood or lymph. The specific sub- stances produced by the various compo- nents of the endocrine system play key roles in activating or regulating organ functions and countless other metabolic activities and balances throughout the body. If one or more components of this complex and interrelated system fails, a chain reaction of dysfunction can be trig- gered throughout the body. Because endocrine system diseases and disorders can affect a wide variety of organs and functions throughout the body, such conditions are easily misdiag- nosed and often written off as behavioral disorders or dietary problems. The insidi- ous nature of endocrine disease is com- pounded by its typically slow progres- sion, and oftentimes a problem is not accurately identified until the animal’s condition is irreversible. This is when lov- ing attentiveness and a well-kept diary by a holistic caregiver can really pay off. By noticing and addressing subtle symp- toms when they first occur, a guardian can take corrective measures against most endocrine system problems before they become life threatening. ADRENAL GLAND DISORDERS The adrenal glands produce various hor- mones that are important in nervous sys- tem functions, regulation of the immune system, and bodily responses to stressful situations. The adrenal cortex (the outer tissues of the adrenal glands) is chiefly responsible for the body’s production of corticosteroids, the hormones responsi- ble for natural control of inflammation. Addison’s Disease (Hypoadrenocorticism) Addison’s disease is caused by deficient secretion of cortisone and other hor- mones from the adrenal cortex. The cause of the disease is unknown, but it may be secondary to an immune system disorder that is responsible for destroying the adrenal glands. Usually the disease progresses slowly, allowing an attentive caregiver to take remedial action early. Secondary hypoadrenocorticism is caused when synthetic corticosteroids An Herbal Repertory for Animals 241 are introduced into the body, natural adrenal functions are replaced, and the adrenal cortex subsequently begins to shut down. Many animals who are finish- ing prednisolone or other steroid thera- pies or animals who have been subjected to excessive vaccinations suffer from this form of hypoadrenocorticism. Addison’s disease occurs most fre- quently in middle-aged female dogs. It rarely occurs in cats. Early symptoms may be subtle and include occasional lack of appetite, digestive upset, and decreased energy and stamina. In many cases, symptoms may be apparent only during or after an activity that causes physical or psychological stress, such as a car ride, a frightening encounter with a big, mean dog, or a dreaded trip to the vet. Symptoms progressively worsen over time until the slightest measure of stress may result in debilitation. Degeneration of the adrenal glands is generally irreversible, but if the nutrients needed for maintaining a healthy body and balanced immune system are provid- ed, progression of the disease can be slowed dramatically. An organic raw food diet, free from pesticide residues, antibi- otics, and livestock growth or milk pro- duction hormones, is likely to yield the best results. Additionally, a high-quality dietary supplement that contains a full complement of vitamins, minerals, and EFAs is strongly indicated. Supplemental feeding of dried nettle, dandelion leaf, or parsley leaf provides the body with an array of vitamins and minerals that are essential in maintaining strong adrenal functions. Any or all of these herbs can be mixed with the animal’s food—1 level teaspoon per pound of food fed daily. Spirulina is also an excellent supplement for adrenal care—1⁄4 teaspoon for each pound of food fed daily. An excellent herb and vitamin supplement called Animal Essentials is well suited for animals that have Addison’s disease or diabetes mellitus. Borage leaf may help gently boost adrenal output, particularly in cases asso- ciated with extended steroid therapies. Licorice offers a much stronger boost to adrenal function. It’s important to note, however, that these herbs only stimulate adrenal function, they do not repair or adequately nourish the glands. Siberian ginseng or other adaptogenic herbs may be useful for reducing the impact of stress upon the adrenal glands. Cushing’s Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism) The opposite of Addison’s disease is Cushing’s disease in which overactive adrenal glands produce too much corti- sone and other hormones. This is most commonly caused (in about 85 percent of all cases) by a malignant or benign tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor causes the pituitary to overproduce a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland, causing Cushing’s disease. The disease may also be caused by excessive use of corticosteroid drugs or by a tumor of one or both adrenal glands. Cushing’s disease occurs in dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. The condition progresses with tumor growth. Symptoms include increased thirst and appetite; increased urination; abdomi- nal distention; increased panting; obe- sity; muscle weakness; hair loss; and dry, scaly, or wrinkled skin. Conventional treatment is based on the diagnosis of the cause. In cases that stem from a pituitary or adrenal gland tumor, surgical removal or drug therapies are both options. The prognosis is vari- able according to the amount of disease progression. Herbal therapy is limited to tonic sup- port of organs and systems that are sub- jected to additional stress because of the Herbs for Pets 242 disease. Dandelion root, burdock, garlic, and nettle are good choices for support- ing an overtaxed liver and digestive sys- tem and to help replace potassium that is lost as a result of increased urination. Adaptogenic herbs such as Siberian gin- seng or astragalus help buffer adrenal responses to stress. Kelp is especially use- ful for maintaining iodine and other trace mineral levels that are essential for adre- nal function. If your companion has Cushing’s disease, avoid licorice, borage leaf, and other herbs that stimulate adre- nal activity. DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes comes in many forms, each requiring specific courses of treatment. To simplify, the most common form of diabetes (diabetes mellitus) occurs when the pancreas becomes dysfunctional and produces too little insulin. Because of this deficit, the body is unable to effectively utilize or store the glucose, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates needed to maintain homeostasis. Consequently, serious im- balances are triggered throughout the body. If left untreated, animals with dia- betes mellitus suffer and are likely to suc- cumb to kidney failure, loss of vision, or any number of autoimmune, heart, or nervous system problems. Unfortunately, there is no cure for dia- betes. Conventional treatment of ad- vanced cases usually involves insulin replacement therapy. This approach can be effective, but all too often other rela- tive factors are never addressed. These factors include special trace mineral or EFA needs that arise from special de- mands placed upon overworked organs, as well as kidney damage that has already occurred from the disease. Diabetic animals should receive regu- lar exercise and good, wholesome food fed in small amounts, several times throughout the day. By ingesting many small meals, the body has an easier time producing, using, and stabilizing insulin and glucose levels. Dietary yeast may be added to the animal’s diet to aid in the metabolism of glucose, and 25 to 200 IU of vitamin E each day may help reduce an animal’s insulin requirement. For dogs and cats, a daily regimen of 50–300 micrograms of chromium; 500–6,000 milligrams of vitamin C; 4–160 mil- ligrams of digestive enzymes; 200–1,500 milligrams of n-acetylglucosamine; and 10–200 milligrams of proanthocyanidin complex may be of benefit as well. Regular exercise is important for main- taining healthy body weight and car- diopulmonary function and may also help decrease the animal’s insulin need. The primary role of herbs in treating diabetes is to help strengthen and sup- port systems of the body that have been ravaged by the metabolic chaos of the disease. Because a diabetic body has a diminished capacity to utilize critical nutrients, herbs that strengthen diges- tion and nutrient absorption are strongly indicated. These include bitter herbs such as dandelion leaf, chamomile (both the leaf and the flower), calendula, and hop. In addition, yucca and alfalfa are useful for increasing absorption of nutri- ents in the small intestine. Dandelion root and burdock root both contain con- siderable amounts of inulin, a compound that helps moderate and maintain blood sugar levels. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) or huckleberry leaf (Vaccinium sp.) may also be effective in moderating glucose levels in the blood, and a few juniper berries added to each feeding may help optimize the body’s utilization of insulin. Cardiovascular and kidney efficiency can be improved with the use of hawthorn and ginkgo. Scientific studies have shown that aloe vera and chemical com- pounds found in fenugreek seeds may also reduce blood glucose levels and An Herbal Repertory for Animals 243 stimulate insulin production in diabetic animals. Animal Essentials is an excellent herb and vitamin supplement for diabet- ic dogs and cats. PANCREATITIS The pancreas produces insulin, a sub- stance that enables the body to utilize and store glucose (the body’s fuel). It also produces pancreatic enzymes that are essential for digesting food and assimilat- ing nutrients in the digestive tract. It is a delicate organ that is easily damaged and slow to heal. Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pan- creas, can result from a high-fat diet, obesity, traumatic injury, or excessive use of corticosteroid, antibiotic, or diuretic drugs. It can also be related to underly- ing systemic problems such as liver, gall- bladder, or kidney disease; cardiovascular disease; or bacterial infection. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, restless- ness, severe vomiting and diarrhea (sometimes with blood present), dimin- ished appetite, and weakness. Onset can occur quickly (acute pancreatitis), or symptoms can progressively worsen over time (chronic pancreatitis). Pancreatitis is most common in middle-aged dogs, especially those who are overweight from being “pampered” with generous junk-food handouts. The disease is less common in cats. Natural treatment of pancreatitis is centered on diet and nutrition. To ease the inflamed organ’s burden, meals should be doled out in small portions and fed three or more times per day. Food should be served with probiotic (e.g., aci- dophilus, bifidus) and enzyme supple- ments at room temperature, which make the food easier for the animal to digest. And excess fat and foods that contribute to digestive upset should be eliminated from the diet. In addition to healthy food and food combining, daily supplements of EFAs such as stabilized flaxseed, fish oils and vitamins A and E are said to help repair and strengthen the pancreas. Meats, grains, vegetables, and fats are digested and absorbed at different meta- bolic rates, the pancreas must produce different enzymes for each. A diseased pancreas may have difficulty producing all the enzymes needed to digest a meal that includes too many food groups; so therefore, pancreatic efficiency can be optimized if each meal is composed of food types that are of similar digestibility. For example, grains and vegetables can be served together, as can grains and fruits or protein (meat) and vegetables. Meat and grains should not be combined during the same meal, however, because their digestion requirements are differ- ent. (For more information on food com- bining, pick up a copy of Keep Your Pet Healthy the Natural Way by Pat Lazarus.) Herbal therapies are best directed toward supporting organs and systems related to pancreatic function and the onset of pancreatitis. A thorough veteri- nary examination is needed to determine which therapy to use. In almost all cases, treatment of pancreatic disease requires tonic support of the liver and digestive system. Milk thistle helps to regenerate and restore normal function to a liver that is damaged as a result of drug ther- apies or infection. Dandelion, burdock root, or Oregon grape can help improve digestion and reduce pancreatic stress by gently increasing bile and enzyme pro- duction in the liver. If bacterial infection is present, echinacea helps to boost the immune system’s response to the invad- ing microbes. Yarrow is said to help reduce pancreatic inflammation and improve blood circulation to the organ. THYROID PROBLEMS The thyroid gland consists of two lobes, one located on each side of the trachea. Herbs for Pets 244 The gland secretes important hormones, including thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin. Release of these hor- mones is controlled by yet another hor- mone, called thyroid stimulating hor- mone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. Thyroid hormones control the intensi- ty of critical functions throughout the body, including heart rate, body temper- ature, fat and glucose metabolism, diges- tion, and neurological activities. If the thyroid becomes dysfunctional, some serious health problems occur. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism occurs when a thyroid tumor, a viral or bacterial infection, or environmental or nutritional factors cause the thyroid gland to secrete excess hormones into the blood. Symptoms may include ravenous appetite, weight loss, increased water consumption and urination, aggressive or hyperactive behavior, and rapid or erratic heartbeat and respiration. The problem occurs more frequently in cats than in dogs or other animals. Conventional treatment of hyperthy- roidism ranges from chemotherapy to surgery to radiation therapy. One approach involves destroying the thyroid completely with radiation and then put- ting the animal on hormone replacement therapy for the rest of his life. Once the thyroid becomes damaged or dysfunctional, its condition is difficult (some say impossible) to reverse. There- fore, the best holistic approach toward hyperthyroidism is to help prevent it by providing a good natural diet and avoid- ing unnecessary chemical or environ- mental hazards, including X-rays, anti- biotic therapies, food preservatives, and unneeded vaccinations. Daily supple- ments of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, CoQ10, and EFAs are also important con- tributors for maintaining healthy thyroid function. Herbal therapies include symptomatic treatment and tonic support of systems that are under added stress from an increased metabolic rate. Bugleweed is considered a specific symptomatic reme- dy for hyperthyroidism because it is known to slow thyroid function by reduc- ing production of TSH. Its use, however, should be monitored by a holistic veteri- narian. Hawthorn is helpful for moderat- ing an erratic heartbeat, while skullcap and valerian may help calm and reduce the “jittery jumpiness” of a hyperthyroid animal. Kelp and other rich sources of iodine should be avoided because iodine stimulates thyroid function. Hypothyroidism The opposite of hyperthyroidism is hypothyroidism—deficient production of hormones by the thyroid. Hypothy- roidism is usually caused by physical degeneration of the thyroid gland, which can be the result of protracted drugs or therapies, radiation such as X-ray expo- sure, vaccinosis, genetic predisposition, or nutritional deficiencies. Hypothyroid- ism occurs rarely in cats and horses or other large animals, but it is fairly com- mon in dogs. Destruction of the thyroid is generally irreversible, and animals who are suffering advanced stages of thyroid degeneration may need hormone re- placement therapy. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain, reduced appetite, mental dullness, lack of energy, hair loss on the trunk and tail, and a dry coat that pulls easily from the skin. If left untreated, the problem can lead to chronic seizures, head tilt, lack of coordination, and other serious neurological disorders. Iodine is critical in the functions of a healthy thyroid, and many holistic practi- tioners believe that dietary supplementa- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 245 tion of iodine-rich kelp helps stimulate an underactive thyroid. Many researchers and practitioners believe, however, that supplemental iodine may contribute to immune-related factors of the disease and trigger a worsening effect. Licorice may have a slight stimulant effect on an unproductive but physically intact thyroid, and adaptogens such as organically grown ginseng, astragalus, or Siberian ginseng might help energy lev- els and the body’s response to stress. Otherwise, herb use is limited to treating the discomforts subsequent to hypothy- roidism. For instance, related digestive disorders can be treated with dandelion root, Oregon grape, or yellow dock, whereas seborrhea might be relieved by gotu kola, burdock, or red clover. In our opinion, homeopathy and the use of glandular preparations offer more effective courses of early- to late-term treatment than herbs do. Epilepsy, Convulsions, and Seizures A seizure can be frightening if you’ve never seen one before. Some animals may experience a seizure once in their lives and then never again. On the other hand, some have several seizures every day of their lives. The causes of seizures are widely var- ied, ranging from epilepsy to nervous system disease or injury. In dogs, hyper- thermia, poisoning, low blood sugar, nutritional deficiencies, distemper, intes- tinal parasites that have entered the bloodstream, tumors, low blood calcium after birthing, liver or kidney disease, and thyroid problems may be underlying fac- tors. In cats, convulsions may be linked to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), toxo- plasmosis, lymphosarcoma (leukemia), thiamine deficiency, or a heart disorder. All cases of seizures involve electrical disturbances of the brain that result in muscle contractions of variable intensity and loss of motor control. Many animals lose consciousness and bladder or bowel control during a seizure, and some may exhibit overly affectionate, frightened, or “clingy” behavior immediately before an epileptic episode. Digestive disorders, hair loss, neuralgia, and several other problems may also be associated with chronic convulsive disorders. Conventional therapies typically involve the use of phenobarbital, potassi- um bromide, or other anticonvulsant drugs. These measures can prove to be effective, but they cannot address the underlying causes of chronic convulsive disorders. HOLISTIC APPROACHES Holistic treatment usually entails a life- long effort, beginning with a dietary and environmental assessment and adjust- ment, and continuing with nutritional supplementation and herbal therapies that focus on normalizing and maintain- Skullcap is one of several herbs that can be used to treat epilepsy. Herbs for Pets 246 ing nervous system function. All possible environmental causes of or contributors to seizures should be removed from your home. Eliminate all possible contact with antifreeze fluids, household chemicals, pesticides and herbicides, lead-based paints, and other neurotoxins from your companion’s environment. (These sub- stances are harmful to humans, as well.) Animals with epilepsy or other convul- sive disorders should be on a natural, whole foods diet. Cats with epilepsy, however, should not be fed raw fish because it contains thiaminase, an enzyme that breaks down vitamin B1 (thi- amine). Vitamin B1 is essential for healthy nervous system functions. In all animals, dietary supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 EFAs is important in the development and maintenance of healthy nervous system structure and function. Animal Essentials makes an excellent EFA supplement for dogs and cats. In addition to EFAs, supplementing your companion’s diet with essential and nonessential vitamins, minerals, and digestive enzymes and with probiotics is indicated to assure that the nervous sys- tem is getting everything it needs to heal and function optimally. A daily supple- mentation of 100-300 milligrams of betaine HCl; 50-500 milligrams of dimethylglycine; 200-1000 milligrams of taurine; and 10-200 milligrams of proan- thocyanidin complex is said to be helpful for epileptic dogs. Recent studies have shown that a ketogenic diet can be effec- tive for treating severe epilepsy in humans, but at this point we can only speculate about the usefulness of this approach in animals. We have seen promising results with the use of skullcap in the treatment of epileptic animals. This nervine is believed to moderate overactive synaptic activity in the higher brain centers in which epileptic episodes may be triggered. We have received many good reports about valerian and oatstraw, too, especially when they are combined in equal pro- portions with skullcap. Although these herbs do not represent a cure for epilep- sy, their reported effects include less fre- quent and less severe episodes. Lemon balm, ginkgo, rosemary, hop, passion- flower, and perhaps kava kava (research is promising in the area of controlling seizures in rodents) may also be effective in the treatment of chronic seizures. Additionally, flower essences of vervain or chestnut bud may be helpful in moderat- ing seizures. FIRST AID FOR SEIZURES If your animal experiences a seizure, gen- tly protect his head from sharp or hard objects until the episode passes. Don’t attempt to restrain the animal’s body— the muscle contractions of a violent con- vulsion can be self-injurious if the animal cannot move and jerk about freely. Never place your hand in or near your animal’s mouth during a seizure—your compan- ion may be unaware of your presence and may unknowingly bite you with incredible force! If you are indoors during the episode, dimming the lights and speaking softly to your companion helps reduce the fear and confusion that some- times precedes and usually follows the episode. Rescue Remedy rubbed on the ears before, during, and after a seizure sometimes helps moderate the episode and calm the animal. Be sure to take a hearty dose yourself! Eye Problems Many eye problems are just subtle signs of chronic underlying diseases. You might think your animal is the “picture of perfect health,” but if he has runny eyes or the beginning of cataracts, these con- ditions indicate that there is an underly- ing imbalance. Many times herbs alone An Herbal Repertory for Animals 247 are not enough to correct that imbal- ance. A vet who is trained well in classic homeopathy can address the underlying disease and help the body heal itself. In some cases of simple infection or irritation, an herbal wash of saline solu- tion and raspberry leaf tea clears up the problem immediately. In other cases, eye problems mark the beginning of a life- long course of holistic therapy. CATARACTS Cataracts are white opacities that block the passage of light into the eyes. They are caused by loss of water or rearrange- ment of fibrous tissue in the eye lens. Formation of cataracts (known as senile cataracts) is a normal part of the aging process. They seldom result in blindness and usually cause little or no vision impairment in older animals, even if the pupils take on the blue-white hue that is characteristic of the condition. Cataracts sometimes involve leakage of lens pro- tein into the inner eye. When this hap- pens, an immune response is triggered and the animal suffers serious inflamma- tion of the eye. Providing a well-balanced natural diet throughout an animal’s life is the surest way to prevent the development of prob- lematic cataracts. In cats, cataracts have been linked with vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency, a problem that stems more from poor nutrient assimilation than it does from lack of vitamin B2 in the aver- age feline diet. Lactation is also believed to deplete the feline body of B2. Therefore, dietary supplementation of the digestive enzymes and probiotics necessary to metabolize B2 is an impor- tant part of cataract prevention—espe- cially in nursing cats. Other recommend- ed vitamin supplements include glu- tathione, vitamin C, CoQ10, proantho- cyanidin complex, vitamin E, and dimethylglycine. A SIMPLE ASTRINGENT EYEWASH Using a clean dropper bottle, com- bine the following: 1⁄2 tsp of cooled clear raspberry leaf or nettle tea * 1⁄2 tsp of Oregon grape or goldenseal tea * Add 1 oz of sterile saline (available in the eye care section of supermar- kets and pharmacies) Shake the mixture thoroughly—the finished solution should be tinted yellow. * Make sure that the tea is absolute- ly free of particles—you don’t want them in your animal’s eyes! If possible, hold the animal’s head to one side and use a dropper pipette to thoroughly rinse the eye laterally, from the nose outward, toward the animal’s cheek. The idea is to wash any irritating particles away from the animal’s eye. This process can be repeated two or three times daily until the condition improves. If the rinse causes further irritation, stop using it—your companion may be sensitive to the herb you are using. Other herbs to consider for use in eyewashes include calendu- la, chamomile, thyme, bee balm, chickweed, dandelion leaf, or rose petals. Regardless of which herbs you use, be extra careful in assuring that they are free of dust, pollen, or toxic residues (such as herbicides or car exhaust), as the eyes are extremely sensitive to such foreign substances. Herbs for Pets 248 Both conventional and herbal approach- es to treating cataracts are limited. Conventional treatment includes cataract surgery, a procedure that can be very effec- tive. While some herbalists claim that a small dab of eucalyptus honey applied to the inside of the lower eyelid each day for sever- al weeks can reduce the opacity of the eye lens, another approach involves the internal use of an ancient Chinese herbal formula called Hachimijiogan. Animal studies have shown that Hachimijiogan is capable of slowing the progression of cataracts, espe- cially if therapy commences during early stages of the disease. Bilberry, when used in conjunction with vitamin E supplements, has been shown to help stop progression of senile cataracts in humans. In this approach, a standardized (to 25 percent anthocyano- sides) bilberry extract is administered at a dose of 20-40 milligrams per 40 pounds of body weight, three times daily. According to veterinarian Susan G. Wynn, homeopathic preparation eye- drops made from the juice of Cineraria maritima can be effective for eliminating cataracts in animals. Wynn says to dilute the drops by half with artificial tears (ster- ile saline solution) because the juice stings when used full strength. When using this method, she sometimes sees cataracts disappear in two to three months. CONJUNCTIVITIS Conjunctivitis is a generic term that refers to inflammation of the mucous mem- branes and soft tissues surrounding the eye. The problem occurs when bacteria, fungi, or other foreign substances come in contact with these tissues and tearing fails to eliminate the irritating elements. Most cases are acute and are caused by dust, plant material, or other environ- mental irritants. In these cases, a simple saline eye rinse usually brings relief. An astringent eyewash using raspberry leaf or nettle tea combined with a tea of cer- tified organic goldenseal or Oregon grape root offers further assistance by An herbal wash may clear up a simple eye infection or irritation. Homeopathic eyedrops may eliminate cataracts. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 249 fighting infection and quickly reducing inflammation and soreness. GLAUCOMA Glaucoma involves abnormally high inner eye pressure. It can occur in most animals, but it is especially common in cats and in certain breeds of dogs. The disease is often secondary to other intraocular diseases such as inflammatory adhesions and tumors. Signs of glauco- ma may include swollen or reddened eyes, dilated fixed pupils, loss of vision, and corneal edema. Conventional approaches to glaucoma usually involve antiglaucoma drugs that help reduce intraocular pressure. In some cases, corti- costeroid therapies are used. Although glaucoma is difficult to treat with herbs, perhaps the greatest success comes from the reduction of intraocular pressure with herbs such as ginkgo and bilberry. Cannabis sativa (marijuana) can be effective, too, but, of course, its accessibility is severely limited by legal restrictions. Coleus forskohlii, an herb that’s used in ayurvedic medicine, contains forskolin, a substance that has been shown to signif- icantly reduce intraocular pressure in humans, monkeys, and rabbits. However, its safety and effectiveness in various other animals have yet to be determined. First Aid BE PREPARED! The old scout motto “Be Prepared” real- ly rings true if you’re out walking your dog and he is attacked by another dog, cuts himself on barbed wire, or sprains his paw while playing Frisbee. Having a first aid kit specially designed for your animal and knowing how to use it pro- vides insurance for the well-being of your companion. Taking a course from the Red Cross or a local vet, kennel, or shel- ter enables you to deal with everything from life-threatening emergencies to minor cuts and sprains. In addition to the basic first aid neces- sities (plenty of gauze dressings and IDEAS FOR A FIRST AID KIT Place some of the following items in a water-resistant carrying case: • Blankets, extra collars, leashes, muzzles, water bowls • Gauze, bandages, small flashlight, scissors, tweezers, swabs, Vetwrap™, hemostats, rectal ther- mometer (with case), ear scope, hydrogen peroxide (for use as an emetic in certain poisonings, as well as an antibacterial wound wash), activated charcoal powder (for poisonings); preserved, sterile saline solution (for washing out wounds and eyes and to wash minor burns) • Herbal salve, Rescue Remedy, cayenne pepper and yarrow mix (to stop bleeding), herbal tinc- tures such as Oregon grape and echinacea • A list of items in the kit and brief descriptions of how they are used First aid kits for animals are avail- able through many catalogs, and you can add your own items to per- sonalize the one you choose.

Regardless of how extensive your first aid kit or class- room training might be, everything you compile is functionally useless if you are unable to react properly in a crisis situa- tion. The most crucial aspects of emer- gency preparedness are proactive study and mental conditioning. An emergency situation is a poor time to read up on what to do or give. During a crisis, time is of the essence, especially if your com- panion is bleeding severely or having a difficult time breathing. When placed under the stress of an emotional, adrena- line-pumped situation (such as after you watch your cat get hit by a careless motorist), the human mind loses much of its ability to formulate an effective plan of action—the mind begins to race, the knees start to shake, dizziness sets in, and it’s difficult to think. Instead of thinking the situation through, the brain must react by instinct. If there is no plan imbedded deep in the mind’s subcon- scious, panic sets in and all control of the situation is lost to a rampant avalanche of emotion and confusion. Panic is our worst enemy in an emer- gency situation because the confusion it causes paralyzes our abilities to take effective actions. It’s best to prepare for stressful emergency situations before they occur. This is done by visualizing cri- sis situations so that the mind is better prepared to respond intuitively and effec- tively when a real emergency occurs. For instance, if you are an avid backcountry equestrian, spend some time each week with your eyes closed, imagining various emergency situations that could occur to you and your companion on your upcoming trail trips. Be creative but real- istic in your visualization of each unfortu- nate event—imagine the fall, your com- ECHINACEA AND OREGON GRAPE CLAY POULTICE Combine the following: 4 oz green or bentonite clay (powder)* 1⁄2 oz echinacea tincture (alcohol based) 1⁄2 oz Oregon grape tincture (alcohol based) *Be sure to use only supplement- grade clay (available at health food stores) Bentonite clay that is sold at hard- ware and feed stores often contains harmful bacteria and other impuri- ties. Alcohol-based tinctures (as opposed to glycerin-based) are preferable because they add astrin- gency to the formula and serve as preservatives in a poultice that is saved for future use. Thoroughly combine the three ingredients, adding just enough distilled water to make a thick paste. The poultice can then be applied to the affected areas and left on to dry, if possible. Leftover poultice can be put into an airtight container and stored in the refrigerator almost indefinitely. If it dries out, just add more water or tincture to soften it. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 251 panion’s pain and terror, your racing heart, and the initial surge of panic and doubt that starts to envelop you. Then imagine overcoming that surge and tak- ing control of your emotions to assess the situation. Imagine opening your first aid kit and systematically selecting the items your companion needs as you calm him down by softly petting him and assuring him that you are in charge of the situa- tion. Imagine yourself remedying the sit- uation and knowing that everything will be fine. When we worked in emergency serv- ices, we called this exercise “crisis rehearsal”—others call it “creative visual- ization.” To some of you, this may sound like a program for paranoia, but it is quite the opposite. Paranoia is born from fear and a conscious sense of being helpless and out of control. Crisis rehearsal builds confidence and subconsciously prepares the mind for unforeseeable events. Each time you practice this technique, your subconscious mind stores experiential memories from which to act in emergen- cies. In other words, you don’t need to think, worry, or be paranoid of unfore- seeable possibilities each time you take your companion on an adventure— instead, you have the elements of effec- tive crisis management stored beneath the enjoyment of your adventure, where instinct can retrieve and use them if the need arises. This is an extremely effective technique for preparing for the worst. It has saved our lives and the lives of others more than a few times. Crisis rehearsal can make the difference between life and death for you and your companion. BITES AND STINGS If your companion receives a bite or a sting, the first course of action is to try to identify what launched the attack. Of course, this is not always possible, but if you can learn about the nature of the bite or sting, you will be more effective at treating it. In most cases, the primary course of action is to minimize pain, swelling, and the possibility of infection with the use of astringent and antimicro- bial herbs. A poultice or infusion of plan- tain, sage, bee balm, mullein, calendula, or chamomile can be directly applied to the site of an insect bite or sting for these purposes. To make a poultice, simply mash a few fresh leaves of the herb with a small amount of water to make a crude pestolike paste. In the field, the herb can be crushed and chewed in your mouth, then applied as a paste to the wound. Oregon grape, goldenseal, myrrh, thyme, or echinacea tincture, oil infusion, or salve FIRST AID OIL FOR CONTUSIONS AND BLUNT TRAUMA INJURIES Combine equal parts of the follow- ing oil infusions*: Yarrow Comfrey Saint-John’s-wort *See “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1 for instructions on how to make an oil infusion. Apply this first aid oil immediately to blunt injuries where subdermal bleeding is evident. After a day or two when the bleeding has stopped and the healing process has begun, arnica oil can be applied sparingly to the injury site for up to three days (any longer might irritate the skin). This will help move congested fluids out of the injured area by opening up capillaries. Herbs for Pets 252 can be applied to the area if stronger antimicrobial agents are warranted. One or all of these herbal preparations are excellent choices for building a first aid kit. An infusion of rosemary can be used for a bite or sting to gently bathe and soothe the surrounding area. Adding 6–8 drops of tea tree oil diluted in 1 ounce of water is also good for direct application to bites and stings, but be careful with animals who have sensitive skin—the oil is strong. For severe welts and inflammation, strong astringents such as decoctions of uva ursi, rose bark, white oak bark, or juniper leaves can be liberally applied to affected areas. A clay poultice made with bentonite clay is also effective, especially when herbs such as echinacea and Oregon grape are added to support lym- phatic functions and inhibit infection. When applied to the site of a sting or bite, the clay pulls antigens away from the body to reduce swelling and help prevent capillary transport of venom into other areas. Bites from toxic spiders, such as the brown recluse or black widow, or ven- omous snakes should be immediately fol- lowed with large doses of vitamin C and echinacea to build the body’s immune defenses and increase lymphatic cleans- ing of involved tissues. Immediate administration of the appropriate home- opathic remedy is also highly advisable. In the case of a bee or wasp sting, the homeopathic remedies Apis and Ledum help relieve stinging and swelling. If there is an anaphylactic reaction, or if the airway is compromised in any way, get to a veterinarian immediately. If you already know that your companion is predis- posed to acute allergic reactions, you should be carrying a prescription injectable epinephrine and antihistamine kit (Anakit or Epipen) that helps to anti- dote your animal’s reaction to insect or reptile venoms. See your veterinarian about obtaining a kit. BRUISES, BUMPS, AND OTHER BLUNT TRAUMAS Contusions (bruises) are caused when blunt impact or crushing pressure causes tissue damage and bleeding beneath the skin. In humans, contusions are usually characterized by their purplish red color. Because animals have different skin pigments and hair, feathers, fur, or scales to hide such evidence of injury, contu- sions and other forms of traumatic, sub- dermal hematoma must be identified by other symptoms. Usually there is swelling and tenderness at the site of a contusion. The animal may favor or lick the injured body area. Close examination (beneath the animal’s coat) usually reveals discol- oration at the site. Since contusions are contained beneath the skin, the risk of infection is low (provided the animal is healthy to begin with). First aid usually begins with applying an ice pack to slow bleeding and assist the coagulation process. Contrary to what some herbalists may think, arnica oil or salve is sometimes contraindicated in the early treatment of contusions or subdermal hematoma. Arnica, a peripheral vasodilator that works rapidly, may actually increase bleeding at the site of injury. Instead of reaching for your handy first aid vial of arnica oil, reach for an oil infusion of yarrow. Yarrow is remarkable because it acts as a vasodilator when ingested but as a fast-acting vasoconstrictor and hemostatic agent when applied topically. This makes it very useful for reducing the severity of fresh contusions, especially when combined with an oil infusion of Saint-John’s-wort. Having a special affini- ty toward the repair of crushed nerve endings, Saint-John’s-wort helps to relieve pain and minimize the possibility An Herbal Repertory for Animals 253 of lasting nerve impairment. Comfrey oil, salve, and poultice are also excellent first aid devices for blunt trauma injuries because they gently assist with lymph cir- culation without contributing to internal bleeding, and they accelerate the regen- eration of damaged cell structures. BURNS AND SCALDS There are two important considerations to keep in mind when your companion suffers a burn. One is that until the site of the injury cools down, cellular damage can continue for several minutes after a burn first occurs. This is especially true if the burn was caused by steam or scald- ing fluid, which can penetrate tissues and carry injurious heat deep beneath the skin. Another consideration to keep in mind is that when the skin is damaged, its ability to resist infection is greatly impaired. To defend itself against invad- ing bacteria, the skin relies upon delicate cell membranes and thousands of tiny capillaries to carry lymph, blood, and var- ious antibodies throughout its structure. When a burn occurs, circulation is obstructed within the site of injury, and the deprived tissues are left vulnerable to infection. The first course in treating a burn is to cool it down. Ideally, the site of the burn should be liberally irrigated with cool sterile saline, which greatly reduces the continued destruction of cells. If sterile saline is not available, clean water (preferably distilled), snow, or ice can be generously applied—just keep in mind that the area you are irrigating is espe- cially susceptible to any infectious microbes that may be in the water (i.e., the cleaner it is, the better). Never apply a salve, oil, or ointment to a burn—these types of preparations can seal in heat and bacteria, making the situation worse. Don’t cover the burned area with a band- age either unless you will be able to keep the dressing continually soaked with cool, clean water. If the burn appears to be deep (sec- ond or third degree) or if it involves the mouth, nose, feet, or a large percentage of the animal’s body, get the animal to a veterinarian immediately—the situation might be serious. The second course of action (for minor burns) is to take continuing meas- ures to assure that the burn is kept clean. Irrigate the burn several times each day with sterile saline. Aloe juice can be directly applied to the burn after each irrigation to help fight infection, reduce pain, and speed the healing process. A cooled tea of chaparral, calendula, or gotu kola can be effective for these pur- poses as well, as might a poultice of fresh chickweed. Comfrey is useful too, but it should not be applied until you are absolutely sure that the risk of infection has passed. Comfrey heals wounds so fast that it can seal bacteria or fungi into the wound! A skin rinse of chamomile, peppermint, catnip, bee balm, or thyme may bring relief from pain. Lavender oil (8 drops diluted into each ounce of clean water) is also good for relieving the pain of burns and scalds. The homeopathic remedies Apis and Urtica spp. (nettle) are effective treat- ments for burns. We keep a bottle of diluted Urtica tincture in our kitchen for use on burns. It takes the sting away immediately and prevents blistering. It can also be given internally. To help the healing process from inside out, dietary supplements of vita- mins C and E are important, as are fatty acids. Gotu kola can be added to an ani- mal’s diet to help with skin regeneration, as can horsetail. FRACTURES Obviously, herbs cannot be expected to realign and set a broken bone, but a Herbs for Pets 254 variety of herbs are useful throughout the postclinical healing process. Horsetail, nettle, comfrey, and alfalfa all contain nutritional components that play impor- tant roles in the healing of bone tissue. Yarrow and ginkgo help by increasing blood circulation in impaired extremities. Licorice, yucca, devil’s claw, Saint-John’s- wort, and cayenne are all useful for reducing inflammation and pain. Valerian, skullcap, passionflower, or hop can be used to help a recovering animal rest and relax. HEATSTROKE, HYPERTHERMIA, AND HEAT EXHAUSTION Heatstroke or heat exhaustion can occur as a result of too much strenuous exer- cise or excessive exposure to heat. If heatstroke is not treated immediately the animal’s body temperature may rise to irreversible levels and brain damage, kidney failure, or death may quickly fol- low. Symptoms of heat illness include excessive panting or difficulty breath- ing, high body temperature (above 104° F for a dog or cat), lethargy or col- lapse, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea or vomit, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, reddened tongue or eye tissues, hot and flushed skin, and seizures or coma. Perhaps the most common cause of heat-related illness and death in dogs and cats occurs when they are left in cars on a warm or hot day. Don’t ever leave your companion in the car unless the weather is mild, there is ample shade to park under, the windows can be left rolled down, and the animal is left with plenty of drinking water. Even on days that don’t seem hot, the temperature in a well-ventilated vehicle can exceed 100° F in a matter of minutes. With the win- dows rolled up, the temperature can climb to 180° F (a steak cooks at 140° F)! Dogs and cats need to pant and get fresh air to cool themselves. If you find an ani- mal in a car that is closed up, try to con- tact the owner and offer to give a bowl of water to his or her companion who “looks thirsty.” If done in a nonthreaten- ing way, without offending the person, you could save an animal’s life. If the per- son insists on letting the animal suffer, call the local law enforcement agency. If your companion displays signs of heat-related illness, get to a cool area immediately, wet the animal with water, and if possible, take the animal’s rectal temperature. If the animal’s temperature seems abnormally high, get to a vet immediately. If you are carrying a home- opathic kit with you, you might try administering a dose of Glonoinum (30C) while en route. Rescue Remedy (a flower essence formula) might be helpful as well. Allow your animal to drink as much cool water as he needs. After the danger has passed and your companion appears to be recovering, you can begin replacing lost minerals ALL-PURPOSE FIRST AID OIL OR SALVE Saint-John’s-wort oil infusion Oregon Grape oil infusion Comfrey oil infusion 1 oz grated beeswax Combine equal amounts of the oil infusions. Add the grated beeswax to the combined oils. Gently heat the mixture over a low flame, stir- ring constantly until the beeswax has completely melted and com- bined with the oils. Remove from heat and pour into salve jars imme- diately—it thickens as it cools. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 255 and nutrients by feeding him herbs such as nettle or chickweed tea. MOTION SICKNESS Motion sickness is fairly common among dogs and cats, especially puppies and those who seldom take rides in cars. The causes of motion sickness are varied. The inner ears of puppies and other young animals continue to develop until the animals approach adolescence, which means that their equilibrium may be especially sensitive to motion. Another factor comes into play in animals who are frightened or become hyperactive during car rides. In these animals, extreme nerv- ousness may cause stomach upset, dizzi- ness, or hyperventilation, all of which can result in vomiting. In most cases, motion sickness becomes less of a problem as an animal matures or becomes accustomed to the feeling of hurtling through space in a “crate on wheels.” Have you ever thought about how an animal might perceive such an unnatural occurrence as a car ride? With this in mind, it’s important to help your companion to consider car rides to be fun as early in life as possible. Make a point to play with your companion at the destina- tions of her first couple dozen car trips to replace confusion and fear with anticipation of a good time. For many animals, this approach is effective. We dearly remember riding to our moun- tain cabin with our dog Mollie on week- ends. The winding highway and steep ravines often made her nervous and carsick, so each time we reached the most challenging part of the highway, we would begin saying to her, “Get your Frisbee! Get your stick! Do you want to go swimming? Find the cat (her beloved friend and playmate)!” After a few verses of this, her mind would be so focused on the playtime that would soon follow that she would forget about the frightening ride and car sick- ness wasn’t a problem. Eventually, her nervousness during car rides was com- pletely replaced by the thrill of another adventure. Of course, some animals may never get over motion sickness, and anything that might help is certainly appreciated, espe- cially if you’re sharing a subcompact sedan with a Newfoundland. Ginger, pep- permint, catnip, fennel, or dill might help relieve an upset stomach that might lead to vomiting. Ginkgo is known to improve blood circulation in the inner ear and may help with equilibrium problems. Valerian helps calm a hyperactive animal and also eases a nervous stomach. Skullcap, pas- sionflower, and oatstraw are all excellent nervine-sedatives that can help reduce nervous anxiety. Of course, before you try any of these (in combination or singular- ly), give Rescue Remedy (flower essences) a try. A few drops on your animal’s tongue just before you get into the car might make the difference between an unpleas- ant episode and a fun car ride. PENETRATING INJURIES (CUTS, SCRAPES, PUNCTURES) Penetrating injuries are part of life, espe- cially if you have an active outdoor ani- mal. Animals tolerate wounds much bet- ter than we humans do, and provided animals have healthy lymph and immune systems and no blood-clotting disorders, minor open injuries usually heal quickly and completely. The primary concern here is that the injury is kept clean and as well ventilated as cleanliness allows. From a holistic perspective, an animal licking his open wound is a natural part of the healing process. This is how ani- mals cleanse wounds, and, in fact, the saliva of dogs and cats contain antimicro- bial properties that help fight infection and speed healing. Herbs for Pets 256 At the onset of a penetrating injury, the first course of action is to make sure that the bleeding is in no way life threat- ening. If bleeding is profuse, nothing serves as a better hemostatic agent than a half-and-half mix of powdered cayenne and yarrow. When applied liberally and directly into a wound, these two herbs work amazingly well to stop hemorrhage and inhibit infection. After the powder is applied, gauze compresses can then be placed on top to assist the process and keep the injury clean. Treat for shock, and get your companion to a veterinari- an immediately. If the wound does not appear to be life threatening, allow it to flush and seal itself, and thoroughly clean the site with fresh water (use sterile saline if possible) or some hydrogen peroxide as soon as possible. Oregon grape, goldenseal, Saint-John’s-wort, thyme, sage, echi- nacea, or yarrow tea or liniment can be used to irrigate the wound each day to help prevent infection. Tea tree oil is effective too, but it must be diluted. Add 8 drops into 1 ounce of olive, almond, or apricot kernel oil. Calendula, comfrey, gotu kola, or aloe can be added to the daily regimen after risk of infection has passed to help speed the healing process and reduce scarring. Any or all of the herbs we just mentioned can be used in the form of a first aid salve that is applied between each daily cleansing. The salve is also useful for field treatment of minor wounds. POISONING A shocking number of companion ani- mals die each year of poisoning. Some cases involve cruel human intent, others an unfortunate discovery or accident. But most companion animal poisonings are the direct result of carelessness. Improperly stored or disposed of auto- motive antifreeze fluid represents one of the most frequent causes of accidental animal poisoning. Ethylene glycol, the compound found in antifreeze, has a sweet flavor that is appealing to dogs, cats, and other animals. It destroys the kidneys, and as little as 1 tablespoon can be fatal to a medium or large dog. Lead poisoning from old house paint, discarded batteries, spilled petroleum products, or industrial waste is also a common cause of companion animal poisoning. Pesticides, herbicides, and household cleaning chemicals are famil- iar toxins as well. The mechanisms by which poisons act against the body are as varied as their chemistries. Lead-based poisons cause brain damage, while pesticides, herbi- cides, and household chemicals may cause nervous system damage, liver and kidney damage, internal bleeding, hypoxic blood disorders, or even cancer. Certain plants may cause poisoning too, although animals are less likely to ingest them, and their effects are mostly limited to digestive upset, photosensitive reac- tions, rashes, and in a few cases, internal bleeding. Food poisoning is usually limit- ed to the digestive tract and is generally corrected by vomiting. The chemical structure of a poison and the way it behaves in the body dic- tates the manner in which an animal is treated. In some cases, vomiting is induced to expel the poison from the body as quickly as possible. But in other instances, such as ingestion of petroleum products or acids, vomiting may further compound the problem by allowing poi- son to enter the lungs or burn the esoph- agus on the way out. This makes a gen- eral approach to poisoning impossible and illustrates why it’s critically important to identify the source of poisoning as quickly as possible. To prepare for the unforeseeable, keep some activated charcoal on hand. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 257 This is fed to a poisoned animal under the direction of a veterinarian to help absorb many forms of poison as the ani- mal is rushed to the veterinary hospital. If a poisoning does happen, don’t waste time with home treatment—get your companion to a veterinarian imme- diately! If two or more humans are pres- ent, one should transport the animal, while the other(s) should confirm the identity of the suspected poison and relay that information to the waiting veterinarian. Although many types of herbs such as violet root, elderberry, and aloe can be used to induce vomiting in certain cases of poisoning, this action is not recom- mended unless you know the exact nature of the poison and the proper course of action. Guessing can be fatal. Therefore, herbs are best reserved to sup- port and help rejuvenate an animal’s body after the crisis has passed. To help repair the liver after a poison- ing, milk thistle is strongly indicated. If the liver is inflamed, licorice may be of bene- fit. Mild cholagogue, alterative, and diuretic herbs, such as dandelion (root and leaf), burdock, alfalfa, and red clover, assist the body in efforts to eliminate resid- ual toxins and their metabolic by-prod- ucts. Yellow dock is believed to help remove heavy metals from the body. Immunostimulant and antioxidant herbs such as echinacea and garlic give the immune system a needed boost, while adaptogens such as astragalus or Siberian ginseng can help improve the body’s overall responses to the added stress. If kidney damage is evident, marshmallow, corn silk, ginkgo, hawthorn, horsetail, and couch grass are all candidates for use. If you wish to learn more about poi- sonings or need help during an emer- gency, call the Animal Poison Control Center at 1-888-426-4435. A consulta- tion fee of $60 applies. SHOCK Shock occurs when the vascular system is unable to provide adequate blood supply to vital organs. Hemorrhagic shock is caused when blood pressure and volume are reduced as a result of internal or external bleeding. Cardiogenic shock occurs when heart disease or dysfunction causes a reduction of blood delivery to other organs. Septic shock is caused when bacteria invade the heart muscle, other organs, or the blood itself and cause enough injury to cells to interfere with their ability to utilize oxygen. All types of shock create a situation in which various body tissues are deprived of oxy- gen that would normally be provided by the blood. Shock is therefore a life-threat- ening situation that demands immediate and decisive first aid attention. Get to a vet! You must stop bleeding and take measures to increase blood volume immediately. If the animal’s breathing is labored, try to position his body in a way that appears to make breathing easier. If possible, try to keep the lower half of the animal’s body slightly higher than the heart and head—this helps to keep blood volume at the brain, heart, and lungs. While en route to the veterinarian, Rescue Remedy can be applied to the ears, paws, or lips of a conscious or unconscious animal. TTouch, acupres- sure, and homeopathic remedies (Aconite and Arnica) may also prove helpful. If you’ve been trained, be pre- pared to perform CPR in the event of car- diac arrest. After a shock crisis is over, cardiopul- monary function can be assisted with the use of cardiovascular tonics. Hawthorn and ginkgo can be fed to strengthen the heart and increase blood circulation throughout the body. Yarrow or cayenne can be used to increase blood circulation and oxygenation in the lungs. Nettle, spirulina, and alfalfa are good nutritives Herbs for Pets 258 for building healthy blood. Garlic feeds the blood and also has antioxidant, vas- cular tonic, and immunotonic qualities. TENDONITIS, SPRAINS, AND LIGAMENT INJURIES Injuries of fibrous tissues that connect muscle with bone can be extremely painful and slow to heal. Generally speak- ing, the sooner herbal therapy starts, the faster the animal’s recovery will be. Arnica oil, salve, or poultice should be applied immediately after the injury occurs—this begins the healing process by increasing capillary circulation and lymphatic infusion. However, Arnica should not be used on open wounds. If Arnica is not available, yarrow, cayenne, or Saint-John’s-wort may prove benefi- cial, as will a poultice compress of com- frey. Homeopathic Arnica, Ledum, Rhus toxicodendron, or Ruta (depending on symptoms) may be effective first aid treatments as well. To continue the healing process, the animal’s diet can be supplemented with vitamin C and glucosamine sulfate or chondroitin sulfate. These supplements play positive roles in the reconstruction of connective tissues. Feeding your com- panion animal horsetail and comfrey can also aid in the reconstructive process. To help minimize pain and inflammation, yucca, licorice, willow bark (but not for cats), devil’s claw, and boswellia are all choices to consider. Yarrow and ginkgo can be fed to maintain good blood circu- lation in the affected extremity. Immune System Care To recognize and treat immune system disorders effectively, it’s important to have a general understanding of what the immune system is and how it works. The immune system is composed of a complex assortment of various cells and molecules, all of which are joined in an interdependent effort to maintain a bal- anced state of health. Each and every organ, tissue, and cell of the body has an integral role in this effort—the liver and kidneys, for instance, are responsible for filtering toxins and waste from the blood, and the skin serves as a first line of defense against pathogenic microbes and other environmental threats. Working beneath or within the structures and functions of the various organs and tissues of the body is a sophisticated army of frontline defenders—the millions of special cells, molecules, and microbes we know specifically as the immune sys- tem. Each member of this elite army has a special function—some members serve as sentries and detectives with the sole purpose of seeking out and identifying harmful invaders or waste products, while others serve as responding attack- ers to kill and remove invading microbes and other foreign substances. Like any army, the immune system must quickly reach each battlefield, or site of infection, to be effective. To allow a rapid response, the blood and lymphat- ic system serve as the army’s transport and incursion system. The blood carries antibodies (specialized proteins that serve to detect and report any foreign presence to the army’s soldiers), lympho- cytes and monocytes (the first-response assault teams), and interleukins and vari- ous other cytokines (messenger mole- cules that provide communication between other elements of the army), as well as oxygen and nutrients that are necessary to feed tissues and wage a bat- tle wherever the immune army is need- ed. To clean up the aftermath of battle, the spleen filters the blood and serves as a fatal trap for foreign bodies that were not killed by the body’s warriors. The lymphatic system’s purpose is to cleanse and nourish cells and tissues and to carry the immune effort across barriers An Herbal Repertory for Animals 259 that cannot be effectively reached by the blood. Lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow, thymus (hence the “T” in killer T cells), and throughout the body in various mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. The lymph (a clear, viscous fluid) then carries these warriors via an intri- cate network of tiny vessels on an end- less journey in and out of the blood- stream and the body’s various tissues. As the lymphocytes seek and destroy for- eign invaders, the lymph picks up their dead bodies and other debris. The waste is then filtered out and surviving invaders are destroyed at lymph nodes that are strategically positioned throughout the body. Autoimmune disease or dysfunction occurs when one or more elements of the immune system becomes deficient, overwhelmed, or overactive. Holistic treatment of autoimmune diseases (such as lupus, arthritis, FIV, allergies, to name a few) centers on assisting the body in its innate ability to establish and maintain balance and preparedness within the immune system. The use of vaccines, antibiotics, and steroid drugs is contra- dictory to the holistic healing effort because these substances are antagonis- tic to the body’s natural defense mecha- nisms. Such measures work by suppress- ing, confusing, or bypassing natural immune functions, which amounts to an artificially induced state of autoimmune deficiency. Barring genetic predisposition, ani- mals who are consistently well nourished and properly cared for have strong immune systems throughout their long, healthy lives. On the other hand, animals who are subjected to immunosuppres- sive drug therapies eventually develop some form of immune dysfunction—per- haps arthritis, chronic seborrhea, aller- gies, or diminished resistance to certain strains of bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Whether or not to vaccinate your companion involves heated arguments among animal care professionals on both sides of the issue, as well as political, social, economic, and legal interests. At the root of all the confusion lies a press- ing question: Should well-informed ani- mal guardians be allowed to decide what is best for their beloved companion ani- mals? We, of course, believe that owners should have that right. Although we can- not advise anyone to break the law in areas where vaccinations are deemed mandatory, we are holistically opposed to vaccinating animals. HERBS FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT Many of the diseases and problems dis- cussed in this book are related to the immune system. A few diseases or syn- dromes are recognized as being directly related to immunity and might be con- sidered autoimmune diseases. When Stimulating the immune system with echinacea may be counter-productive to the healing process. Herbs for Pets 260 most herb users think of immune system support, immunostimulant standbys such as echinacea immediately come to mind. For many immune-related disor- ders, however, increased stimulation of immune system functions represents only a small part of a complete herbal therapy, and in some cases, stimulation of immune activities may actually be coun- terproductive in the healing effort. A good case in point is discoid lupus ery- thematosus (DLE), a disease that occurs primarily in dogs and less commonly in cats. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin (primarily that of the nose, lips, cheeks, and ears) that occurs as the result of a failure in the regulating mechanisms of the immune system, specifically those that prevent the body from attacking its own cells. In other words, the immune army works against the body it is sup- posed to protect. Animals with DLE typi- cally suffer from pyoderma, seborrhea, and other chronic conditions of the skin, as well as arthritis, kidney problems, and other immune-mediated forms of dis- ease. For obvious reasons, it would be inadvisable to further stimulate the immune system with herbs such as echi- nacea. On the other hand, many herbs can act as immune moderators, meaning that they help adjust the immune system into balance. Such herbs include astra- galus, shiitake and reishi mushrooms, garlic, and ginseng. The immune system and its variable problems are complex, and no single herb serves as a panacea for immune sys- tem dysfunction. Because a great deal of sensationalism has been placed on herbs that have been shown to stimulate immune system functions, many people have been led to believe that an herb such as echinacea is always the first thing to reach for to fight any problem that involves the immune system. Entre- preneurs have made such claims a multi- million dollar affair, but the claims simply aren’t true. Contrary to what many herb product manufacturers might lead you to believe, immune system support does not begin with stimulation. In fact, stimulation should be limited to activating a healthy immune system in times when increased immune response is necessary to repel viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. In some cases of immune-mediated disease, immunostimulants may ultimately do more harm than good. For instance, echinacea and Saint-John’s-wort are capable of stimulating reproduction of killer T cells, the search-and-destroy sol- diers whose numbers are severely dimin- ished in people or animals with AIDS. On the surface of the problem, stimulation of T cells may sound like a good idea, but by stimulating their reproduction, we may also be aggravating and accelerat- ing the mechanisms that are causing their destruction. Therefore, the best course of action in immune-mediated problems is to support the body in its efforts to reestablish and maintain healthy balance among all aspects of nat- ural immunity. If stimulating the immune system is indicated, several herbs are available that have immunostimulant qualities. Some herbs, such as echinacea, have strong and specific immune-stimulating activi- ties, making them especially useful when the immune system needs a quick boost. Others, such as garlic, Siberian ginseng, astragalus, licorice, shiitake and reishi mushrooms, and turmeric, offer im- mune-supportive qualities in addition to a wide spectrum of tonic activities. For instance, astragalus, shiitake and reishi mushrooms, and Siberian ginseng are all adaptogens, meaning that they help increase energy levels and improve the body’s ability to respond to stressful situ- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 261 ations (such as systemic disease, infec- tion, or emotional trauma). Garlic offers strong antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hypotensive activities in addition to being an immunostimulant device. Turmeric stimulates liver and digestive functions as part of its immune-boosting agenda. Licorice and borage stimulate the adrenal glands and support and pro- tect the liver, making them useful in treating Addison’s disease (hypoadreno- corticism) or problems that stem from steroid drug use or excessive X-ray exposure. In summary, before you pick up echi- nacea for immune system support, edu- cate yourself. Find out more about your companion animal’s condition and read up on echinacea and other herbs men- tioned in this book as well as other immune-supportive herbs. You will likely find an herb that is specifically suited to your companion’s needs. ALLERGIES Allergies occur when antigenic sub- stances (allergens) enter the body and trigger a disproportionately aggressive immune response. Conventional treat- ment usually involves the use of antihista- mine and corticosteroid drugs. These drugs suppress immune system functions so that the uncomfortable symptoms of allergy cannot occur. This action allevi- ates the symptoms for a while but leaves their actual causes unaddressed. In fact, such drugs may compound the underly- ing immune system dysfunction that is causing the problem in the first place. Allergies are a symptom of an immune system disorder that may be related to a nutritional deficiency or excess, steroid or antibiotic therapies, vaccinosis, or metabolic dysfunction. Therefore, the questions to ask in the holistic treatment of allergies are three- fold: (1) What substance is causing an immune response, (2) Why is the immune system responding so dispro- portionately to the substance, and (3) What can be done to help correct this response? Holistic treatment is focused on mod- erating immune responses and improv- ing the body’s ability to process and elim- inate potential allergens. The effort begins with an intensive assessment of the animal’s diet, environment, and health care history. As causative factors are identified and dealt with, herbal ther- apy begins with tonic support of liver, digestive, lymphatic, and urinary func- tions that are responsible for filtering and eliminating problematic substances from the body. This in turn supports and improves immune activities by helping to remove antigenic substances and meta- bolic waste products that might be com- pounding the problem. At the core of this approach are alterative, diuretic, and cholagogue herbs. Burdock, red clover, dandelion root, spirulina, and alfalfa are all worthy candidates for improving liver efficiency and building strong, healthy blood. The oils or stabilized powders of flaxseed, borage seed, black currant seed, and evening primrose seed contain EFAs that play important roles in immune system development and health. Dandelion leaf serves especially well as an effective diuretic agent to aid in the elimination of waste products that are carried out of the body via the urine. Nettle is an excellent tonic for animals who suffer from seasonal allergies, as it lends mild antihistamine relief in addi- tion to strong diuretic and blood-nour- ishing qualities. The Basic Support Formula under “Skin Problems” is useful for all of these purposes. Uncomfortable symptoms of allergy can be approached according to the sys- tems involved. In severe cases in which identification of causative factors proves Herbs for Pets 262 to be a lengthy process, licorice can be used as a less-obtrusive alternative to steroid drugs. The Systemic Detoxifying Formula under “Skin Problems” may be effective. It’s important to remember, however, that symptomatic suppression does not amount to a cure. Don’t be fooled into action by the joy of seeing your companion feel better—keep look- ing for answers until a long-term holistic solution is found. Because an allergy equates to an over- active immune system, immunostimulant herbs (such as echinacea) may be con- traindicated. Adaptogenic herbs, those herbs that improve or support the body’s response to stressful circumstances such as Siberian ginseng or astragalus may be helpful in re-establishing and maintain- ing immune system balances in animals who suffer allergies. Mouth and Nose Problems MOUTH PROBLEMS Some animals have problems with their teeth and gums throughout their lives. Others seem to be lucky or in such good health that their gums and teeth remain healthy for life. A healthy, natural, raw food diet is paramount to healthy gums and teeth. For dogs and cats, this means raw, meaty bones and a diversity of enzyme- and nutrient-rich fresh vegeta- bles. Many herbivores have needs that go beyond simple dietary cleansing and nutrition—their teeth need to be contin- uously worn down by the foods they eat to prevent the teeth from becoming too long and to remove weak and decaying outer layers of enamel. Fresh, whole, fibrous vegetables and grains are an absolute necessity for this process. Most mouth problems are easily taken care of at home with a few simple herbal preparations. But if your animal is having difficulty chewing and eating or is paw- ing at his mouth, he may have a minor tooth or gum infection that can progress into a serious condition if not addressed. In cases of gingivitis, bacteria can eventu- ANTIMICROBIAL NOSE DROPS Calendula tincture * Oregon grape tincture * Usnea lichen tincture * 2 oz sterile saline Combine 10 drops of each of the alcohol tinctures with the sterile saline. *Tinctures are available through most herb retailers To use for sinusitis, drop or spray the above solution into each nostril, preferably with the animal’s head tilted slightly skyward. Expect resist- ance and sneezing during adminis- tration—your companion probably won’t like this. Adverse reactions are rare with this formula, but before administering a full dose, check for hypersensitivity by placing a small drop onto the rim of one nostril. If your companion starts sneezing and doesn’t stop within a few minutes, he may be sensitive to one or more of these herbs or the alcohol, so don’t use the drops. A drop or two per nostril twice daily is a sufficient dose for cats and similar-sized animals. Dogs need 4–6 drops per nostril (or a short squirt of the sprayer). Horses and other large animals require 10–20 drops per nostril. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 263 ally infect the kidneys, causing irre- versible damage to these vital organs. If your herbal efforts fail to remedy your companion’s bad breath or oral discom- fort or if the animal’s gums are severely inflamed, bleeding, or discharging pus, get to a veterinarian immediately. A red gum line (along the base of an animal’s teeth) may also be indicative of a serious underlying problem that demands pro- fessional attention. Gingivitis and Infections of the Mouth Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums that is usually caused by bacterial infec- tion. Symptoms may include bad breath; reddened, swollen, and sometimes ulcer- ated gums; and pain and difficulty while eating. Gingivitis rarely occurs in healthy animals who receive a balanced, raw food diet. It’s therefore important to make sure your companion receives the vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and probi- otics he needs to maintain a strong immune system and good oral health. For dogs and cats, nothing compares with raw, meaty bones for maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Other causes of oral infection include puncture wounds from fights or ram- bunctious play (puppy and kitten teeth make for dangerous jaw wrestling), abra- sions or lacerations from chewing on nonfood items, wood splinters, and den- tal cavities. Dietary supplementation of CoQ10, vitamin C, and a variety of antimicrobial herbs may prove useful for reducing infection and activating the healing process in the mouth. Echinacea provides a needed boost to the immune system. To inhibit bacteria or fungi directly, a tincture of certified organic goldenseal, Oregon grape, thyme, sage, rosemary, or better yet, myrrh, can be liberally applied directly to the animal’s gums (or any other site of oral infection) with a cotton swab. If the animal is less than coopera- tive, a turkey-basting syringe can be used to rinse the animal’s mouth—put 20 drops of tincture in 2 ounces of water or give 2 ounces of tea for each 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, two to three times daily. To freshen bad breath, pars- ley leaf can be fed as a tincture, as a cooled tea, or in its whole form. If bad breath is not a problem, dietary supple- mentation of garlic can also be helpful. Propolis is also excellent for infected gums or mouth ulcers. NOSE AND SINUS PROBLEMS Nose and sinus problems are usually due to environmental influences such as bites, stings, allergens, microbial infec- tion, or litter box dust (a major cause of sinus problems in cats). Provided the problem is isolated to the nose and nasal passages and is related to foreign sub- stances, not a tumor or other metabolic disorder, nose and sinus problems can be treated effectively with simple herbal preparations. If the problem is secondary to other disorders, the therapeutic approach varies according to the nature of onset. For instance, sinusitis secondary to seasonal allergies is best approached with dietary adjustment and herbs that Swab antimicrobial herbal tinctures directly on your dog’s gums to treat oral infections. Herbs for Pets 264 support the various systems involved. Inflammation secondary to an insect sting requires topical (astringent) appli- cations to help relieve uncomfortable symptoms and immunotonic and lym- phatic herbs such as echinacea and cal- endula to support the metabolic process- es of removing foreign substances from involved tissues. Sometimes, abnormal nasal dis- charge, inflammation, sneezing, or other symptoms may be difficult to link to a cause. In these cases, the diagnostic capabilities and holistic insights of an experienced veterinarian should not be overlooked. If a problem is found to stem from deeper health issues, holistic treatment must begin at those issues and not with the nasal symptoms. This is important: Don’t assume anything. Identify the cause of disease before beginning any herbal treatment. If you don’t, you may be neglecting your com- panion’s real needs. For bacterial or fungal infections of the nostrils, sinuses, or outer tissues of the nose, a saline-based preparation of calendula, Oregon grape, and usnea lichen can be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi. Externally, this preparation can be liberal- ly applied to all affected areas. For infec- tions inside the nose and sinuses, it can be administered with a dropper or as a nasal spray (empty bottles for nasal spray are available from pharmacies). Parasite-Related Problems: How to Live with Fleas,Worms, Mites, and Other Things That Suck If you’re like most people who share their homes with companion animals, there’s a good chance that this is the first part of the book you’ve turned to. Parasites are the most common source of torment and frustration shared by animals and their human guardians. From an animal’s per- spective, fleas, mites, and other blood- sucking freeloaders are often the causes of sustained torture and misery. To an animal guardian, parasites are evil, dis- gusting, and invasive. Creatures that latch onto flesh and suck the life fluids from their hosts have earned top billing in our nightmares. Unfortunately, while we struggle with our hate for such creatures by engaging in a relentless and futile battle to wipe parasites from the face of the planet, we often overlook the deeper reasons they cause so much misery to our animals. After all, tapeworms, fleas, ticks, mites, and other sucking insects have coexisted with animals for millions of years, which implies that there must be natural provi- sions to allow for a more harmonious coexistence. How did animals cope before humanity developed poisons and vaccines to reduce parasite populations? Did all animals suffer from chronic prob- lems such as flea allergies, digestive dys- function, or heart disease because they were infested with too many parasites? Of course not. Then why do some ani- mals nowadays live their entire lives virtu- ally undisturbed by parasites, while oth- ers with the same level of exposure are constantly tormented by them? To find the answers to such questions, we need to step away from our antiparasitic obsessions long enough to consider the life of a parasite. HOLISTIC APPROACHES Parasites, as repulsive as the fact may be, exist inside and on top of every living thing on earth. They even live on each other. In fact, a body (human or other- wise) is home for a teeming biocom- munity of millions of interdependent life-forms, many of which happen to be parasites. From a holistic perspective, An Herbal Repertory for Animals 265 parasite-related health problems ema- nate not from the mere presence of these vampires but from the host’s inability to deal with them effectively. Some animals may test positive for Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) but never suffer ill health. On the other hand, some animals who appear to be healthy cannot tolerate a single fleabite without getting sick. Parasites are opportunity seekers that exploit the weaknesses of their host. Their goal in doing so is to reproduce and take control of their environment. If the host is malnourished and poorly equipped to keep parasite populations in check, the parasites will take advantage of the body’s inadequate defenses and begin reproducing, eating, and creating waste faster than the body can clean and replenish itself. If the immune system is dysfunctional and responds too aggres- sively to the parasites, an “allergic response” occurs. The most effective and holistic approach to parasite infection is to keep your animal well nourished and healthy. An animal with a strong, properly func- tioning immune system presents an inhospitable living environment for par- asites and is less likely to suffer from par- asite-related allergies. But there’s still an important question to be asked before the holistic picture is complete: What happens to this scenario when we give in to our hatred and fear of parasites and opt to use preventive drug meas- ures in our pets? Any answer to this question is likely to raise controversy. Antiparasitic drugs represent a multibil- lion-dollar industry in the U.S., and many veterinarians support manufactur- ers’ claims that modern dewormers, skin-absorbed flea control agents, and other internal measures are effective and generally safe. On the other side of the issue, though, holistic practitioners and naturally oriented animal guardians are concerned about the serious long- term effects associated with such drugs. Of course, we’re among those on this side of the issue, and here’s why. To start with, anything that can poi- son a parasite cannot be good for the host. From a holistic standpoint, any- thing that bypasses or interferes with nat- ural body functions is likely to create its own state of imbalance in the body. For instance, chemical wormers (aside from being potentially toxic to animals) are not 100 percent selective in what they kill, meaning that beneficial microbes, such as those that play important roles in digestion and nutrient absorption, might be compromised. In addition to this pos- sibility, most antiparasitic agents come with their own long lists of potential side effects, including seizures, liver failure, or even death. Ivermectin, a drug common- ly used to treat and prevent heartworm infection, may not only cause central nervous system depression but also act as an immunosuppressant. That is, while it works to kill heartworms it also makes the body more vulnerable to countless other diseases. The holistic herbalist does not see par- asites as a cause of disease but as symp- toms of a deeper imbalance. Parasites themselves are viewed as what they real- ly are—tough, adaptable, ancient life- forms that will likely inhabit the earth long after humankind is gone. They are part of nature. Therefore, effective natu- ral solutions to parasite-related disorders are not found through fervent and dan- gerous attempts to destroy them but from learning to coexist with them. In our minds (and remember, we’re herbalists, not veterinarians), stopping a symptom with chemicals that can harm the patient does not constitute preven- tive or curative medicine—it only repre- sents a dangerous, short-term interven- tion that may actually compound the ani- Herbs for Pets 266 mal’s health problems. Indeed, some forms of parasitic infection can be serious, even life threatening. The benefits of antiparasitic drugs are their convenience and their effectiveness at bringing symp- tomatic relief to an animal who is already suffering. But what are the potential costs to the animal? To find answers, check the back label or product information sheet for a list of side effects of the next antipar- asitic drug you consider for your compan- ion. Regardless of the danger issues, you owe your animal the opportunity to stay healthy and naturally free from parasite- related problems. This, of course, is what holistic animal care is all about. NUTRITION AND OTHER PREVENTION CONSIDERATIONS As we’ve stated before, the most effec- tive treatment and prevention for all problems related to parasites is to make sure your companion gets the nutrition he needs. Without a complete natural diet, your animal’s resistance and ability to adjust to parasites is greatly dimin- ished. Equally important is the need to identify and correct any element of diet, environment, or activity that may be causing added stress on one or more body systems. If, for instance, your dog has an allergy to the wheat he receives in his daily meals, his immune system will already be compromised when new parasites enter his body. Likewise, if he has undergone long-term drug thera- pies, his immune system may be in a depressed state and his defenses may be low. Remember that parasites are opportunity seekers. Digestive enzymes and probiotic bac- teria supplements can be of help in main- taining a healthy balance between potentially harmful “digestive bugs,” and those that lead the preventive fights for good health. A full array of vitamins and minerals is necessary to keep the blood healthy and the immune system operat- ing at its peak potential. Omega-3 and omega-6 EFAs, along with the proper balance of antioxidant vitamins (especial- ly C, A, and E) and minerals, are neces- sary for healthy, resilient skin that offers less opportunity for enterprising mites, fleas, and parasitic fungi. In addition to vitamin C’s roles as an essential nutrient and antioxidant, it has been shown to lend allergy relief through the antihista- mine qualities it possesses. Exercise is also important, as is a clean environment. The harder you work at helping your animal stay healthy, the less time and money you’ll spend on treating parasite-related problems after the fact. As is the case in all forms of medicine, prevention truly is the cure. FLEAS Animals who are hypersensitive to fleas may suffer a severe reaction from a single bite—so severe that they pull their hair out and chew bloody patches from their skin. Conventional approaches to flea-contact dermatitis typically start with medicated shampoos, flea control devices, and corti- coid ointments and then lead to internal corticosteroid drug therapies if conditions worsen. Anyone who has watched a com- panion suffer from a flea allergy knows how easy it is to look past the dangers of prednisolone. The problem is, pred- nisolone and other corticosteroid drugs don’t just suppress uncomfortable symp- toms but they also suppress the immune system. Add to this the possible long- term side effects of water retention, hypertension, liver damage, thyroid dysfunction, obesity, and heart attack, and suddenly the corticosteroid option doesn’t sound so kind. To approach the flea dilemma from a holistic standpoint means to embrace a perspective that includes the animal as a whole body in crisis. We must ask our- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 267 selves why fleas are bothering our ani- mals in the first place rather than focus solely on their elimination. Effective flea control starts inside your pet and in his living environment. Holistic therapy does not begin with shampoos, coat dips, rins- es, or sprays; it begins by strengthening the host and by making your animal’s liv- ing quarters less hospitable to fleas. It’s important to remember that flea prob- lems are always secondary to something else, and it’s that “something else” that makes your companion an attractive “bed and breakfast” for fleas. Healthy animals with healthy coats and properly functioning immune defenses generally don’t have many fleas. And even if healthy animals do pick up a few fleas, their systems are able to handle the bites without the excessive histamine respons- es that cause all of the itching. To help your healthy animal deal with parasites comfortably, feed him small amounts of garlic as a supplement to a proper diet. Contrary to what many believe, though, garlic should not be fed in quantities that cause that garlic odor to exude from the animal’s skin. This is not only a waste of garlic but potentially harmful to your animal. Dietary supplementation with brew- er’s yeast and vitamin B complex have been popular for years as antiflea meas- ures, the theory being that these supple- ments adjust body chemistry in a way that makes the animal less appealing to fleas. The effectiveness of such measures is questionable, and many animals are allergic to brewer’s yeast (especially if it is low grade), but nevertheless, these sup- plements are worth a try. If your animal has an autoimmune defi- ciency, immunostimulants such as echi- nacea, Saint-John’s-wort, or astragalus may be of help. However, immunostimulants should be used with caution or may be contraindicated in animals with severe allergies or other diseases that are associat- ed with an overactive immune system or with immune functions that are working against the body (such as lupus and FIV). In addition to garlic, alterative herbs such as burdock root, dandelion, and red clover serve as useful dietary adjuncts by helping the body eliminate waste and allowing natural defense systems to work more freely in coping with fleabites. Nettle may be sprinkled onto your ani- mal’s food to lend nutritive support and a mild antihistamine action that may reduce the severity of an allergic response. Giving 1⁄2–1 teaspoon of the dried herb for each pound of food fed is a good starting dosage range. If your ani- mal won’t eat dried nettle, you can steep it in hot water or salt-free meat broth, which you can then add to your compan- ion’s food. Oxeye daisy (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), a common waste-area weed, is also said to have mild antihista- mine qualities that don’t really block Nettle (dried or steeped in hot water or broth) can reduce an animal’s allergic response to fleas. Herbs for Pets 268 histamine but may help slow its release. If fleabite allergies are severe, itching is persistent, and the skin is red and inflamed, licorice can be used as an inter- nal anti-inflammatory remedy. Externally, fleas and their effects can be addressed several ways. The animals’ living environment can be sprinkled with diatomaceous earth, the sandlike remains of ancient marine organisms. Its activity against parasites is strictly mechanical, as each tiny particle has sharp points and edges that penetrate the bodies of fleas to cause their miserable deaths. Because of its gritty, penetrating nature, diatoma- ceous earth should not be applied to dry, irritated, hypersensitive skin, and it should never be allowed to contact eyes or other mucous membranes. Care also needs to be taken when spreading the substance onto carpets since walking around can stir up the dust and may cause silicosis, a form of pneumonia relat- ed to breathing the dust of silica and other sands. Otherwise it’s generally quite safe. In fact, it’s approved by the FDA for both internal and external use in livestock animals and has been used safe- ly in the natural care of companion ani- mals for years. Some pet owners may have heard that borax products are good flea exter- minators, but borates can be quite toxic and may cause death if misused, accord- ing to Dr. Michael W. Dryden of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). One of the manufacturers of borax states that borax is not intended for application to carpet and upholstery. Frequent vacuuming, washing your animal’s bedding, and regularly steam- cleaning your carpet also helps reduce flea populations in the environment. Some products made with nematodes are available to “infect” and kill fleas where they live in your house and in the lawns around the house. All of these measures are available through natural pet-product retailers. To help eliminate fleas from your ani- mal’s coat and to soothe and heal his itchy skin, several herbs come to mind. Flowers of feverfew, pyrethrum daisy, or oxeye daisy (or just about any other flower from the Chrysanthemum genus) contain com- pounds known as pyrethrins. Pyrethrins are well known to have paralytic activities in fleas. In fact, pyrethrins and their syn- thesized derivatives are common in many brands of flea spray. In their natural form, pyrethrins are safe and can be quite effec- tive. Pyrethrins used in the form of a crude herbal preparation, however, won’t always kill fleas but may only paralyze them temporarily. This means you should take additional measures to assure that fleas are out of your life forever. Making a pyrethrin flea rinse is as sim- ple as plucking a few handfuls of feverfew flowers, putting them into a cup, and steeping them in enough hot water to cover them. Briskly stir the mixture every couple of minutes until the mixture is cool enough to pour over your pet. You can strain the tea away from the flowers HERBAL FLEA REPELLENT POWDER Combine the following dry ingre- dients: 1 part diatomaceous earth 2 parts feverfew flowers 2 parts mullein flowers 2 parts yarrow flowers, leaves, and stems 1 part sage or thyme Sprinkle and brush into your animal’s coat daily An Herbal Repertory for Animals 269 or just pour the entire mixture over your pet, but use the rinse right away—the active compounds break down and lose potency shortly after the tea is made. Be sure to soak the animal all the way down to the skin, and allow the rinse to air dry on your companion until the fur is damp but not dripping. Then, at a location that is as far away from the house as possible (remember, many of the fleas will recov- er with a hunger), rinse the animal with a strong stream of water while combing his coat, and look for paralyzed vampires. Other flea-killing plant compounds include rotenone and limonene. Rotenone is readily available in the flowers of mullein (Verbascum thapsus), an Asian weed that occurs in waste areas throughout most of North America and Europe. The flowering tops are best if used fresh in the form of a strong decoction, but the dried blossoms (available through herb retailers) can be used too, again in the form of a cooled tea. When using mullein flowers or any other form of rotenone, be sure to keep the herb away from fish tanks or any amphibians— although it’s safe for mammals, it is quite toxic to aquatic life forms. Limonene is a volatile oil found in citrus and many of the culinary herbs belonging to the parsley (Umbelliferae) family. A good source of limonene is contained in celery seeds (up to 60 percent limonene). For the best results, harvest the seeds while they are green and juicy, and make a tea rinse immediately. Good-quality dried seeds can be used as a second source. Other limonene-bearing “umbels” include dill (leaf and seed) and fennel (seed). Another herb that has been regaining popularity in recent years as an antiflea device is Canadian fleabane (Conyza canadensis). Until recently, Canadian flea- bane (also called horseweed) was known by herbalists primarily as a urinary astrin- gent. Its common name has caught the attention of several natural pet-product manufacturers, who claim that it is one of nature’s greatest allies against fleas. Current research has concluded that Canadian fleabane contains flea-killing limonene as well. A much stronger source of limonene is essential oil of bit- ter orange, available through most stores that carry aromatherapy oils. This essen- tial oil is very concentrated—just 6–10 drops diluted into 8 ounces of water is said to be an effective rinse against fleas. Simply moisten the animal’s skin and coat with the mixture daily. GARLIC AND MULLEIN EAR OIL Combine the following: 1 part garlic oil 1 part mullein oil 10–20 drops of vitamin E oil for each 1 oz of the garlic and mullein oil mixture For instructions on how to make an herb oil, turn to the “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1. Apply oxeye daisy flowers as a flea rinse. Herbs for Pets 270 To help relieve itching and promote healing, a calendula rinse is a good choice, as is aloe juice, which can be diluted with 4 parts water (e.g., 1 cup of aloe juice to 4 cups of water). Peppermint or lavender may help bring relief as well. If scratching has left oozing, infected scabs, yarrow, rosemary, or thyme can be generously added to the rinse. One advantage of using yarrow is that it adds its own insect-repellent qual- ities to the effort. If inflammation is severe and scratching has lead to hair loss, an astringent skin rinse may be indi- cated. Also, many good herbal flea and coat shampoos are on the market. These can be useful for bringing soothing relief. Don’t shampoo your animal too often, though, or you might dry out the skin and cause added irritation. When using shampoos, also remember that their overuse can result in microbial imbal- ances on the surface of the body. Your animal’s skin supports a natural commu- nity of interdependent organisms, many of which serve antiparasitic or cleansing purposes. To let them do their jobs it’s probably best not to shampoo your ani- mal more than once or twice a week dur- ing a crisis. By now you might be wondering why we haven’t mentioned North American pennyroyal (Hedeoma pulegioides). Well, we won’t argue about the effectiveness of pennyroyal at deterring fleas. In fact, it’s one of the best antiflea herbs around, which is why it is included in dozens of commercial flea preparations. The prob- lem with it is that the volatile oils (com- posed mostly of an oil called pulegone) contained in pennyroyal can be toxic to animals, with the list of potential side effects beginning with nausea, vomiting, and abortifacient properties and ending with elevated blood pressure and possi- ble kidney and liver damage. While most flea dips, sprays, and powders that con- tain pennyroyal include relatively dilute concentrations of the volatile oil, a cumu- lative risk may exist to animals who lick off these topical preparations. Cats can be very sensitive to pennyroyal, and those with preexisting kidney disease (a widespread, chronic problem in cats) might even die from it. In our minds, such risks are unnecessary in the pres- ence of safer, more holistic flea control measures. One such measure is the Triple-Punch Herbal Flea Rinse. Herbal flea powders usually aren’t as effective as rinses, but they are handy for animals and people on the go. The key to success in making a powder is to be sure that all of the herbal ingredients are as fresh as possible. Pyrethrin-bearing plants lose much of their potency after they are dried, and aromatic herbs such as laven- der or yarrow lose their flea-repellent pungency eventually. The best you can TRIPLE-PUNCH HERBAL FLEA RINSE 1 part feverfew flowers 1 part mullein flowers (keep away from aquatic animals!) 1 part yarrow flowers, leaves, and stems 1 part celery seeds (freshly ground) 3 parts calendula flowers Make a tea rinse of the herbs by cov- ering the mixture with boiling water and allowing it to stand until cooled. To add even more “punch” to the formula, 6–10 drops of Bitter Orange essential oil can be added to each 8 ounces of rinse. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 271 hope for with a homemade flea powder is “flea discouragement.” It’s unlikely that you will succeed in eliminating or repelling every biting flea without taking other measures as well. To keep your flea powder as fresh and active as possible, make it in small, frequent batches. An electric coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle can be used to grind your herbs into powder. MITES Mites are an excellent example of just how common parasites are. These tiny, often microscopic, arachnids are every- where and on everything. A healthy human body carries millions of them. In fact, all living land animals carry mites— even fleas and mites have mites! When you’re finished scratching, it’s important to know that relatively few of the parasitic varieties of mites cause problems. Those that do cause problems burrow under the top layers of the skin to cause hair loss, skin disfigurement, and painful lesions on the skin and in the ears. In dogs, cats, horses, and other mam- mals, various species of skin mites are commonly referred to as mange. In instances of human infection, we usually refer to them as scabies. Various species of mange are differenti- ated by the specific nature of the infec- tions they cause. Sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) is the most contagious (some species can be transmitted to humans) and often the most severe form of mange, characterized most frequently by crusty, reddish brown lesions that usu- ally appear first on the head and neck, between the legs, or in the “armpits” of the victim animal. Demodectic mange, or red mange (genus Demodex), is a far less contagious mite that infects hair follicles, often causing hair loss and a foul-smelling bacterial infection of the skin. Both chori- optic mange (genus Chorioptis) and psoroptic mange (genus Psoroptes) are common in cattle, horses, sheep, and goats and produce similar symptoms. Otitis externa, or otodectic ear mange, occurs in dogs and cats and is character- ized by inflammation and brown, waxy discharge from the ears. Rabbits are sus- ceptible to ear mange as well. Occurrence of ear mites in horses and other large ani- mals is relatively uncommon. All of the mange-causing mites have one thing in common: they are all oppor- tunity-seeking parasites that prefer a defenseless host. Therefore, prevention in the form of a well-balanced natural diet that provides immune system support should begin before an infection occurs. Fortunately, herbal measures can be quite effective against the various forms of mange. The foremost herb to consider is garlic. Mites don’t tolerate sulfur com- pounds, and garlic contains hundreds of them (which is why garlic smells like it does). For ear mites or localized mite infestations on birds and mammals, gar- lic oil can be applied to the affected areas twice daily. In addition to its direct inter- vention with mites, garlic oil helps mini- mize bacterial infection. When using gar- lic oil, however, make sure that it’s not too concentrated or it may cause irrita- tion. Another good ear mite herb is mullein flower oil. Mullein flowers pos- sess antiparasitic and antibacterial activi- ties that seem well suited to infections of the ear, especially when combined with garlic oil. Vitamin E oil can be added to this combination to help promote heal- ing. The olive oil used as a base for both of these oils also lends soothing and heal- ing qualities to the skin. For mange infestations that are local- ized close to the eyes of an animal, you will probably want to purchase or make an ointment or salve preparation. This minimizes the risk of the herb contacting the eyes. Herbs for Pets 272 Other herbs to consider for mite infec- tions are lavender, yarrow, Oregon grape, goldenseal (provided it is from cultivated sources), and licorice. Any of these herbs can be used in oils, salves, or ointments as well, or they can be made into a skin rinse (a good option for infections that are gen- eralized over larger portions of the ani- mal’s body). Licorice serves as a good alternative for animals who are sensitive to topical applications of garlic. If you have access to it, neem leaf (Azadirachta indica), from a tree found in India and Pakistan, can make an effective skin rinse against many forms of mange. For birds who are crawling with mites, a pinch of Oregon grape or lavender can be infused into their birdbath. For lizards with mite infections, a wet towel wipe of weak Oregon grape, yarrow, or lavender tea might help. LICE Several species of lice can infest both mammals and birds. They can generally be divided into two categories: those that suck blood from their hosts (Anopleura) and those that bite their vic- tims (Mallophaga). Regardless, the term lousy is derived from the concept of louse infestation, and the repulsiveness the word conveys describes the situation accurately. Louse infestation is a common problem for animals who live in cramped or unclean living quarters. The problem is characterized by irritated, itchy skin and frequent scratching. Lice are tough critters and can be hard to beat with herbs. The most effec- tive and time-honored herb approaches for lice include toxic heavyweights such as tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and even water hemlock (Cicuta spp.), either of which can kill an animal host. On the safer side of the herbal spectrum are licorice, yucca, wormwood, sage, yarrow, yellow dock, lavender, and bee balm. All of these herbs can be used singly or in combination in the form of a daily skin rinse. A daily sprinkling of diatomaceous earth onto the animal’s coat may be effective, too. INTESTINAL WORMS Worms are often viewed as parasites at their most disgusting worst, but again this is largely because we have a big problem with the thought of things crawling around inside our bodies. Sorry if this gives you the “crawlies,” but worms are a natural fact of life. We all have them in one form or another. Animal guardians tend to overreact to the possibility of worms with the precau- tionary use of chemical wormers. As we mentioned earlier, such practice is con- trary and counterproductive to the pur- poses of holistic health care. We are not saying that worms cannot be life threat- ening but that the health risks associated with preventive drug therapies may out- weigh the actual need for them, especial- ly in healthy animals who are not likely to be exposed to roundworms, whipworms, or hookworms. The most common type of intestinal parasites are known as cestodes, or tape- worms. Tapeworms can be transmitted by fleas, feces, or food sources. In rural areas, dogs and cats often become infected by eating rodents. Tapeworms may live in an animal’s digestive tract for quite a while, sometimes indefinitely, before they are detected, and they are seldom harmful to the host animal. Usually, we won’t even know that our companions have tapeworms until a fecal analysis is done or until we see the worms’ body segments in the animals’ stools. The segments (put your sandwich down!) look very much like grains of rice. The potential of tapeworms to cause harm to an animal is relative to the gen- eral health of the animal and the extent An Herbal Repertory for Animals 273 of the tapeworm infestation. In other words, if an animal is generally healthy, a moderate population of intestine- dwelling tapeworms is usually harmless. And if the animal is holistically healthy, has a strong immune system, properly balanced intestinal flora, and is being fed a good diet, tapeworm infestations are likely to be a temporary issue. For instance, we live on 60 remote acres in the Montana Rockies, where our two dogs roam freely around the house. Both occasionally eat a ground squirrel or two (sometimes in the form of carrion), and we expect both of them to have tape- worms by the end of summer. But because they are healthy, most if not all of the worms (as confirmed by fecal analysis) are gone from their bodies after a couple of months of infestation. The opportunity seekers just can’t find a stronghold, or they don’t like the accom- modations. It’s our contention that in most instances, the reason tapeworms are approached with chemical interventions is not always because a real and urgent need to eliminate them exists but because we can’t deal with their less- than-appealing nature. Yes, they’re dis- gusting. But are we really helping an ani- mal when we use unnecessary, potential- ly toxic measures to expel them? We don’t think so. Roundworms, hookworms, whip- worms, and threadworms present a much greater risk to your companion because these worms can cause severe intestinal damage and can leave the digestive tract to infest the blood and other organs. Once these parasites leave the digestive tract, they can be difficult to treat. To help your dog or cat keep intestin- al populations in check and to encourage earlier expulsion by less invasive, more natural means, garlic can be fed in mod- eration on the animal’s food. Fennel, grated raw carrot, shredded coconut, and cooked grains also might be of ben- efit if added to the animal’s diet. (Feed as much as the animal wants to eat.) Fresh, raw, unsalted pumpkin seeds help expel worms and generous portions can be fed as a wholesome treat to any animal. The seeds may need to be ground up and added to your pet’s food. (You can grind a small batch ahead of time and keep it in a jar in the freezer until you’re ready to use it.) Diatomaceous earth is effective at reducing intestinal parasite populations and can be fed at the following recom- mended rates (approved by the FDA)— large dogs over 55 pounds can have up to 1 tablespoon per day, small dogs and cats can have 1 teaspoon per day. Goats, sheep, cattle, horses, and other large ani- mals can be fed in portions up to 1 per- ANTIWORM FOOD SUPPLEMENT Combine the following dry ingre- dients: 2 parts unsalted, raw pumpkin seeds (ground or whole) 1 part garlic powder 1 part fennel seed 1 part yucca root Feed the mixture as part of your companion’s diet at a dosage of 1 teaspoon per pound of food fed daily. Feed five days on and two days off each week until worm pop- ulations are reduced to acceptable levels. If this formula proves to be ineffective, try adding 1 part Oregon grape root powder or 1 part wormwood. Herbs for Pets 274 cent of their daily dry rations; and chick- ens and most birds can receive up to 5 percent. Oregon grape may be given internally to birds, dogs, cats, horses, and other mammals as a low-alcohol tincture or decoction. A dose of 12 drops per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight (or just a few drops for birds), twice daily for up to one week is appropriate. After one week, give the animal’s system a break for two or three days before continuing the twice-daily doses. Chamomile has mild worm-expelling properties, and pineapple weed (Matricaria matricari- oides), a wild and weedy cousin of chamomile, is believed to possess much stronger activities against roundworms and whipworms. Other worming agents include black walnut and wormwood. Black walnut hull is an effective worming agent, but it must be used with care because of the potentially irritating tannin con- stituents it contains. Black walnut should not be used in or around horses, as it may be toxic to them. Wormwood, of course, is a classic dewormer, but it should not be used for long periods and not at all in animals with liver disease. Even more dangerous are tansy and rue. In our opinion, these herbs should be avoided altogether because they’re too harsh on the liver. Herbs that are rich in soaplike saponin constituents such as yucca, valerian, and licorice are sometimes effective as worm- ing agents. Yucca also helps by optimiz- ing absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, an attribute that might be use- ful in cases of severe infection in which nutrient absorption is hindered by the presence of too many hungry parasites. Many herbal wormers contain laxative or emetic herbs such as senna, cascara sagrada, aloe, or turkey rhubarb. The idea behind their inclusion is to flush out the parasites by stimulating bowel move- ment and loosening the stool. In holistic reality, this approach adds stress to the body, causes discomfort to the animal, may cause dehydration and nutrient depletion, and may lead to laxative dependency if used for too long a period. The overall effectiveness of expelling worms is outweighed by the invasiveness of the therapy. If constipation is associat- ed with a worm infestation, marshmal- low, plantain, or slippery elm can be used to lubricate the digestive tract without pulling needed fluids from the body, and hepatics such as yellow dock, Oregon grape, or a small pinch of turmeric can be fed to increase bile production and improve digestion. Slippery elm or plan- tain may be beneficial in cases of worm- related diarrhea because these herbs con- tain astringent qualities that gently regu- late the passage of fluid into the intes- tine. A safe, general worming remedy that can be added to your companion’s food can be found on page 273. GIARDIASIS Giardiasis is a digestive disease caused by cyst-forming impregnation of protozoa of the Giardia genus in the mucosal lining of the intestines. The result is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other flulike symptoms for several weeks. The most common means of infestation comes from ingestion of water that has been contaminated by the fecal matter of fish and other animals. Animals are much more resistant to Giardia than humans are, but they are still susceptible. As with all parasites, severity of infestation depends on the overall health of the host. Symptoms range from loss of appetite to diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, and general debility. Herbal interventions are moderately successful at best. Tinctures are the best form of application here because their high concentrations of readily available An Herbal Repertory for Animals 275 constituents are needed against these tough little beasties. Of particular interest are Oregon grape, goldenseal (from cul- tivated sources), and other herbs that contain the active alkaloid constituent berberine. Berberine, being water solu- ble, highly assimilable, and able to with- stand the digestive acids that destroy many other types of antibiotic agents, finds it way deep into the digestive tract to work its wonders, especially when given in concentrated extract form over periods of several days. Garlic may lend antiprotozoa support as well. Licorice is a good adjunct, lending antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and healing proper- ties to the effort. Cleavers helps drain lymph-engorged tissues that surround the cysts. HEARTWORM The term heartworm is really a mis- nomer, as the parasitic worm (Dirofilaria immitis) that causes the disease usually infects the pulmonary arteries, not the heart itself. Heartworm is generally passed by mosquitoes, who pick up the parasite from the bloodstreams of dogs (less fre- quently from cats and ferrets) while the worms are in their prelarval stage. While inside the mosquito, the infant parasites called microfilaria mature into infective adults that are deposited into other host animals. After two to four months, the parasites penetrate blood vessel walls and travel to the pulmonary arteries, where they reproduce if conditions are right. While the worms are in the pul- monary arteries, the body launches an immunologic attack against them. If the worms have already reproduced to num- bers that the immune system cannot effectively control, an allergic response ensues, and the pulmonary arteries and surrounding lung tissues may become severely inflamed, causing a life-threaten- ing situation. Animals with advanced stages of heartworm infestation may exhibit chronic coughing; labored breathing; diminished physical stamina and a low tolerance to stress; weight loss; and heart failure. Unfortunately, the scenario becomes even more frightening when we consider conventional treatment of the disease, which involves the use of thiacetar- samide, an intravenously administered arsenic derivative that poisons the para- sites at great expense to the host animal’s liver. In our opinion and that of several holistic veterinarians, the deworming medication ivermectin and other preven- A REMEDY FOR GIARDIASIS Combine the following tinctures: 2 parts Oregon grape 2 parts licorice 2 parts cleavers 1 part garlic This formula can be fed to dogs, cats, birds, horses, and other large herbivores at least one hour before feeding, at a dosage of about 1⁄4 tea- spoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily for up to ten days. If positive results aren’t seen within ten days, it’s time to call your holistic vet. Low-alcohol tinctures are best because of their relative ease of administering, but alcohol tinctures can be used provided they are dilut- ed to half-strength with water, which means you will have to give the animal twice the liquid volume. Herbs for Pets 276 tive measures for heartworm can also be detrimental to an animal, which brings us to an especially important point in the prevention of the disease. In some areas of the U.S., heartworm is a real and constant threat to compan- ion animals. But in many areas of North America, it is more of a fear-induced paranoia than an actual danger. In Montana, for instance (where we live), heartworm is almost unheard of. Unfortunately, horror stories about heart- worm lead many people to medicate their animals anyway. We believe that people should rationally weigh the pros and cons as well as the need of adminis- tering a preventive heartworm treatment to their animal companions. Another problem arises from the blood and antigen tests that are per- formed to detect heartworms. In these tests, 30 percent of infested dogs do not test positive, meaning that the disease may progress unchecked. Likewise, a positive test for heartworm does not nec- essarily mean that the parasites will become problematic, especially if the host animal is healthy. Natural prevention of heartworm begins with identifying just how much “at risk” your companion is. If you live in a high-risk area, your animal’s coat should never be cut. Allow it to grow to full length and serve its natural function as an antimosquito barrier. Areas where mosquito populations are especially high (such as swamps, sloughs, and other breeding grounds) should be avoided, and perhaps a tightly knit cotton or breathable nylon garment is in order for shorthaired dogs. (Several clothing cat- alogs for dogs are available.) Proper nutrition and tonic immune system sup- port will build and maintain your com- panion’s resistance to the parasite. In addition to a full array of supplemental vitamins and minerals, garlic can be added to an animal’s diet to strengthen the immune system. When venturing into higher-risk areas, echinacea can be preventatively administered for two or three days before the excursion and continue for three days after. If your animal does contract heart- worm, don’t panic. Instead, continue supporting the immune system and call your holistic veterinarian to determine the next step of action. There are many options. Among them may be black wal- nut hull tincture (made from unripe green hulls instead of dried ones). As of 1999, we had been contacted by several individuals who claim that black walnut hull may be effective at controlling the parasites. Given what we know about this herb and the parasite, we remain skepti- cal but hopeful that clinical use will vali- date this claim. Pregnancy and Lactation One of the most frequently asked ques- tions we hear as animal herbalists is, What should I be giving to a pregnant animal? Our response is often a cause of disappointment: Aside from the elements of good nutrition, as little as possible. During pregnancy and lactation, a mother’s body is in a state of continual hormonal fluctuation. Her nutritional demands change as her body experi- ences a roller-coaster ride of metabolic events that are incomparable to any other experience. It is a period when her body must maintain delicate checks and balances while responding to unprece- dented demands. These are times when the proactive efforts of an animal herbal- ist really pay off. Having received a good natural diet, a healthy living environ- ment, and complementary measures of health-supporting vitamin, mineral, and herb supplements throughout her life, the pregnant animal is physically and mentally prepared to undertake the rig- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 277 ors of childbirth and motherhood. This is a time when the body should be allowed to work its natural wonders without interference from introduced stimulation, suppression, or irritation. With this in mind, the bigger and better question is, What herbs shouldn’t be used in preg- nant or lactating animals? HERBS TO AVOID Many herbs should not be given to pregnant or lactating animals. Herbs that contain considerable amounts of volatile oil constituents such as juniper, any of the aromatic mints, and parsley seed should not be used during preg- nancy because the oils are capable of crossing the placenta to the fetus. Volatile oils may also infiltrate a moth- er’s milk, so these herbs should be avoided during lactation as well. Herbs that stimulate or suppress hormone production should also be avoided— these include licorice, wild yam, and yucca root. Herbs that are high in tan- nin constituents such as uva ursi, white oak bark, black walnut hulls, and slip- pery elm may cause uterine contrac- tions and miscarriage. Herbal laxatives that contain anthraquinone con- stituents such as senna, cascara sagra- da, turkey rhubarb, and yellow dock should be avoided as well. If your com- panion becomes constipated during pregnancy, try lubricating her digestive tract by feeding marshmallow, flaxseed, or psyllium husks. Chickweed can also serve as a safe and effective laxative in pregnant animals. Herbs that contain large percentages of bitter alkaloids such as Oregon grape and goldenseal may have abortifacient activities and should not be used. Red clover, feverfew, and ginkgo all inhibit platelet aggregation in the blood and may contribute to excessive hemor- rhage during or after birthing. In summary, if you’re not sure about the safety of an herb during pregnancy, assume that it’s contraindicated and don’t use it! TONIC SUPPORT Contrary to what many herbalists regard as tradition, we do not use most of the “classic birthing and pregnancy herbs” (such as blue cohosh) during this fragile time. Instead, our approach is strictly nutritive. Raspberry leaf tea has been long regarded as an excellent uterine tonic for pregnant humans and animals, but it should not be given during the first few weeks of pregnancy. Nor should it be fed in large amounts, as there is a small risk that its astringent activities may trig- ger abortion in sensitive animals (espe- cially cats). In our opinion, nettle leaf and spirulina are both better choices as uter- ine tonics because they contain higher concentrations and broader assortments of essential and trace minerals and vita- mins. This means they can be fed more conservatively, and the risk (as low as that risk may be) of inducing uterine con- tractions is thereby reduced. HERBS AND LACTATION Healthy animals who receive all necessary elements of nutrition during motherhood should have no problems with milk pro- duction or quality. If a nursing mother is not providing her young with enough milk, it’s probably because of a nutrition- al deficiency, hormonal imbalance, or another dysfunction. Fennel seed, bor- age, dill, and yucca root are all said to increase milk production in nursing mothers, but these herbs are useful only to healthy animals who need more milk to feed a big, hungry litter. If your dog or cat has given birth to a small- or average- sized litter and is having trouble feeding her young, then deeper problems need to be addressed before you start trying to Herbs for Pets 278 induce milk production. Forcing a moth- er’s body to perform beyond its capacity with estrogenic herbs may only worsen an already serious situation. In many cases, switching an animal from a com- mercial diet to one that offers a diversity of whole, raw foods makes a world of dif- ference. Moderate quantities of supple- mental vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and EFAs can be of tremendous help as well because lactation can deplete an animal’s reserve supply of vital nutrients. In cats, this depletion can cause a life- threatening deficiency of taurine, an amino acid that is critical to the heart. Respiratory Problems COUGHING AND SNEEZING: NATURAL HEALING MECHANISMS Occasional coughing or sneezing is part of a body’s normal health maintenance program. Most animal guardians know that when dust particles, pollen, or other foreign matter enters the trachea, spasms are triggered to expel the material from the body. Yet many people try to sup- press coughing and sneezing rather than allow the body to do its job because the conventional Western mind-set dictates that anything that is socially offensive or that causes discomfort must be sup- pressed. To tend to an animal’s holistic health needs, we must learn to control our urge to interfere with the body’s nat- ural functions. Suppressing activities such as sneezing, coughing, and discharging mucus deprives the body of its natural healing mechanisms and may actually contribute to the underlying disease by prohibiting expulsion of pathogenic microbes and other foreign substances. Instead of suppressing disease symp- toms, the holistic healer’s efforts are cen- tered on assisting the body to cleanse and heal itself. In the respiratory tract, this entails supporting and encouraging the productivity of coughing, sneezing, and expulsion of mucus. Most animals do not produce mucus as readily as humans do. Therefore, herbs and other remedies that serve as cough suppressants or dis- courage expectoration (such as wild cherry bark) should be reserved for spe- cial circumstances, such as when a con- tinuous, unproductive cough has deprived an animal of sleep for several days. Even then, such remedies should be used in moderation as adjuncts to herbs that support productive coughing. Many respiratory ailments can be treated at home with some simple herbal preparations. But if your companion’s coughing or sneezing continues or wors- ens, or if you have any doubt whatsoever about its cause, you should have your friend examined by a holistic vet. A per- sistent cough can mean minor throat irri- tation caused by chewing on a stick, or it can be a symptom of a life-threatening situation such as heartworm, pneumo- nia, cardiopulmonary disease, or a seri- ous viral infection. ASTHMA Asthma is characterized by a sudden onset of bronchial inflammation and res- piratory distress. Animals with severe asthma may begin an attack by wheez- ing, sneezing, and coughing, which may quickly progress to obstructed airways, labored breathing, and a life-threatening crisis. According to most veterinarians, dogs do not suffer from asthma, but this disease is known to occur frequently in cats and many other animals. Many people regard asthma as a cause of respiratory distress, but in most cases it’s really only a symptom of a deeper immune-mediated disorder. Asthma usually occurs as part of a severe allergic reaction. Therefore, holistic treat- ment does not focus solely on suppres- sion of asthma attacks but also on proac- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 279 tive correction of the dysfunctional mechanisms that trigger the attacks. (For more information on long-term holistic treatment, see “Allergies” in the “Immune System Care” sections of this chapter.) Symptomatic herbal treatments for non-life-threatening cases of asthma are essentially the same as those used for kennel cough and other forms of bron- chitis (see below). Lobelia may be useful for suppressing asthma attacks in cats, especially if a tincture is administered at the first signs of onset. Lobeline, the active constituent of lobelia, is potential- ly toxic (it has central nervous system effects similar to those of nicotine), so it should be administered only under the direction of a holistic veterinarian. BRONCHITIS AND KENNEL COUGH The term bronchitis refers to inflamma- tion of one or more of the large air pas- sages of the lungs. Causes are variable, ranging from inhalation of dust and other airborne irritants to viral, bacterial, or fungal infection; tumors; or cancer. An accumulation of mucus in the bronchi and a deep, rumbling cough are usually associated with bronchitis. Bronchitis that is secondary to bacter- ial, fungal, or viral infection is often accompanied by elevated body tempera- ture and mucus discharge. If your com- panion is coughing up fluid, take an unpleasant moment to examine it. If it’s pink, frothy, blood streaked, or bright yellow, get your companion and a speci- men of the discharge to a veterinarian immediately. Respiratory infections or bleeding progress rapidly and need to be treated aggressively. Kennel cough is a generic term for a dry, hacking cough that occurs in dogs and sometimes cats. It is caused by viral (such as canine adenovirus II, parain- fluenza) or bacterial infection (such as Bordetella bronchiseptica) and is generally self-limiting in that it rarely progresses beyond minor inflammation of the tra- chea. No discharge, fever, respiratory edema, or other symptoms are associ- ated with kennel cough—just coughing. This is an important point to remember because if your animal is exhibiting symptoms in addition to a hacking cough, you may be facing a condition more serious than kennel cough. Once diagnosed, kennel cough and most other types of bronchitis can be treated safely at home. If other animals in the home are susceptible to infection, take preventive measures to keep them healthy. We administer immune-support- ive herbs to our animals before, during, and after suspected exposure to infec- tious bronchitis. Dietary supplementation of fresh chopped garlic is a good preven- tive measure because garlic has excellent immunotonic qualities and antibacterial and antiviral principles that are exhaled Elecampane can decrease the symptoms and shorten the duration of bronchitis and kennel cough. Herbs for Pets 280 through the lungs. Astragalus or organi- cally grown echinacea are also well suit- ed for boosting your companion’s immune system against kennel cough before or during an infection. Eucalyptus essential oil can be placed into a vaporiz- er with some water and left within a few feet of your companion’s resting quar- ters. (Don’t use this method in conjunc- tion with a homeopathic prescription, as it may antidote the remedy.) The vapor helps open the animal’s respiratory pas- sages and provides a continuous measure of antimicrobial intervention. Coltsfoot, grindelia, mullein leaf, and elecampane offer antiviral, antibacterial, expectorant, and antispasmodic quali- ties that can help shorten the duration of your companion’s ailment. Yarrow is also strongly antimicrobial and helps increase pulmonary efficiency by dilat- ing blood vessels of the lungs. Slippery elm, plantain, and marshmallow each lend soothing relief to sore and inflamed AN HERBAL FORMULA FOR ASTHMA, KENNEL COUGH, AND BRONCHITIS WITH DRY COUGH* Combine the following low-alcohol (glycerin) tinctures: 1 part coltsfoot 1 part grindelia or elecampane 1 part mullein leaf 1 part yarrow 1 part marshmallow * This formula eases spastic cough- ing, fights bacterial infection, and soothes inflamed membranes. This combination can be added to a small amount of honey and fed to dogs or cats two or three times daily until the illness has run its course. An appropriate dose is 0.25–0.5 milliliters for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Additionally, a twice-daily dose of echinacea or astragalus is recommended for immune support. If the coughing is associated with nervousness or hyperexcitability, bugleweed, skullcap, valerian, hop, or a small measure of wild cherry bark can be added to the twice- daily regimen. AN HERBAL FORMULA FOR WET COUGHS 1 part coltsfoot 1 part goldenrod 1 part yarrow If your companion’s cough involves copious amounts of thick, hard-to- expel mucus, this formula serves to reduce inflammation of mucous membranes, reduce and thin mu- cous secretions in the bronchi, and help to make the cough less violent and more productive. This formula can be added to a small amount of honey and fed to dogs or cats two or three times daily until the illness has run its course. An appropriate dose is 0.25–0.5 milli- liters for each 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 281 membranes of the trachea and bronchi. Goldenrod is especially helpful in cases in which bronchial inflammation is yielding excessive mucus that the body cannot effectively expel (e.g., bronchial pneumonia). PNEUMONIA AND PULMONARY EDEMA Pneumonia is a condition in which lung volume and pulmonary efficiency is reduced by the presence of fluid (edema) or a solid mass (tumor). Pneumonia can originate from bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan infection; allergy; cancer; injury, or systemic dysfunction. Pneumonia is a life-threatening situation that can be pro- gressive. Treatment varies according to the cause and symptoms. The term pulmonary edema refers to the presence of fluid in the lungs. With few exceptions (such as drowning), pul- monary edema is secondary to other dis- orders, such as congestive heart failure, inhalation of toxic chemicals, or damage of lung tissues. In cases of pneumonia or pulmonary edema, pulmonary (lung) efficiency is reduced so the blood does not receive the oxygen it needs to supply tissues throughout the body. In other words, the body progressively suffocates as the con- dition worsens. Symptoms at onset include reduced physical stamina; coughing, panting, or gasping for air; and diminished mental capacity. As the situation worsens, the tongue and mucous membranes of the eyes begin to turn blue from lack of oxygen, the animal becomes weak and lethargic, and the brain and other vital organs begin to die. Even if you have only a hunch that your animal may have pneumonia or a condi- tion involving pulmonary edema, the first course of action is to consult a veterinar- ian immediately to rule out the possibili- ty of a life-threatening situation. Don’t hesitate. Pneumonia can be aggressive in animals, especially those who are aging or weakened by chronic illness. Conventional approaches usually involve the use of furosemide or other strong diuretics to help move fluid out of the lungs, as well as antibiotic therapies directed toward any bacteria or fungi that might be involved. Once the nature of the problem has been identified and the animal’s condi- tion has stabilized, herbs can be used to strengthen the immune system and sup- port the body in its efforts to regain well- being. Large doses of a strong, dark dan- delion leaf tea (as much as you can get the animal to drink) serves as a strong diuretic to help with the elimination of fluid from the lungs. If the animal won’t drink the tea, use a salt-free meat or veg- etable broth instead of hot water or A TONIC FORMULA FOR ANIMALS WITH PNEUMONIA Combine the following glycerin- based herb tinctures: 2 parts echinacea 1 part astragalus 1 part coltsfoot 1 part yarrow This formula can be added to dan- delion leaf tea and fed two or three times daily until the disease has run its course. The dose for dogs, cats, and other small animals is 0.25–0.5 milliliters for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Horses and other large herbivores can receive 20–30 milliliters. Herbs for Pets 282 sweeten the tea with honey. Unlike the aforementioned furosemide, dandelion helps replace potassium and other nutri- ents that are usually lost through increased urination. Dandelion leaf tea should be fed con- tinuously. Provide as much as the animal will take throughout the therapy. Echinacea and garlic can be used to boost your companion’s immune system, and astragalus or Siberian ginseng may increase his body’s ability to function under the added stress. Coltsfoot and ele- campane are both good choices for stimu- lating respiratory function, inhibiting bac- terial reproduction, and helping with the elimination of mucus from the bronchi. Inhalation therapy using a vaporizer and eucalyptus oil (as mentioned for bronchi- tis) can also bring relief. Yarrow and cayenne can both increase pulmonary cir- culation and increase oxygen delivery to the blood. Used in combination with the diuretic qualities of dandelion leaf, these two herbs may be especially useful for racehorses who suffer acute respiratory bleeding and pulmonary edema as a result of strenuous exercise. Cayenne can also be used as part of this program as a respirato- ry stimulant and to assist the activities of the other herbs—one small gel cap daily for dogs and cats and five to ten large gel caps daily for horses. In animals who are suffering pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart fail- ure or other cardiopulmonary problems, hawthorn, ginkgo, or bugleweed may be indicated. Other herbs worth considering in a wide variety of respiratory problems include horehound (excellent, but hard to administer because of its bitterness), thyme, rosemary, and lovage. Skin Problems Skin is something we tend to take for granted. After all, we see it all the time. It covers our dogs, cats, horses, birds, and our own bodies. And unlike treat- ments for a diseased organ that is hid- den deep and mysteriously within the body, our approaches to skin disorders are often as shallow as we perceive the skin itself to be. The skin regulates body temperature as well as peripheral blood and lymph cir- culation and provides frontline protec- tion from harmful influences that exist outside the body. The skin also helps with the elimination of systemic wastes that are not effectively eliminated through the urinary and digestive tracts. Therefore, what might appear to be nothing more than a superficial annoyance such as a skin disorder might indicate a serious underlying disease. Animals don’t com- plain as much as people do and are unable to express the discomforts of a deep-seated disease. That means the causes of a chronic skin problem may go unnoticed until they progress to a point where an animal is noticeably suffering from a condition such as arthritis, liver disease, kidney failure, or even cancer. Compounding the problem is the diffi- culty of accurately identifying the under- lying causes of many skin-related disor- ders—the list of possible causes is almost unlimited. As a result, many convention- al therapies amount to nothing more than relief of surface symptoms. In conventional veterinary medicine, skin problems are most often treated as conditions occurring on the outside of the body, and a common course of ther- apy typically involves topical creams, salves, rinses, or shampoos. When these external measures fail, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or other drugs are usually prescribed to depress the immune sys- tem and thereby squelch the uncomfort- able symptoms. While this approach to skin disease can ease an animal’s discom- fort quickly or even make the disease appear to go away, the underlying causes An Herbal Repertory for Animals 283 of the disease may never be considered, much less acted upon. As a result, they may progress to other, more serious problems. In human dermatology, eczema or psoriasis present excellent examples. Both are viewed by Western medicine as symptomatic manifestations of various systemic or external causes such as hormonal imbalances; systemic dysfunction; or viral, fungal, or bacterial infection; but the reasons the body allows such problems to occur remain largely unknown. In the absence of cura- tive answers, only the symptoms are addressed. The principles of holistic herbal medi- cine do not allow healers to employ solu- tions that address only the surface mani- festations of disease. While it’s true that finding a cure for chronic skin disorders is as difficult for holistic healers as it is for conventional research scientists, we are gifted with a special weapon: a holistic perspective that enables us to help the body find a cure for itself. The holistic herbal approach to skin disease reaches beyond symptoms to accept the fact that the body has mysterious but powerful abilities to heal itself. Fully understanding these abilities is not absolutely necessary. The function of the herbalist is not to substitute the body’s natural methods of treating disease with new methods but to assist the body in healing itself natural- ly. This applies to all forms of skin disease. Whether the problem is a contact der- matitis that can be quickly relieved with an application of herbal salve or a more complex condition that emanates from within the body to create chronic sebor- rhea, the approach is to assist the body’s efforts to heal while trying to identify and address the underlying causes. Writing comprehensively on herbal approaches to animal skin problems would entail writing an entire book—per- haps even multiple volumes. So instead we present some generalized herbal treatments with strong emphases on the holistic principles by which they are most effectively applied, for a few of the most common skin problems in companion animals. SKIN PROBLEMS OF INTERNAL ORIGIN Chronic, or recurring, skin conditions that cannot be attributed to elements outside the body usually indicate sys- temic disease. Generally speaking, if an animal’s body system cannot effectively eliminate waste or if foreign bodies or toxins cannot be effectively dealt with by a strong immune system, the body tries to push the problem outward, away from the vital organs. When the body resorts to such measures, it is usually because one or more of the organs or body sys- tems that monitor and respond to for- eign bodies and systemic waste have somehow become dysfunctional. The liver, kidneys, and immune and lymph systems become overburdened, the skin is asked to take actions it cannot take, and a “skin problem” erupts in the form of an oily, flaky coat; irritated, itchy skin; subcutaneous cysts; excessive hair loss; pus-filled eruptions, and so forth. Treating skin conditions that are sec- ondary to systemic disorders is difficult. Persistent skin conditions such as sebor- rhea (dry or greasy, flaky or scaly skin) or pyoderma (pus-filled eruptions) may be attributable to any number of deep-seat- ed factors, including dietary deficiencies, food or environmental allergies, immune system disease, or a microbial infection that may or may not be evident upon analysis of the skin itself. In such cases, the entire system must be evaluated, sys- temic deficiencies must be identified and corrected, and the search for direct caus- es must continue throughout the thera- py, even if the symptoms are under con- Herbs for Pets 284 trol. The golden rule to remember is this: The outward symptoms of many types of chronic skin disease represent only a small part of the holistic picture. We can- not expect to find curative solutions unless we focus our efforts beyond the symptoms to identify and address the underlying causes. This rule applies to all forms of skin disease, from an allergic response to fleabites to chronic hair loss. SKIN PROBLEMS OF EXTERNAL ORIGIN Skin problems that are triggered from outside the body are often, but not always, easier to identify and quicker to correct than those that emanate from within. For example, the cause of recur- rent urticaria (an inflammation of the skin surface characterized by small, itching welts) may be quickly identified and eliminated when it is discovered that Rover has been sleeping in a patch of stinging nettles growing along the back- yard fence. In this case, the holistic approach might be to neutralize the stinging acids with a dandelion flower or nettle tea rinse. A problem such as der- matophytosis, or ringworm, a parasitic fungal infection of the skin in dogs, cats, horses, and many other animals (includ- ing humans), presents the holistic care- giver with a more complex scenario. Ringworm is passed directly from an infected environment to the animal host. And like most parasites, including fleas and various skin-burrowing mites (sar- coptic mange, barn itch, demodectic mange, to name a few), ringworm is more likely to infect diseased or immuno- compromised animals than those with healthy disease resistance. Therefore, to holistically treat an animal suffering from ringworm, we must take the animal’s environment and his general state of health into consideration. Ringworm can be largely prevented by keeping the liv- ing environment clean, but infection must also be discouraged by maintaining the health of the potential host. This brings us right back to our main point: Before other causative factors can be addressed, the overall health of the individual must be fully evaluated and supported. HOLISTIC APPROACHES It’s important to keep in mind that herbs alone are seldom curative solutions to chronic forms of disease. In holistic med- icine, most skin problems are viewed as indicators of systemic dysfunction within the body. Rather than working in ways that exclude natural body functions (as many drugs do) to suppress the symp- toms of disease, herbs serve best as func- tional adjuncts to a variety of other cor- rective measures. Nutrition; the animal’s age; his physical, psychological, and neu- rological conditions; genetic predisposi- tions characteristic to his breed; and the quality of his living environment must be taken into account as equal parts of a holistic health picture. Feeding the Skin Your effectiveness at treating conditions such as flaky skin and a dull coat is gauged by how deeply you are willing to look into your animal’s whole body, lifestyle, and environment. To begin the healing process, some careful measures must be taken to assure that the skin is properly fed. Start with a critical assess- ment of your companion’s diet, looking not just at the diversity and types of food ingredients but at the quality of each ingredient as well. The skin is an organ that must continually regenerate itself to survive the constant effects of aging and bombardment from environmental ele- ments. To do so it must receive a unique array of special nutrients and nutritional adjuncts, many of which will not be An Herbal Repertory for Animals 285 found in a typical commercial diet. At the top of this special-requirement list are antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E), miner- als, proteins, and especially EFAs, which can be administered to an animal through supplementing his diet. Essential fatty acid supplements might include flaxseed powder or oil, fish oil, or wheat germ oil. Vitamins A, C, and E are needed for their regenerative and antioxi- dant effects, and digestive enzymes are also required. In terms of herbs, horsetail and gotu kola may help regenerate and strengthen skin structure; and nutritive herbs such as spirulina, nettle, alfalfa, and red clover can provide trace minerals and antioxidant vitamins. Fresh burdock root is available at many health food stores and can be grated (raw) directly into your ani- mal’s food. Burdock is considered a specif- ic alterative for chronic skin problems. It is safe and nutritious and gently supports an animal’s liver and gallbladder. Feed your animal as much as he likes. The quality of protein you are feeding also plays a vital role here—low-grade pro- teins (such as soy-based fillers and most meat by-products) are difficult for animals to metabolize, and instead of being received as nutritive protein, they are treated as hard-to-eliminate wastes. By feeding your animal a diversity of high- quality, fresh foods and the proper nutri- tional supplements, you are equipping him with the components he needs to maintain healthy skin. Without the proper nutritional components, the skin becomes weak and vulnerable to the effects of the environment, its related body functions become compromised, and the entire sys- tem falls out of holistic balance. Piecing Together a Puzzle Once you are sure that your companion is getting the nutritional components needed for healthy skin and coat, consid- er the potential sources of any chronic problem. Does your animal have a food allergy? This can often be determined by removing food ingredients from the diet one at a time. For a dog or cat, start by changing the type of meat your animal is eating—especially if he is eating beef or a food that is made from mostly one type of meat. Next, try weeding out grains and yeast one at a time. Start by eliminat- ing soy, then try wheat, then yeast. While you are ruling out food aller- gies, also consider anything else that may be compromising your companion’s immune system. It is the immune sys- tem’s job to react to invading microbes or harmful substances. If the system is compromised and cannot react correctly or effectively, it may overreact, causing an allergic response. Is your companion hypersensitive to fleabites? Is the animal subjected to fre- quent vaccinations (a major cause of many skin and immune system prob- lems, in our opinion), protracted antibi- otic therapies, or any environmental tox- ins that may be depressing or stimulating immune functions? Find out the answers. Any of these factors may contribute to a chronic skin problem. After you have an idea of what might be entering your companion’s body to trigger the problem, then start looking for telltale signs of which organs or body systems might be affected. Is your animal friend suffering from constipation or diar- rhea, and does his skin, coat, or breath smell bad? If so, the digestive system and liver probably need herbal support. Is the urine concentrated and strong smelling, or does it have blood in it? Are urinary infections or stones a problem? In these cases, you need to optimize urinary effi- ciency and perhaps relieve inflammation in the urinary tract and kidneys. It’s impossible to ask yourself too many questions when looking for clues to the causes of a chronic skin problem. Herbs for Pets 286 Just remember to conduct your investiga- tion throughout the body, focusing on the organs and systems responsible for elimination of waste: the liver, kidneys, gallbladder, stomach and intestines, immune system, and lymph system. If you’re having problems doing this your- self, ask your holistic vet for help. HERBAL THERAPIES Since most forms of skin disease are relat- ed to poor elimination of systemic waste or immune system deficiency, a great deal can be accomplished by supporting the liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, immune system, and digestive functions with herbs. You should begin tonic herbal therapy while you are trying to pinpoint the actual causes of disease. Using tonic herbs to gently support the body’s cleansing systems helps the body to heal itself. Oftentimes, tonic alterative herbs change the course of systemic dys- function, and the body regains its ability to deal with whatever was triggering the skin problem. In these cases, the animal’s body finds its own cure, even though you never identify a cause. The herbs of choice for treating skin problems are stimulatory tonics and alter- natives that can be used safely over a long period as daily dietary supplements. Burdock has long been regarded as a spe- cific alterative for treating chronic forms of dermatitis. Cleavers improves lymph circu- lation, thus helping to remove waste and toxins from body tissues. It is also a diuret- ic and is mildly astringent, so it reduces inflammation that may exist in the urinary tract while encouraging elimination. Dandelion (root and leaf) is diuretic and nutritive and serves as a safe and reliable liver stimulant. It increases bile production and gently stimulates the gallbladder and the kidneys to help improve digestion and aid in the elimination of both solid and urine-carried wastes. Red clover helps bur- dock work and adds antioxidant and immune supportive qualities to a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals. It is generally considered to be a blood purifi- er because it helps improve blood struc- ture, which in turn allows for better trans- port of waste products and toxins from the body. Garlic offers immune system support, liver support, antimicrobial activ- ities, and antioxidant properties. All these herbs are ingredients in the following for- mula for skin problems. As the symptoms and mechanisms of a chronic skin problem become more defined, herbs can be used to provide added support to specific body systems in need. Herbs can also be used to relieve uncomfortable symptoms. The ingredi- ents of the Basic Support Formula (see box on page 287) can then be adjusted to suit special needs. For instance, for a dog suffering from seborrhea attributed to food-borne heavy metals (a condition your holistic vet must diagnose), a short- term regimen of yellow dock can be added to the formula to help to quickly eliminate toxic buildups of metals or chemicals in the body. For an animal with a skin disorder associated with chronic constipation, Oregon grape may be use- ful to quickly increase bile production from the liver and improve digestion and elimination of waste, while marshmallow may also benefit the animal by lubricat- ing the colon. When using herbs to relieve the symp- toms of disease, it’s important to keep your perspective holistic. Remember, symptoms are valuable evidence of what’s going on within an animal’s body—don’t suppress them unless you are finished using them to determine corrective measures for the underlying problem. For instance, if you use licorice to relieve your companion’s inflamed skin without improving his diet, the goal of finding a curative solution will never be reached. Dermatitis—a symp- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 287 BASIC SUPPORT FORMULA Combine the following: 2 parts burdock root 2 parts cleavers * 1 part dandelion, in equal proportions of root and leaf 1 part red clover (flowering tops) 1 part fresh organic garlic powder *Tincture, tea, or the pressed juice of the fresh herb must be used Flaxseed oil, evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, fish oil, or a prepared multi-EFA supplement should be fed to the animal with this formula. This formula can be used in several forms. A combination of the dried ingredi- ents (except cleavers) can be fed directly to an animal or sprinkled onto his food daily at a rate of 1 tablespoon per 40 pounds of the animal’s body weight. The cleavers has to be added in the form of a liquid preparation because it oxidizes quickly and loses its potency when dried. Therefore, 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) of a glycerin-based cleavers tincture or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of strong cleavers tea should be fed in place of the dry herb for each 40 pounds of an animal’s body weight. For cats, ferrets, rabbits, birds, and other small animals, the dosage is pro- rated according to the animal’s estimated weight. A parrot, for example, needs only a few drops of the tincture each day. Another option that is particularly good for horses, goats, llamas, and other herbivores is to administer the Basic Support Formula as fresh herbs. For these large animals, a few heaping handfuls of the herb mix should suffice each day. For rabbits and other small vegetarians, 1⁄2 cup of the mixture can be fed. If the animal eats a portion of the serving and then stops, it might mean that he has received all he needs. Take the remainder away. Cats, dogs, and other carnivores can be fed a raw mixture too, but keep in mind that they may have problems swallowing the cleavers—especially if it is Galium aparine, the species most com- monly used for herbal medicine. Galium aparine has a clinging nature that caus- es it to stick in the throats of animals who are not accustomed to eating live weeds. While this situation is not life threatening, it can cause some gagging and coughing. You may choose to feed your animal a species of Galium that does not share this characteristic, such as Northern bedstraw (Galium boreale—a common weed), or a garden variety such as sweet woodruff, (Galium odoratum) which does not have a sticky nature. It’s important to remember that the intent of this formula is to assist organ functions and to optimize the body’s absorption of needed nutrients. Providing a high-quality, natural diet is therefore paramount. It’s also important to keep in mind that tonic herbs, being noninvasive, work only at the body’s natural pace. Therefore, a tonic herbal therapy may take several days or even weeks to show results. Be patient, and allow your companion’s body an opportunity to heal itself. tom—may be temporarily relieved with licorice, but the underlying causes can- not be addressed unless we look at the entire problem holistically. SEBORRHEA Seborrhea is a term that is widely used for any form of skin-related disease char- acterized by dry or greasy, inflamed or itchy skin. Seborrhea may stem from any number of possibilities. At the top of the list are poor food quality and nutritional deficiency, followed by flea- or food- related allergies, vaccinosis, and exces- sive antibiotic use. Bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic (mite) infection and immune system dysfunction are also possible causes. Conventional treatment of seborrhea typically begins with the use of medicat- ed shampoos and topical steroid and antibiotic preparations. In cases in which clinical diagnosis identifies skin infec- tions, these measures can bring quick relief, but they usually do not address the reasons the skin became infected in the first place. Antibiotic and corticosteroid therapies are often used in cases of sebor- rhea that do not respond to topical treat- ment. From a holistic standpoint however, such measures compound the situation by inducing their own levels of systemic imbalance. Antibiotic and steroid thera- pies may make the symptoms disappear, but the underlying cause continues to go unchecked; the disease may be pushed deeper into the body and result in a much more serious disorder. The holistic approach begins when we realize that seborrhea is not really a dis- ease itself but a term used for a variety of skin-related disorders. There is no stan- dard herbal treatment to use for every kind of seborrhea. All forms of chronic skin disease, however, have two things in com- mon: all are connected to diet and all are less likely to occur or progress in animals who have healthy waste elimination and strong immune systems. Diet should be critically evaluated and improved to optimize the animal’s resist- ance to disease. Supplemental EFAs (e.g., flaxseed), digestive enzymes, minerals, and vitamins (especially vitamins E, A, and C) should be provided, and the possibility of food allergies should be considered. Herbs for Pets 288 ASTRINGENT HEALING SKIN RINSE Combine the following: 1 part juniper or uva ursi leaf decoction* 1 part calendula flowers, steeped into a strong tea 1 part peppermint *See “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1 for instructions on mak- ing a decoction Combine all ingredients, herb mate- rial and all, and allow the mixture to stand until cooled. Strain the cooled fluid through a sieve, then soak the animal’s skin and coat (avoid the eyes) with the solution. Let the ani- mal drip dry. If the animal insists on licking off the solution, you can use the rinse as a fomentation—wrap an old towel or cloth (preferably undyed and unbleached) around the affected body parts, then thoroughly soak the towel with the cooled solution. This prevents the animal from lick- ing off the solution and enables you to keep the solution on your com- panion animal for several hours. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 289 First make a decoction of the juniper or the uva ursi leaves. Strain the cooled fluid through a sieve. Pour the liquid over your animal’s skin and coat. If your animal licks the rinse off his skin, use the rinse as a fomentation instead. Herbs for Pets 290 At the same time you are adjusting diet, treatment should begin with herbs that offer tonic support to the immune system and all organs involved in food metabolism and waste elimination. The Basic Support Formula serves as a good starting point. The animal’s entire health history should be evaluated to find clues to possible causes. Animals who have been subjected to prolonged antibiotic therapies may respond well to immune- modulating herbs such as astragalus or echinacea. To relieve itching and inflammation on the surface of the body, herbs with astrin- gent and wound-healing properties are indicated. In dogs or cats with itchy skin that exhibits little or no change of appear- ance, a liberal application of oatmeal may be applied to affected areas—cook the oatmeal into a loose, wet consistency and allow it to cool before putting it on your animal. A peppermint or lavender skin rinse is another option to help relieve itch- ing. If the itching is associated with minor redness, a daily skin rinse of cooled chamomile, plantain, or calendula tea may bring relief. Completely soak the ani- mal with the tea and allow him to drip dry. If open scratches, scabs, or sores are visi- ble, try combining calendula and comfrey, with sage, bee balm, thyme, or yarrow tea in equal proportions. When cooled and used in a rinse, this mixture accelerates the healing process and helps inhibit bacterial infection. If your companion’s condition is severe—the skin is flaky and red and scratching or chewing is continuous— stronger astringents may be needed. A decoction of uva ursi, juniper leaf, or rose bark are strong astringents that should serve well here. When using strong astringents on animals, proceed with caution. Dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, and other small creatures have skin that is often quite sensitive. Before soaking your animal with a fluid that is intended to tighten the skin, test it first—put a small amount on a portion of the animal’s body to make sure that there will not be any adverse reaction. One example of a basic astringent skin rinse can be found in the box on page 288. Birds have especially tender skin, and rinses consisting of strong astringents should be avoided in most cases. Sage, ECHINACEA AND OREGON GRAPE CLAY POULTICE Combine the following: 4 oz green or bentonite clay (powder)* 1⁄2 oz echinacea tincture (alcohol based) 1⁄2 oz Oregon grape tincture (alcohol based) *Be sure to use only supplement- grade clay (available at health food stores) Thoroughly combine the three ingredients, adding just enough dis- tilled water to make a thick paste. Then apply the poultice to the affected areas and leave it on to dry, if possible. If licking, rolling, scratch- ing, or other attempts at removal are a problem, wrap the area with a cloth or a piece of gauze. Leftover poultice can be put into an airtight container and stored in the refriger- ator almost indefinitely. If it dries out, just add more water or tincture to soften it. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 291 bee balm, or peppermint tea often work well in a birdbath. (Sage may help elimi- nate mites as well as relieve itching.) Add a dilute concentration of the tea to a bowl of clean, chlorine-free water (just enough to tint the water) and place it in the cage. Most birds enjoy taking an occasional bath, especially if they’re itchy! If an established bacterial infection is evident (an area is swollen and red, and sores are discharging pus), internal doses of echinacea tincture can be coupled with external applications of echinacea and Oregon grape (or organically farmed goldenseal) powder, tincture, salve, or ointment at the sites of infection. This boosts immune system response to the infection while adding direct antibacterial intervention. Another effective option for treating isolated infections of the skin is an echinacea and Oregon grape clay poul- tice, which is discussed in detail below. In cases in which itching and inflam- mation are severe, internal doses of licorice may bring relief by boosting pro- duction of corticosteroids in the body and lending direct anti-inflammatory activities to the effort. But licorice may not be a good choice in chronic, perhaps inherited skin disorders that require continuous long-term treatment because of its possi- ble side effects. In these cases, herbal treatment is limited to nutritional support and topical relief measures. If the animal has a fever, a good possi- bility exists that the infection has moved into the body, meaning it’s time to call your veterinarian immediately. PYODERMA The term pyoderma refers to infections of the skin that are characterized by the presence of subsurface pus. Most often, pyoderma is caused by foreign bodies such as splinters, insect bites or stings, fleas, or mites that have entered the skin and caused infection. In these cases, basic first aid or antiparasitic measures usually solve the problem. But in cases where pyoderma is secondary to systemic disease or dysfunction, its presence may indicate a serious, even life-threatening, condition. The possible causes range from a minor nutritional deficiency or allergy to inherited or acquired metabolic dysfunc- tions, autoimmune disease or deficiency (including lupus, pemphigus, vasculitis), viral infection (including FeLV and FIV), hormonal imbalances, parasitic infections, long-term steroid therapies, and even can- cer. The potential seriousness of pyoder- ma-related illnesses is testament to the value and importance of requiring a full holistic examination of your companion, his diet, and his environment. Diet and nutrition, as you may have guessed, are the first factors to consider in treating any pyoderma-related disor- der of internal origin. Herbal therapies should start with tonic support. The Basic Support Formula (see page 287) offers a good start. In severe cases, perhaps where acnelike pustules erupt on the chin of a cat and begin to spread to other parts of the body, a safe but aggressive systemic detoxification therapy might be indicated. This might include diuretic herbs such as dandelion leaf; liver stimu- lants such as yellow dock, Oregon grape, and turmeric; and blood-cleansing alter- natives such as red clover and alfalfa. Liver-regenerating herbs such as milk thistle and licorice may be useful as well, especially in cases in which chemical- induced liver damage is a suspected cause. Marshmallow root may help to ease the movement of waste through the colon. Psyllium husks added to the ani- mal’s food as per the supplement manu- facturer’s directions may also assist with the passing of waste. In addition to supporting the liver, kidneys, and digestive system, it’s impor- tant to thoroughly evaluate and support Herbs for Pets 292 the animal’s immune system. Clinical blood and urine tests may be useful here, as will the experience of a holistic veteri- narian. If a determination is made that the immune system needs stimulation, echinacea or astragalus may prove bene- ficial. If immune deficiency is compound- ed by viral infection, liver damage, or inflammation, licorice may serve as a use- ful adjunct. It’s important to note, howev- er, that immune system stimulation may not always be a good idea in the treat- ment of autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system is working against itself, such as with lupus erythe- matosus. Again, you are advised to con- sult your veterinarian before proceeding. External discomforts can be relieved with the same astringent and anti-inflam- matory herbs that are used for seborrhea. Aloe gel or a plantain or chickweed poul- tice may bring soothing relief as well. For cases in which pyoderma is limited to just a few isolated areas of the body, an herb- clay poultice can be especially effective at relieving itching, inhibiting bacteria and fungi, and pulling infection toward the surface of the body. When applied to the skin, the green or bentonite clay used for the poultice (or paste) naturally pulls fluid and waste products toward itself, while lending its own itch-relieving astringent activities and a diversity of mineral nutri- ents to the skin. As pathogenic microbes are drawn toward the clay, they are con- fronted with antimicrobial herb con- stituents that inhibit their reproduction. This clay poultice is an excellent first aid remedy for venomous and nonven- omous bites and stings as well. Be aware that the bentonite clay sold at hardware and feed stores often contains harmful bacteria and other impurities. Alcohol tinctures are preferable to glycerin because they add astringency to the for- mula and serve as preservatives in a poul- tice that is saved for future use. CONTACT DERMATITIS Contact dermatitis is caused when an irritating substance, organism, or aller- gen contacts or damages the outer sur- face of the skin. The onset of symptoms can be immediate or delayed for hours or even days. Contact dermatitis can appear in many forms—from what appears to be a hot, pink-flushed spot of skin to raised wheals, blisters, and ulcers that cover the animal’s body. In dogs and cats, the most common form of contact dermatitis occurs as the result of fleabites. Treatment in these cases begins with examining why the animal is so hypersensitive to the bites and then continues by working to make the environments of these pesky critters less hospitable. Symptomatic relief can be provided by applying astringent skin rinses (see “Seborrhea”). A skin rinse of grindelia is considered a specific remedy for dermati- tis caused by contact with poison ivy or poison oak. Jewelweed (Impatiens capen- sis), a plant native to eastern and central North America, has also been long regarded as a remedy for poison ivy. The tea of this herb is taken internally by humans, but its safety and effectiveness in animals are unknown. Alterative and diuretic herbs such as burdock root and dandelion leaf may be fed in tea or whole form to help the body eliminate anti- genic compounds that may be contribut- ing to the itch and inflammation. SEBACEOUS CYSTS Sebaceous cysts are lesions involving the ducts leading from sebaceous glands to their associated hair follicles. They are generally caused by obstruction of the ducts and appear as semisolid, freely moving lumps beneath the skin. A natural raw food diet is the best pre- vention. If an animal does get a seba- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 293 A SYSTEMIC DETOXIFYING FORMULA FOR DOGS, CATS, HORSES, AND GOATS Combine the following: 2 parts dandelion leaf 2 parts yellow dock root 2 parts red clover 1 part licorice root 2 parts marshmallow For dogs and cats, a glycerin-based tincture is the best form of application for this detoxifying formula. Yellow dock is bitter, and the sweet flavor of vegetable glyc- erin aids in administration. Feeding about 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) of the com- bined tincture twice daily for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight is usual- ly sufficient to stimulate elimination. For best results, feed the tincture directly into the animal’s mouth. If this isn’t possible, try diluting the tincture with water. As a last resort, add it to the animal’s food. This formula should not be used continuous- ly for more than seven days. Horses, goats, sheep, llamas, and other large herbivores can be fed this formu- la in fresh or dried, whole-herb form—if they’ll eat it. Horses will probably need 3–6 cups of the herbs each day, whereas goats, sheep, and llamas may need only 11⁄2–3 cups. If direct feeding is not possible, try feeding everything but the yellow dock, then administer this bitter herb later in the form of tincture (prorate the tincture’s dosage to the amount the animal would receive in the formula). The idea behind this detoxifying formula is to stimulate gentle elimination of waste from the liver and digestive organs, not to drain your animal. If vomiting occurs, discontinue use immediately. Stools should be soft but not watery and gushing on passage. Likewise, the animal should not show any signs of gastric dis- comfort such as griping, distention, or odd sounds coming from the stomach. If this occurs, reduce the dose by one-half or discontinue use—the digestive system is stimulated enough and a different approach is warranted. On the other hand, if your animal has been constipated and is not finding relief from this formula, then the dosage can be increased in increments of 10 percent per feeding until stools appear soft or until the equivalent of one and one-half times the original dose is reached. After that, if results are not seen within two days, discontinue use—this formula is probably not going to work for your animal. This detoxifying formula should not be given continuously for more than ten days without the supervision of a qualified practitioner. It should not be used in pregnant animals or in those with a history of urinary stones or preexisting kidney disease. All of this is because of the oxalic acid contained in yellow dock. When used over a long period of time, oxalic acid can be irritating to the urinary system, and it may contribute to the formation of kidney or bladder stones. Herbs for Pets 294 ceous cyst, administering some herbs that help the body eliminate more easily might be in order. Herbs that assist lym- phatic drainage, such as cleavers, red clover, calendula, and burdock may help. Urinary Problems You may notice that your companion is drinking more and urinating less, urinat- ing in unusual places, or straining while urinating. Blood or other discharge may be visible in the urine, redness and inflammation may be evident at or around the animal’s urethra, or urine may be dark or especially odorous. If dis- comfort is evident when the lower abdomen or the area immediately behind the rib cage is gently palpated with fingertips, your companion may have an infection or inflammation of the bladder or kidneys. While these are all physical signs of a urinary tract disorder, holistic care of an animal’s urinary system requires a level of attentiveness beyond mere recognition of such symptoms. The urinary system is a delicately bal- anced arrangement of organs and body chemistries that serve a critical purpose of eliminating potentially toxic com- pounds from the body. The elimination process begins with the kidneys, which are responsible for separating waste material from the blood and delivering it via the ureters to the bladder. The blad- der then holds the urine until it is released from the body via the urethra. This system sounds simple but is actually complex when we consider the special nutritive, chemical, and structural requirements of the individual organs. The kidneys are fragile, oxygen-depend- ent organs with a low tolerance to stress. They work in concert with the digestive tract, liver, and circulatory system, and they are easily damaged if the relation- ships between these systems become compromised. For instance, if the liver is deficient in its job of removing dietary and systemic waste via the digestive tract, the kidneys and urinary tract suffer from the stress of handling waste prod- ucts that they are not designed to han- dle. The result can be kidney failure, stones, inflammation, or infection. Adding to the holistic complexity of this system is the fact that it is largely made up of smooth-muscle structures, unique vascular arrangements, and mucous membranes that require a special diversi- ty of nutrients and precise chemical bal- ances to remain healthy and functional. The most effective way to treat or pre- vent urinary system illness is to recognize your animal’s needs before physical symptoms of disease are obvious. Sometimes our companions have strange ways of telling us that they don’t feel well. They may start spraying the wall or our favorite clothes. Such behavior may be related to an emotional problem, but it may also mean that our friends are try- ing to tell us that something is seriously wrong physically. Don’t ignore or write off sudden bad behavior as neurosis—the situation could be quite serious. Effective holistic treatment of uri- nary disease starts with a critical assessment of the animal’s diet. Usually infection, stones, or kidney fail- ure is the progressive result of a nutri- tional excess, deficiency, or metabolic imbalance. It’s well known among clini- cians and researchers that animals who receive a balanced natural diet seldom suf- fer from urinary system ailments. When using herbs to treat urinary problems, teas and tinctures are the best forms of preparation. The goal is to get the active constituents of a plant into the urine, and the best way to do this is to bypass as much of the diges- tive system as possible with a liquid solution fed on an empty stomach. Following are some of the more com- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 295 mon treatments for urinary ailments we face as animal caregivers. BLADDER AND KIDNEY STONES (UROLITHIASIS) Like most forms of urinary disease, stones (sometimes called gravel or crystals) are the by-products of metabolic dysfunction or poor diet. They are associated with the body’s inability to effectively metabolize calcium, magnesium, ammonium, or other minerals. Many of the minerals that form stones are essential nutrients in a balanced diet, but they must be received by a healthy balanced body in a readily usable form. It’s important to know that excess minerals that the body cannot use must be eliminated through the digestive and urinary tracts. Stones are formed when urine pH levels or other chemical factors cause the minerals to bind and form crystals, which in turn build upon each other to create solid structures known as uroliths. Uroliths are most likely to occur in the bladder, but they sometimes form in the kidneys. Exposure to cadmium is also known to increase the formation of stones. The most common source of cadmium exposure for animals is ciga- rette smoke. To remain clean and free of harmful bacteria, the urinary tract must continu- ally flush itself. If an animal’s urethra is blocked by one or more uroliths, uremia, a potentially life-threatening condition, can result. If a ureter is blocked, kidney damage may occur and progress quickly after the onset of symptoms. Even if the animal’s condition appears stable and nonprogressive, urolithiasis creates an environment in the urinary system in which impeded waste elimination may lead to infectious growth of harmful bac- teria and fungi. Urolithiasis is especially common in cats, but dogs and other ani- mals may suffer from stones as well. Balanced nutrition is paramount in the effective treatment and prevention of uri- nary stones. A positive change in diet often equates to a long-term cure. Many types of urinary stones dissolve when urine chem- istry is corrected through a change of diet. However, some types of stones such as cal- cium oxalate uroliths must either be elimi- nated through the urethra via urination (an often long and painful process) or be sur- gically removed (depending on the size and number of the stones). The holistic herbal approach toward urinary system infection or stones must always start with a thorough dietary eval- uation. After that, the primary objectives are to assist the body in eliminating the stones, to help moderate urine pH (which is normally slightly acidic) with diuretic and demulcent herbs, and to inhibit infection and reduce the painful inflammation that makes urination diffi- cult by treating with with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory herbs. Marshmallow has many qualities that make it a first-choice herb for treat- ing kidney and bladder stones. Herbs for Pets 296 In all cases (whether the stones are in the kidneys or the bladder), our approach begins with a thick, alcohol- free liquid preparation of marshmallow. The slippery oily mucilage of a cooled marshmallow tea or glycerite provides a protective lubricating barrier on swollen mucous membranes, thus assisting with the passage of stones. Marshmallow also has mild astringent qualities and antimi- crobial properties that join to reduce inflammation and help inhibit bacterial growth in the healing process. Plantain serves similar purposes but is less mucilaginous than marshmallow and has a slightly higher astringency. This makes it appropriate in cases in which the ure- thral inflammation from the passage of gravel is causing pain and strain during urination. Gravel root is another tradi- tional option worth considering. In cases in which minor urinary bleed- ing is present and bladder or kidney inflammation persists, couch grass and corn silk serve as good anti-inflammato- ries. If significant bleeding is occurring in the bladder but clinical evaluation has determined that kidney function remains strong and kidney inflammation is not evident, stronger hemostatic and astrin- gent herbs such as horsetail, uva ursi, and yarrow can be added to marshmallow to help stop the hemorrhage. If the kidneys are inflamed, however, these herbs may be contraindicated, and couch grass or shepherd’s purse make better options. Diuretic herbs such as dandelion leaf and cleavers are indicated in cases in which urination has not been severely obstructed because they help to dilute the urine and assist the body in its efforts to flush stones and bacteria out of the urinary tract. Keep in mind that if urina- tion is obstructed, strong diuretics may compound the situation because the increased urine volume may cause added pressure upon the kidneys. If urine backs up into the kidneys, a life-threatening infection can result. See your veterinarian immediately. Antimicrobial herbs should be used as a preventive measure against infection, especially in circumstances in which uri- nation is inhibited. Echinacea serves this purpose well. Oregon grape or certified organic goldenseal is useful for fighting bacteria and serve as effective anti- inflammatory agents in the bladder as well. If overly acidic urine is part of the problem, mullein leaf tea may help bring pH levels back toward normal. Mullein leaf also has diuretic and antimicrobial properties. URINARY SYSTEM INFECTIONS (CYSTITIS) Bacterial infection of the urinary tract is the most common infectious disease of dogs. At least 10 percent of all dogs seen by veterinarians for any reason have a uri- nary tract infection. Symptoms may include fever, lethargy, backache, painful urination (dysuria), frequent urination, and blood in the urine (hematuria). Causes are varied, but from a holistic per- spective the underlying question is always the same: Why was the animal’s body unable to effectively ward off the infection in the first place? In many cases, this question leads us back to diet, but other causes include immunological deficiency or bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infection from bad water or food. Bladder stones, injury, or tumors may also be contributing factors. In all cases, the focus of symptomatic herbal treatment is fundamentally the same—to assist the body at repelling the infection-causing entities, relieve inflam- mation and discomfort, dilute urine, and encourage urination. Urinary tract infections may be caused by various forms of bacteria, fungi, or parasites that have entered the body An Herbal Repertory for Animals 297 through the mouth or urethra. Feline lower urinary tract disease, or FLUTD (formerly known as feline urinary syn- drome, or FUS), is a nonspecific inflam- matory problem that occurs in the blad- der and urethra of cats. It is a chronic form of cystitis characterized by high pH (excessively alkaline) urine. Tiny, sharp- edged, struvite crystals form in the lower urinary tract and adhere to the walls of the bladder and urethra, causing inflam- mation and blockage. If left unchecked, they can develop into larger stones and cause severe and obstructive inflammato- ry disease of the entire urinary system. A cat with FLUTD has an urge to urinate frequently, but because urine output is greatly diminished by inflammation and accumulated crystals, he may be able to force out only a few drops at a time. This is a very dangerous situation—if urine backs up in the ureters and into the kid- neys, irreversible kidney damage can result quickly. Diet must be closely scrutinized as a primary cause of FLUTD. Because cats are carnivores, they should receive a large part of their daily water intake in the form of juicy raw meat. The process of metabolizing raw meat is essential to the maintenance of healthy feline urine pH levels. When cats must subsist on a dry- food diet, their systems must perform metabolic tasks that are beyond their natural design. Urine pH levels may become severely imbalanced, setting the stage for stone formation and bacterial reproduction. In fact, studies conducted at Cornell University strongly suggest that free-feeding dry foods may predis- pose cats to FUS. We along with a large percentage of veterinarians agree. Also, setting mealtimes is better than free- feeding. A cat or dog who is able to snack and nibble all day long is more like- ly to get a urinary infection, especially if the food is out of a bag or can. The best advice for preventing FLUTD is this: If for whatever reason you cannot feed a raw food diet to your cat, avoid dry kibble and feed a premium-quality, all-natural canned food to prevent your cat from developing urinary problems. If your feline friend is already suffering from FLUTD, adjust or change his diet and take him to a vet to determine whether his kidneys have been compromised. If they haven’t, the problem can be sympto- matically approached as a case of cystitis with astringent anti-inflammatory herbs such as uva ursi or pipsissewa combined with the soothing mucilaginous proper- ties of marshmallow and the disinfectant qualities of echinacea, garlic, Oregon grape, or yarrow. If kidney involvement is evident, herbs with high concentrations of tannins or strong volatile oils should be avoided. In such cases, corn silk, couch grass, plantain, nettle, shepherd’s purse, or raspberry leaf serves as a safer astringent. Some people and animals find relief from cystitis with cranberry juice or cran- berry powder (emptied from capsules) mixed in their food. Cranberry helps keep bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urethra and bladder. But research has found that cranberry juice is effective only at preventing bladder infections, not curing them. In one study, drinking 4–6 ounces of a commercial cranberry juice daily significantly prevented infections in a nursing home population. Another study used doses ranging from 5 to 20 ounces a day (in humans), so for dogs or cats, an ounce or so of cranberry juice or 1⁄4 teaspoon of the powder should serve as a nutritious, vitamin C–rich preventive measure against infection. The symptomatic herbal approach to any form of urinary system infection cen- ters on the use of herbs that directly inhibit reproduction of the invading microbes. In most cases, Oregon grape, Herbs for Pets 298 uva ursi, garlic, raspberry leaf, or echi- nacea serves this purpose well. But always look at the whole health picture and never stop asking yourself why the infection occurred in the first place. For example, animals with chronic gingivitis sometimes develop serious kidney infec- tions as a progressive result of a bacterial imbalance that originated from poor dental health or immune system deficien- cy. Again we are brought back to diet. In carnivores, raw bones serve to keep the teeth clean and the gums healthy; in her- bivores, it’s raw, fiber-rich vegetables. The point is this: if your companion is suf- fering from a urinary infection, don’t expect to find a long-term solution exclu- sively through the use of herbs. A holistic caregiver must look deeper than the symptoms to find and eliminate the root causes of disease. See the box on this page for a useful preparation for urinary system infection and stones. KIDNEY FAILURE Given the fragility of the kidneys and the extraordinary amount of hard work they do, it’s easy to understand why they are often the first body structures to wear out in the later years of an animal’s life. However, an alarming percentage of young and middle-aged animals suc- cumb to kidney failure as well. Kidney failure is often caused and is always compounded by a poor-quality or unbalanced diet. One contributing factor is the overabundance of phosphorus in many commercial brands of dog and cat food. Some brands contain five to nine times the required amount. While excess phosphorus is seldom an issue for ani- mals with strong, healthy kidneys, it can be problematic to animals with preexist- ing kidney damage, especially if they are receiving a diet that does not contain a necessary balance of readily usable calci- A BASIC FORMULA FOR URINARY INFECTIONS AND STONES* Make a strong tea or combine low- alcohol tinctures of the following ingredients. If possible, administer the formula on an empty stomach, and encourage your companion to drink plenty of water. 3 parts marshmallow root 1 part couch grass 1 part nettle 1 part echinacea 1 part Oregon grape *This formula helps to soothe, lubricate, and reduce inflamma- tion of urinary tract tissues, thus helping with the elimination of stones. The echinacea and Oregon grape help to reduce or prevent infection. For dogs, feed 1 teaspoon (5 milli- liters) of the cooled tea, twice daily, for each 30 pounds of body weight. Or feed 1–2 milliliters of the low-alcohol combination tinc- ture twice daily. For cats, feed 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of the cooled tea, twice daily, for each 30 pounds of body weight. Or feed 0.5–1 milliliter of the low-alcohol tincture twice daily. Horses and other large animals can be given 200 milliliters of the cooled tea, fed twice daily with a turkey baster or similar device. Or you can give 20–30 milliliters of the low-alcohol tincture twice daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 299 um. In these cases, the kidneys may not be able to effectively eliminate the phos- phorus, which then accumulates in the kidneys and results in the eventual forma- tion of stones or degeneration of kidney tissues. A variety of other problems, such as diabetes, immune system dysfunction, long-term drug therapies, vaccinosis, chronic liver disease, and digestive prob- lems, often develop as the kidney dam- age progresses. The worst part of this grim picture is that the entire degenera- tive process can remain undetected until the damage has progressed into an irre- versible state of disease. Pinpointing the exact causes of kid- ney failure can be difficult. The kidneys are fragile and slow to heal, and in cases of progressive kidney degenera- tion, time is of the essence. Therefore, holistic treatment of kidney failure must begin with preventive dietary measures. If it’s too late for preventive measures, the problem is best approached as early as possible. If your companion is urinating exces- sively, drinking a lot of water, or has suf- fered from one or more urinary tract infec- tions or a bout with stones, take him to a holistic veterinarian for a thorough exami- nation. If kidney damage is found, chances are your companion will be placed on a reduced-protein, natural-food diet that is designed to moderate urine pH levels. This helps alleviate some of the kidney’s work- load, allowing the body to direct more energy toward the healing process. Herbal therapy can then commence with tonic herbs that improve renal blood circulation (ginkgo, hawthorn), reduce inflammation of nephritic (kidney) and other urinary tract tissues (couch grass, marshmallow, corn silk), and gently increase urine output (nettle, dandelion, alfalfa, goldenrod). If infection is part of the problem, nonirritat- ing antimicrobials (Oregon grape, gold- enseal) can be added as well. But extra care must be taken to assure that the herbal therapy does not further irritate the animal’s condition. Avoid herbs that con- tain large amounts of aromatic volatile oils (juniper, yarrow, members of the mint family) and those with considerable amounts of tannins (uva ursi, white oak bark, black walnut hulls), especially if the kidneys are inflamed. Most traditional herbal approaches to kidney failure are centered on increasing A BASIC HERB FORMULA FOR EARLY STAGES OF KIDNEY FAILURE Combine the tea or low-alcohol tinctures of the following: 1 part hawthorn 1 part ginkgo 1 part echinacea 1 part marshmallow 1 part dandelion leaf For dogs, a good starting dose is 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of the cooled tea or 1 milliliter of the com- bined tincture per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily, preferably given between meals and with plenty of drinking water. For cats, start with 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of the cooled tea or 1 milliliter of the combined tincture, twice daily, preferably given between meals and with plenty of drinking water. Horses and large herbivores can receive 25 milliliters of the combined tincture diluted in 8 ounces (240 milliliters) or more of water, twice daily, preferably between meals. Herbs for Pets 300 diuresis (urine output) and decreasing inflammation. But we have found better success when equal attention is placed on improving blood circulation in the kidneys. A Holistic Herbal Approach to Kidney Failure: The Tilford Theory The fact that the kidneys are second only to the brain in terms of circulatory dependency is often overlooked when treating kidney failure. If the blood flow to the kidneys is blocked by damaged or inflamed tissue, the kidneys will die from lack of oxygen. We have received several reports from veterinarians and pet owners who have seen promising results in the treatment of early to midstage kidney failure in dogs and cats from use of a formula that combines anti-inflammatory, immunos- timulant, and, most important, circulato- ry tonic herbs. The theory behind this approach is that the kidneys are critically oxygen dependent and made up of hun- dreds of blood vessels. They are sensitive to blood-pressure disorders, vascular atony, and poor circulation. Through the use of hawthorn, increased renal circula- tion is achieved without elevating blood pressure. At the same time, ginkgo dilates and improves tonicity of nephritic blood vessels, improves blood return from the extremities, and helps reduce blood pressure in congested tissues. The mucilage content of ginkgo also serves to reduce inflammation throughout the uri- nary tract and provides a protective lubri- cating barrier for the passage of wastes. A small amount of garlic or echinacea helps keep bacteria and fungi in check, marsh- mallow helps soothe and reduce inflam- mation, and dandelion leaf or the fresh juice of parsley helps to increase urine output. Other herbs worth investigating in cases of kidney failure include alfalfa, astragalus, goldenrod, and couch grass. URINARY INCONTINENCE Urinary incontinence is fairly common in aging animals, spayed females (especially dogs), and in females who have lost blad- der tone as a result of multiple pregnan- cies. Urinary incontinence can also be triggered by nervous system dysfunction, emotional disorders, inflammatory dis- ease, or nutritional deficiency. Identifying the exact cause of urinary incontinence can be challenging, and successful herbal treatment usually depends on just how well the caregiver knows and understands his or her com- panion. Did the problem begin suddenly, or has there been an occasional drop or two of urine in your companion’s bed from time to time in the past? If the lat- ter is true, a gradual degeneration of bladder tone could have been reversed early on. Does your animal appear to be stiff after exercise, do her hind legs wob- ble when she stands after exercise, or A TONIC FORMULA FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE Combine the following: 1 part oatstraw 1 part plantain 1 part corn silk 1 part nettle root or saw palmetto 1 part horsetail We like to use this formula in the form of a glycerin tincture because it’s easy to administer, but a tea is equally effective. A good starting dose is 12–20 drops of the glycerite or 1 teaspoon of the strong tea for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 301 does she seem to be holding her rump lower when walking? If any of these are even slightly evident, then your compan- ion may be developing arthritis, hip dys- plasia, or some other cause of nerve impairment that may be affecting the tone and function of urinary tract mus- cles. This illustrates just how important a pet care diary can be. By keeping detailed notes about subtle changes in your animal’s appearance, behavior, feeding habits, and physical perform- ance, you can detect trends that point to early stages of disease and that greatly simplify finding curative solutions. In spayed females, normal hormone production is interrupted when the uterus and ovaries are removed during an ovariohysterectomy. The bladder is composed of smooth-muscle groups that are functionally interdependent with a balance of reproductive hormones, so when hormone production is altered, the bladder loses tone and urine dribble results. Reversing this kind of inconti- nence is difficult because there is no way that herbs can replace hormones that should be naturally produced by the body. Oatstraw and wild yam (Dioscorea villosa) contain estrogenic (phytoestro- gens) compounds. Theoretically, these herbs might help stimulate whatever hor- mone production is left intact, and to some extent they might mimic natural hormone production enough to serve as a partial remedy for incontinence. Although these herbs are safe in moder- ate doses, this approach is unreliable and may affect only certain animals. The bet- ter approach toward hormone-related urinary incontinence applies to all forms of urinary incontinence: strengthen and support the structure and function of the bladder sphincters and urinary smooth- muscle tissues with long-term use of tonic herbs. Choices include corn silk, raspberry leaf, horsetail, saw palmetto, nettle root, couch grass, uva ursi, agri- mony, marshmallow, and plantain. Oatstraw can also be included for the aforementioned purpose and as a nutri- tive diuretic. Urinary incontinence is sometimes caused by neurological disorders, espe- cially in older animals who suffer from senility and general debility. Oftentimes, epileptic animals have a problem with incontinence too. In these cases, we can look toward cerebrotonics such as ginkgo and gotu kola to help bring relief. These herbs work to improve synaptic (nerve impulse) transmission and blood circula- tion in the brain. Skullcap or valerian might help moderate brain activities that are believed to trigger epileptic episodes and may also be instrumental in treating incontinence of neurological origin. If emotional or behavioral disorders are part of the problem, Saint-John’s-wort might be indicated. 302 ——— A ——— abortifacient: a substance that can cause abortion acupoints: part of traditional Chinese medi- cine; points on the body that are sights where pressure is applied as in acupressure or needles are inserted under the skin as in acupuncture adaptogen: a nontoxic substance that is believed to increase stamina and overall energy levels in the body, especially in stressful conditions aerial parts: the aboveground portions of a plant allopathy (see homeopathy): the use of drugs or other means to antidote a disease or symptom in a manner not necessarily coopera- tive with the body’s natural functions. alterative: an herb or other agent that gradual- ly alters an existing condition in the body.

Homeopathic remedies are composed of organic or nonorganic com- pounds that are diluted from their original strength hundreds or even thousands of times. The goal of homeopathic medicine is to effect a desired physical or psychological response by stimulating body systems at very low, perhaps even molecular levels. Often, a “like versus like” approach is employed, such as when the homeo- pathic remedy Arsenicum, an extremely dilute preparation of arsenic, is used to counter a dis- ease that produces symptoms similar to those of arsenic poisoning. homeostasis: a maintained state of health in which all checks and balances between interde- pendent elements of mind, body, and spirit are functioning harmoniously hybridize: to genetically alter a plant species in such a way that inhibits or eliminates the plant’s abilities to reproduce by natural means hydroquinones: reduced form of quinone, containing two hydroxyl groups (sometimes used as an antioxidant) hyperlipidemia: elevated concentrations of lipids in plasma; elevated blood fats hyperthyroidism: overactive functioning of the thyroid gland hypothyroidism: depressed thyroid function hypotension: low blood pressure hypotensive: capable of reducing blood pressure ——— I ——— immune modulator: an herb that acts to help the immune system by optimizing it’s ability to adjust to stressful circumstances.

L'organisme des animaux atteints de diarrhée perd de l'eau et du sel. Ces animaux s'affaiblissent, ils maigrissent et peuvent mourir. La diarrhée est fréquente chez les jeunes animaux et en tue beaucoup. La constipation se manifeste quand l'animal ne peut pas déféquer ou ne le fait que difficilement. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Comment reconnaître la diarrhée et la constipation.2 Ce qui cause la diarrhée et la constipation.3 Ce qui caractérise la diarrhée chez les différents animaux.4 Comment traiter et combattre la diarrhée.5 Comment traiter la constipation. Comment reconnaître la diarrhée Les animaux souffrant de diarrhée évacuent des selles liquides (excréments) plusieurs fois par jour. Les selles sont liquides, elles dégagent une mauvaise odeur et leur couleur n'est pas normale. A cause du sang qu'elles contiennent, elles peuvent être vert foncé, brun foncé ou d'un noir rougeâtre. Dans certains cas, par exemple chez l'animal atteint de peste bovine, la diarrhée dégage une odeur nauséabonde. Les causes de diarrhée La diarrhée peut durer un ou deux jours puis cesser. Ce type de diarrhée a les origines suivantes: · L'animal n'a pas reçu le fourrage qui lui convient. · Le fourrage de l'animal a été brusquement modifié. · La distribution d'ensilage peut parfois causer la diarrhée. · Le fourrage était vieux, il pourrissait ou fermentait. · La diarrhée peut être due à des germes (la température du corps peut atteindre un niveau élevé). · L'infection due à des parasites peut causer une diarrhée qui contient parfois du sang. La diarrhée chez les ruminants Chez les bovins, les ovins, les caprins et les buffles, la diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Germes et parasites internes, surtout chez les jeunes animaux au pâturage. · Germes infectant les intestins des jeunes animaux (la température du corps n'est généralement pas élevée). · Suralimentation des veaux avec du lait en poudre de mauvaise qualité. Si les bovins ont à la fois la diarrhée et des lésions (anormales) de la bouche, vous devez demander conseil à votre vétérinaire. Chez les ovins et les caprins, la diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Infection par un germe (la température du corps peut atteindre un niveau élevé).· Présence de parasites internes chez les jeunes animaux au pâturage. Les jeunes animaux peuvent avoir la diarrhée après le sevrage. La diarrhée chez les chevaux La diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Infection par les germes (la température du corps est généralement élevée).· Antibiotiques ou médicaments administrés pour combattre une autre maladie.· Stress (l'animal est élevé dans de mauvaises conditions et perturbé).· Un poulain âgé d'une semaine peut avoir la diarrhée quand sa mère est en chaleur (œstrus). La diarrhée chez les porcs · La diarrhée chez le porc peut être causée par une infection due à des germes (la température du corps peut atteindre un niveau élevé) ou à des parasites internes. La diarrhée chez les chameaux La diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · De trop grandes quantités de fourrage vert frais peuvent provoquer une diarrhée verte. · L'infection par des parasites peut provoquer une diarrhée d'un brun foncé ou d'un rouge foncé. · Les chameaux mâles en rut peuvent avoir la diarrhée. La diarrhée chez les poulets et les canards · La diarrhée blanche des poulets est causée par un germe (une bactérie) qui est transmis par la poule au poussin. Chez les volailles adultes, cette maladie provoque une diarrhée d'un brun verdâtre, mais chez le poussin la diarrhée est de couleur blanche. · La diarrhée contenant du sang peut être provoquée par les petits parasites appelés coccidies (voir module 55) qui infectent l'intestin. La diarrhée chez les lapins Les crottes de lapin doivent être distinctes les unes des autres, rondes, assez fermes et d'un brun grisâtre. Tout changement est un signe de mauvaise santé. La diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Remplacement d'un fourrage sec par un fourrage vert. · Nourriture défectueuse: trop humide, trop froide ou contaminée par des produits chimiques. · Maladie causée par des germes (la température du corps est généralement élevée). · Coccidies (elles peuvent causer la diarrhée chez les lapereaux). Traitement La diarrhée accompagnée de fièvre est causée par des germes. Si la diarrhée persiste plus de deux jours et si la température du corps a augmenté (voir module 4), vous devez demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire. L'animal peut être traité aux antibiotiques (voir R6, R7, annexe 1) ou aux sulfamides (voir R9, annexe 1). La diarrhée entraînera chez l'animal une perte d'eau et de sels; si on la laisse persister l'animal risque de mourir. Si vous ne pouvez pas obtenir l'aide du vétérinaire, vous pouvez administrer vous-même à l'animal un liquide de réhydratation. Pour confectionner du liquide de réhydratation, vous devez mélanger six cuillerées à café de sucre et une demi-cuillerée à café de sel dans 1 litre d'eau chaude propre. Administrez ce mélange (500 ml pour les ovins ou les caprins) sous forme de breuvage quatre fois par jour pendant trois jours. Les animaux de taille plus grande ont besoin de davantage de liquide: 5 pour cent du poids corporel deux fois par jour. Traitement Constipation Les animaux constipés ne peuvent pas déféquer ou bien ils évacuent des excréments très durs avec difficulté. Il est facile de déceler un animal atteint de constipation. La constipation est traitée par un lavement. On injecte dans le rectum de l'eau savonneuse chaude. Pour soulager la constipation, on peut administrer à l'animal par la bouche du sulfate de magnésie ou des huiles vendues dans le commerce (voir R22, annexe 1). ConstipationModule 69: Salivation et problèmes de la bouche La salive est produite par des glandes dans la bouche; elle aide à mastiquer et à avaler la nourriture. Une salivation excessive, avec de l'écume autour de la bouche, n'est pas normale. Une salivation excessive accompagnée de lésions de la bouche et de fièvre est un signe de maladie. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez pouvoir: 1 Reconnaître une salivation excessive.2 Reconnaître l'étouffement (nourriture bloquée dans l'œsophage).3 Identifier les différents types de lésions de la bouche.4 Reconnaître les aphtes dans la bouche.5 Traiter les problèmes concernant la bouche. Salivation excessive Une salivation excessive accompagnée de mouvements de mastication peut avoir plusieurs causes différentes. Ouvrez la bouche de l'animal et vérifiez ce qui cause le problème, à savoir: · Des corps étrangers (épines, clous, morceaux de nourriture) dans la bouche ou entre les dents. · Des problèmes dentaires et des abcès. · Une intoxication. · Des morceaux de nourriture bloqués dans l'œsophage et provoquant un étouffement. L'étouffement (nourriture bloquée dans l'œsophage) Cela se produit quand des morceaux de fourrage secs ou de grande taille sont bloqués dans l'œsophage. Cet incident est fréquent chez les bovins et peut se produire chez les chevaux. Il faut éliminer l'obstruction. L'étouffement chez les ruminants provoque la météorisation. La meilleure façon d'éliminer l'obstruction consiste à appuyer sur l'encolure de l'animal du côté gauche vers le haut et vers la bouche. Un autre moyen consiste à appuyer fortement sur le dessus de la bouche avec vos doigts pour obliger l'animal à l'ouvrir. Versez alors une petite quantité (10-20 ml) d'huile dans la bouche de l'animal ou introduisez une sonde gastrique dans l'œsophage (voir annexe 3). Salivation accompagnée de lésions de la bouche Parfois, un animal produit une salive excessive qui s'écoule de la bouche avec de l'écume. Cela est dû à une lésion dans la bouche, ou sur la langue ou les lèvres. Les lésions de la bouche peuvent avoir les aspects suivants: · Des taches rouges et des aphtes (ampoules remplies de sérosité) sont présents dans la bouche. · La peau de détache à certains endroits, laissant visible du tissu rouge. · La langue est tuméfiée. La salivation excessive, les lésions de la bouche et la fièvre sont des signes de maladie infectieuse. Vous devez demander à votre vétérinaire d'examiner immédiatement l'animal. La peste bovine et la fièvre aphteuse (voir module 25) provoquent une salivation excessive et des lésions de la bouche. Ces signes peuvent aussi être dus à d'autres maladies. Traitez les lésions de la bouche avec un antiseptique (voir R3, annexe 1). Votre vétérinaire recommandera peut-être des injections d'antibiotiques pendant plusieurs jours.Module 70: La fièvre Quand on vérifie l'Etat de santé d'un animal, il est important de connaître la température du corps. Utilisez votre thermomètre pour prendre la température du corps si vous soupçonnez un animal d'être malade. Si la température est supérieure à la normale (voir module 4), l'animal a de la fièvre. La fièvre est l'un des signes les plus courants d'une maladie infectieuse. On appelle fièvre bénigne une légère augmentation de la température du corps et forte fièvre une augmentation importante. Quand la température du corps est inférieure à la normale, l'Etat de l'animal pourrait être dû à la faim, à une hémorragie ou à une déshydratation. Comme la diarrhée, la fièvre entraîne pour l'animal une perte de beaucoup d'eau et de sels. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Quand un animal a de la fièvre.2 Ce qui cause la fièvre.3 Ce qu'il faut faire avec un animal qui a de la fièvre. La fièvre Vous devez savoir quel est l'aspect d'un animal sain (voir module 5). Si vous soupçonnez un animal d'être en mauvaise santé, parlez à son propriétaire pour en savoir le plus possible à son sujet. Examinez l'animal et utilisez votre thermomètre pour lui prendre sa température. Si la température du corps est supérieure à la normale, l'animal a de la fièvre. L'augmentation de la température vous indiquera à quel point l'animal a de la fièvre. La température normale du corps des ovins est de 39 °C. Si la température atteint 40 °C ou 41 °C, le mouton a une fièvre légère. Si la température se situe entre 41,5 °C et 42 °C, l'animal a une forte fièvre. Une température de 38 °C est inférieure à la normale. Chez tous les animaux, une augmentation de 1 °C ou 2 °C de la température du corps indique une fièvre bénigne, tandis que toute température supérieure de 2 °C à la normale indique une forte fièvre. L'origine de la fièvre La fièvre, en particulier une forte fièvre, est le résultat d'une maladie infectieuse causée par des germes (voir module 6). Quand certains types de germes pénètrent dans l'organisme d'un animal sain, il tombe malade. Les animaux peuvent prendre des germes pour les raisons suivantes: · Présence de germes dans l'atmosphère.· Eau sale et mauvais fourrage.· Logement de l'animal sale (déjections et urine non évacuées).· Lait, salive, urine ou sang provenant d'animaux malades.· Morsures de mouches et blessures. Le traitement de la fièvre Si un animal a de la fièvre, séparez-le des autres et placez-le à l'ombre dans un endroit frais, avec beaucoup d'eau fraîche et propre. Si l'animal a une fièvre bénigne mais aucun signe de diarrhée, de constipation, d'écoulement à l'œil ou à la bouche ni aucun autre indice de mauvaise santé, il faut lui donner un peu de bon fourrage. Surveillez-le pendant un ou deux jours pour voir si la fièvre baisse. Si l'animal a une forte fièvre et de la diarrhée, un écoulement ou d'autres signes de mauvaise santé, vous ne devez lui donner que de l'eau fraîche et propre, et obtenir si possible l'aide du vétérinaire. Si vous ne pouvez pas faire venir le vétérinaire pour un animal atteint d'une forte fièvre, vous pouvez administrer un antibiotique ou un sulfamide par injection ou par voie orale pendant au moins trois jours pour tuer les germes (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1). Surveillez bien l'animal pour déceler les signes d'amélioration pendant les deux journées qui suivent. Si l'animal ne retourne pas à la normale (pour ce qui est de l'alimentation, de la boisson et du mouvement), vous devez contacter le vétérinaire pour découvrir le problème et décider du moyen de le traiter.Module 71: Toux et problèmes de respiration La toux est une expiration forte et puissante par la bouche. L'éternuement est une expiration brève et forte par les naseaux. Les difficultés de respiration et la respiration très rapide sont d'autres problèmes de l'appareil respiratoire; ils traduisent un état anormal. Les problèmes de respiration accompagnés de fièvre et d'un écoulement aux naseaux signifient que l'animal a une infection. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Quand un animal a de la toux.2 Ce qu'est l'éternuement.3 Ce qu'est un écoulement aux naseaux.4 Comment traiter les animaux qui ont des problèmes respiratoires. La toux La toux est une expiration forte et puissante (voir module 3). Elle peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Maladies infectieuses des poumons ou de la trachée. · Parasites dans les poumons. · Liquide ou mucosités dans les poumons ou la trachée. · Pénétration d'un médicament liquide (breuvage) dans les poumons au lieu d'atteindre l'estomac en passant par l'œsophage. Les porcs peuvent tousser quand ils reçoivent des aliments poussiéreux. L'éternuement Un éternuement est une expiration forte et puissante par les naseaux. Il peut être causé par une infection à l'intérieur des naseaux ou par les larves de la mouche des naseaux (voir module 64). Difficultés de respiration L'animal éprouvera de la difficulté à respirer s'il a une infection des poumons ou de la trachée. La respiration sera bruyante. Une obstruction de la trachée par un corps étranger ou un abcès causera aussi des difficultés de respiration. Respiration rapide La respiration rapide est causée par une maladie infectieuse et elle est associée à de la fièvre. On la remarque aisément en observant les mouvements du poitrail quand l'animal respire. Traitement Si un animal tousse sans qu'il y ait d'écoulement aux naseaux ou un signe de fièvre, vous devez soupçonner la présence d'un corps étranger ou de poussières dans la trachée ou les poumons, ou encore une strongylose. Vérifiez s'il n'y pas de corps étranger ou, si c'est nécessaire, donnez à l'animal un traitement pour la strongylose (voir R11, R12, annexe 1). Une toux accompagnée de fièvre et d'un écoulement aux naseaux et aux yeux est causée par une infection. Vous devez demander l'aide du vétérinaire mais, s'il n'est pas possible de l'obtenir, vous pouvez administrer à l'animal des antibiotiques ou un sulfamide (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1) pendant au moins trois jours. L'éternuement en l'absence de fièvre est causé par la présence d'un corps étranger dans les naseaux ou de larves de la mouche des naseaux. Si un animal a un corps étranger ou un abcès dans la trachée, il éprouvera des difficultés à respirer mais il n'aura pas de fièvre.Module 72: Les problèmes oculaires Une lésion ou infection de l'œil ou une carence en vitamines (avitaminose) peuvent entraîner la cécité chez les animaux. Les animaux aveugles peuvent ne pas survivre parce qu'ils seront incapables de trouver de la nourriture. Un problème dans un seul œil résulte d'un traumatisme ou de la présence d'un corps étranger. Un problème dans les deux yeux accompagné de fièvre signifie que l'animal a une infection ou une maladie grave. Si l'animal est aveugle des deux yeux mais n'a pas de fièvre, vous devez soupçonner une avitaminose, par exemple une carence en vitamine A ou B. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez connaître: 1 La structure de l'œil de l'animal.2 Les causes des problèmes oculaires.3 Le traitement des problèmes oculaires. L'œil L'œil est important pour la survie de l'animal. La surface de l'œil qui ressemble à du verre est appelée cornée. L'œil peut être recouvert par les paupières qui le protègent. L'œil Les problèmes oculaires Si un œil est rouge, gonflé et larmoyant, cela peut être causé par: · Un corps étranger comme du sable, de la poussière ou une graine dans l'œil.· Une lésion ou coupure de la cornée.· Une infection oculaire causée par des mouches ou des souillures.. Si les deux yeux sont gonflés, rouges et larmoyants, et si éventuellement l'animal est incapable d'ouvrir les yeux, c'est un signe d'infection. Vous devez vérifier la température du corps pour voir si l'animal a de la fièvre. Beaucoup de maladies provoquent des problèmes oculaires. Les animaux aveugles Il est facile de repérer un animal aveugle parce qu'il heurte des objets en marchant. Il est difficile de garder un animal aveugle. Pour vérifier si un animal est aveugle, faites avec la main un mouvement rapide et menaçant vers la face de l'animal sans toucher celui-ci ni créer du vent qu'il pourrait sentir. Si l'animal ne cligne pas des yeux, c'est généralement le signe qu'il est aveugle. La vitamine A, qui est présente dans le fourrage vert, l'ensilage et le foin de bonne qualité, est importante pour conserver une bonne vision. Si les animaux ne reçoivent que du fourrage ancien et sec ou s'ils doivent paître dans des zones arides, ils acquièrent une héméralopie et ne voient plus au crépuscule ou la nuit. Traitement Pour traiter les problèmes oculaires: · Demandez à quelqu'un d'immobiliser l'animal s'il a un corps étranger (souillure ou sable) dans l'œil. · Avec des mains propres, et en utilisant le pouce et l'index, ouvrez les paupières et pressez doucement vers l'intérieur. · Utilisez un chiffon doux et propre pour retirer le corps étranger de l'œil. · Mettez une goutte d'huile ou de la pommade dans l'œil. Traitement Si vous éprouvez de la difficulté à enlever un corps étranger: · Déposez une goutte d'huile d'olive, de ricin ou de foie de morue dans l'œil; cela aidera à retirer les souillures. · Mettez un peu de sucre dans l'œil pour provoquer des larmes; elles évacueront le corps étranger. Utilisez un collyre ou une pommade pour soigner les yeux rouges et gonflés (voir R23, annexe 1). Traitement Si vous ne parvenez pas à ouvrir un œil gonflé, ne forcez pas les paupières à s'ouvrir. Vous devez rechercher l'aide du vétérinaire. Si les deux yeux sont gonflés, rouges et larmoyants et si l'animal a de la fièvre, mettez l'animal à l'ombre, à l'écart des autres. C'est là un signe de maladie infectieuse et il faudra peut-être traiter l'animal aux antibiotiques. On évite la carence en vitamines A et B, en distribuant aux animaux de l'ensilage ou du fourrage de complément pendant la saison sèche. En cas de carence, ces vitamines peuvent aussi être administrées par injection (voir R28, annexe 1).Module 73: Plaies et hémorragies Une plaie est une coupure ou déchirure de la peau. Toutes les plaies saignent, elles sont douloureuses et peuvent être infectées par des germes ou des larves. Parfois, un animal peut saigner par suite de plaies à l'intérieur du corps, qui ont été causées par des parasites, par un accident ou, chez la femelle, par des problèmes au moment de la mise bas. C'est ce qu'on appelle une hémorragie interne. Le sang transporte l'oxygène des poumons vers chaque partie de l'organisme. Si l'organisme perd trop de sang, il n'obtient pas assez d'oxygène et l'animal en meurt. Toutes les plaies doivent être nettoyées soigneusement et il faut faire cesser le saignement. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Quelles sont les causes des plaies.2 Comment soigner les plaies au départ.3 Comment faire cesser le saignement.4 Que faire en cas d'hémorragie interne.5. Comment traiter les plaies anciennes.6 Comment soigner les blessures du cordon ombilical et les lésions dues à la castration. Comment soigner les plaies au départ Les animaux peuvent être blessés par les cornes et les morsures d'autres animaux, ou par des épines ou des objets coupants comme le verre, le fil de fer et les clous. Ces blessures seront infectées par des germes à cause des conditions dans lesquelles vivent les animaux. Si la blessure ne saigne pas trop, nettoyez-la à l'eau salée en éliminant toutes les souillures. Eliminez en les coupant les poils ou la laine qui entourent la plaie. Si vous avez un désinfectant (R1, annexe 1), mettez-en sur la plaie. Une pulvérisation pourra aussi aider à maintenir la plaie propre (R5, R8, annexe 1). Saignement (hémorragie) On peut faire cesser le saignement des plaies, petites ou superficielles, en pressant fort dessus avec un linge propre. Si le linge est trempé par le sang, placez-en un autre par-dessus plutôt que d'enlever le premier. Quand le saignement a cessé, nettoyez la plaie et traitez-la. Vous aurez besoin de l'aide du vétérinaire quand l'hémorragie provient de blessures de grande taille ou profondes. Si vous ne pouvez pas faire cesser le saignement en pressant sur la plaie avec des linges, posez un garrot (un tourniquet). Un garrot est un morceau de corde ou de toile avec lequel on serre un vaisseau sanguin. Il ne peut être utilisé que pour les blessures aux pattes ou à la queue. Il ne faut pas poser un garrot autour de l'encolure. Saignement (hémorragie) Attachez la corde autour du membre blessé, au-dessus de la plaie. Pour la serrer, glissez un bâton sous la corde et tordez jusqu'à ce que cesse le saignement. Le tourniquet ne doit pas rester posé plus de 20 minutes. Relâchez-le lentement et, si c'est nécessaire, serrez-le de nouveau. Nettoyez et traitez la plaie quand le saignement a cessé. Hémorragie due à une cassure de corne Si la corne d'un animal est brisée, essayez de faire cesser le saignement en posant sur la plaie un tampon ou un linge propre et en le maintenant en place avec un bandage. Un tourniquet provisoire à la base de la corne fera cesser l'hémorragie. Si cela ne met pas fin à l'hémorragie, on peut placer un morceau de métal chauffé à blanc directement sur l'endroit qui saigne pendant 30 secondes pour cautériser la corne et le vaisseau sanguin. Il peut s'avérer nécessaire de procéder ainsi sur plusieurs endroits qui saignent sur la corne ou encore sur la peau qui entoure la corne. Hémorragie due à une cassure de corne N'oubliez pas qu'il ne faut pas laisser un garrot posé pendant longtemps. Si l'hémorragie continue, libérez le tourniquet toutes les 20 minutes, puis resserrez-le. Hémorragie interne Ce type de saignement est dangereux. Il peut provenir: · Des poumons et de l'intestin après un accident.· De l'utérus ou du vagin après la mise bas. Les signes d'hémorragie interne sont les suivants: l'animal s'affaiblit et la respiration devient plus rapide. Un animal atteint d'une hémorragie interne doit être placé dans un endroit tranquille et chaud, et il faut lui donner de l'eau contenant une pincée de sel. N'essayez pas de faire marcher l'animal car il pourrait s'effondrer et mourir. Si vous soupçonnez un animal d'avoir une hémorragie interne, vous devez demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire. Dans bien des cas, vous ne pourrez rien faire pour arrêter l'hémorragie. Il est préférable d'abattre l'animal. Chez la jument et l'ânesse, il peut y avoir une hémorragie interne du vagin après la mise bas. Si vous ne pouvez pas obtenir l'aide du vétérinaire, placez dans le vagin un tampon constitué par un linge ou une serviette propre que vous avez fait bouillir puis laissé refroidir. Laissez la serviette dans le vagin pendant un ou deux jours puis retirez-la. Blessures anciennes Si on laisse les plaies sans traitement, elles s'infestent de larves qui aggravent le mal. Dans certains cas, la gangrène se développe dans la plaie. La blessure empire et la plaie noircit en dégageant une odeur nauséabonde. Demandez immédiatement l'aide de votre vétérinaire. Plaies dues à des opérations Les plaies peuvent être causées par des opérations pratiquées sur l'animal, à savoir: · La castration.· Le tronçonnage (la queue est écourtée).· Le décornage (ablation de la corne).· La résection du cordon ombilical immédiatement après la naissance.· Des coupures lors de la tonte de la laine. Toutes les plaies doivent être nettoyées avec un désinfectant (voir R1, annexe 1). Si vous disposez d'une poudre pour les blessures (R5, R8, annexe 1), vous devez en mettre sur la plaie tous les jours jusqu'à ce qu'elle se cicatrise. Quand les blessures ou les plaies laissées par une opération s'infectent, elles gonflent souvent à cause du pus. La tuméfaction est molle au toucher. Il faut enlever le pus de ces plaies, appelées abcès, en coupant à travers la peau avec un couteau bien aiguisé ou un scalpel pour évacuer le pus. Les abcès sont traités quotidiennement pour laisser ouverte l'incision de drainage; il faut éliminer le pus en appuyant sur la plaie, puis nettoyer celle-ci à l'eau propre ou avec un désinfectant liquide (voir R1, annexe 1). Il faut administrer un antibiotique ou un sulfamide par injection ou par voie orale pendant trois à cinq jours (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1).Module 74: Fractures (os cassés) Si un os est cassé sans plaie ni hémorragie, on dit qu'il y a une fracture fermée. Si l'os est cassé et qu'il y a saignement, on dit qu'il y a fracture ouverte. Les fractures des os chez les animaux sont difficiles à traiter, surtout chez les animaux de grande taille. On peut traiter avec succès les fractures des pattes chez les jeunes animaux de petite taille. Vous aurez besoin de l'aide du vétérinaire pour toutes les sortes de fractures. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Ce qui cause les fractures.2 Quels sont les signes de fracture.3 Comment traiter les fractures.4 Comment reconnaître le déboîtement d'un os. Causes de fracture On appelle fracture la cassure d'un os. N'importe quel os du corps peut subir une fracture, mais ce sont le plus souvent les os des pattes qui se cassent. Les fractures peuvent être dues au fait que l'animal a reçu des coups de pied, a fait une chute, a mis la patte dans un trou ou s'est battu avec un autre animal. Comment reconnaître une fracture Une fracture se produit subitement; ce n'est pas comme une maladie qui met quelque temps à se développer. Une douleur subite et une allure anormale (boiterie) sont souvent les signes d'une fracture. L'animal se refuse à utiliser la partie du corps où se trouve la fracture. Vous pouvez parfois entendre le bruit (craquement) des deux extrémités de l'os cassé quand l'animal se déplace. La zone entourant la fracture fermée sera tuméfiée. Dans une fracture ouverte, il y a une plaie et une hémorragie. On peut apercevoir les extrémités de l'os cassé à travers la plaie. Déboîtement d'articulation Il y a déboîtement d'articulation quand les extrémités de deux os (l'articulation) se séparent. Vous pouvez sentir le déboîtement à l'articulation quand vous touchez celle-ci. Déboîtement d'articulation Traitement des fractures Dans le cas d'un animal de grande taille, vous devez l'empêcher de bouger et demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire. Celui-ci décidera peut-être que l'animal doit être abattu. Les fractures des pattes sont fréquentes chez les animaux jeunes ou de petite taille. Ces fractures peuvent être traitées. Vous devrez demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire mais, s'il n'est pas possible de l'obtenir, demandez à l'agent de santé communautaire ou au rebouteux de la communauté de poser une attelle. Vous pouvez parfois remettre en place une articulation déboîtée si vous avez quelqu'un pour vous aider.Module 75: Les tumeurs sous la peau Une tumeur sous la peau peut apparaître à n'importe quel endroit du corps. Les tumeurs peuvent grossir ou cesser de se développer. Certaines tumeurs sont chaudes et douloureuses. Quelques-unes contiennent du pus (une substance jaunâtre) ou du sang. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Ce que sont les abcès.2 Comment reconnaître les abcès des ganglions lymphatiques.3 Comment traiter les abcès.4 Comment reconnaître les hématomes sous la peau.5 Ce que sont les tumeurs dures sous la peau. Abcès (tumeurs pleines de pus) L'abcès indique une infection sous la peau. On entend par abcès une tumeur sous-cutanée qui est enflée, rouge et douloureuse. Elle contient du pus. Un abcès est causé par des germes. Ces derniers pénètrent sous la peau pour les raisons suivantes: · Morsures d'autres animaux ou d'insectes comme les tiques et les mouches. · Objets coupants, par exemple les épines ou les clous, qui percent la peau. · Injections ou vaccinations pratiquées avec des aiguilles souillées. · Maladies provoquant des abcès. Au cours de certaines maladies, des abcès peuvent se développer dans les ganglions lymphatiques (glandes) (voir module 3). Abcès dans les ganglions lymphatiques (glandes) Chez les animaux, les ganglions lymphatiques sont analogues à ceux que vous avez dans votre corps sous la mâchoire et aux aisselles. Quand un animal est infecté, les ganglions lymphatiques sont souvent tuméfiés, et on peut les sentir comme des tumeurs sous la peau. Dans certaines maladies, cette tuméfaction devient un abcès. Abcès dans les ganglions lymphatiques (glandes) Traitement des abcès Certains abcès se rompent et le pus est expulsé. Vous aurez peut-être besoin d'ouvrir un abcès et vous pouvez le faire quand il est mou. Pour opérer rapidement, vous devez procéder comme suit: · Nettoyez l'abcès et la région environnante à l'eau et au savon. Enfoncez une aiguille propre dans l'abcès. S'il sort du sang, enfoncez l'aiguille dans une autre partie de l'abcès. S'il sort du pus quand l'aiguille est enfoncée dans l'abcès, retirez l'aiguille et, avec un couteau propre bien aiguisé, une lame de rasoir ou un scalpel, faites une petite perforation à travers la peau dans la poche de pus. Ensuite, pratiquez une incision vers le bas à travers la peau, jusque dans le pus, et laissez le pus s'écouler en dehors de l'abcès. · Le pus une fois évacué, l'abcès est traité comme une plaie (voir module 73). · Si l'abcès n'est pas assez mur pour être percé, trempez un linge dans de l'eau chaude et placez-le sur l'abcès pendant 10 minutes chaque fois. Il vous faudra procéder ainsi quatre fois par jour pendant quelques jours jusqu'à ce que la tumeur ait grossi et soit devenue assez molle pour être incisée. Le pus contient des germes. Vous devez ramasser tout le pus dans un morceau de papier ou un linge et le brûler. Lavez la partie de la peau qui entoure l'abcès. Lavez-vous les mains et désinfectez toutes les aiguilles et tous les instruments utilisés. Si l'abcès est profond sous la peau et ne se crève pas, et si l'animal a de la fièvre, vous devrez demander l'aide du vétérinaire. Si vous ne pouvez pas l'obtenir, vous pouvez administrer des antibiotiques ou des sulfamides par voie orale ou par injection pendant trois jours (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1). Ne percez pas les abcès des ganglions lymphatiques, mais administrez à l'animal un antibiotique ou un sulfamide pendant trois jours pour traiter l'infection. Hématomes On observe des hématomes quand un animal a reçu des coups de pied ou a été battu. La tumeur est molle et elle n'est ni chaude ni douloureuse; elle disparaîtra au bout de deux à trois semaines. Vous ne devez pas frapper les animaux ni essayer d'en soulever un par la peau car cela provoquerait des hématomes. Si vous désirez vendre les animaux pour l'abattage, les hématomes apparaîtront sous forme de zones d'un bleu rougeâtre dans la viande. Tumeurs dures Les tumeurs dures ne sont pas chaudes comme des abcès, ni molles comme des hématomes. Elles peuvent grossir continuellement ou cesser d'augmenter au bout de quelque temps. Vous devrez demander conseil à votre vétérinaire si ce type de tumeur se développe chez un animal. La gourme chez le cheval La gourme est un abcès des ganglions lymphatiques sous la mâchoire des jeunes chevaux, mulets et ânes. L'animal a une forte température, un abcès apparaît sous la mâchoire et il y a un écoulement épais et crémeux aux naseaux. Vous devrez isoler l'animal et obtenir l'aide du vétérinaire pour percer cet abcès. L'abcès une fois percé, l'animal peut être soigné aux antibiotiques. La gourme chez le chevalModule 76: L'empoisonnement Normalement, les animaux ne mangent pas les plantes vénéneuses. Ils peuvent être poussés à le faire si d'autres fourrages font défaut. Il peut arriver que des animaux mangent des plantes vénéneuses qu'ils ne connaissent pas s'ils sont transférés une région nouvelle contenant des plantes vénéneuses différentes. Les poisons comme la warfarine (mort-aux-rats) et la strychnine peuvent être des causes d'intoxication chez les animaux. On utilise encore dans certaines régions des bains de déparasitage à l'arsenic, qui peuvent provoquer une intoxication. Parfois, les animaux sont empoisonnés à dessein par les gens. La forme la plus répandue d'empoisonnement dangereux est la morsure de serpent. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: · Quels sont les signes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux.· Quelles sont les causes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux.· Comment traiter des animaux intoxiqués.· Que faire en cas de morsure de serpent. Les signes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux Un animal empoisonné peut mourir subitement ou manifester les signes suivants: · La salivation est excessive.· La bouche est ouverte et l'animal tire la langue.· L'animal a de la diarrhée et des vomissements.· L'animal respire avec difficulté. Les causes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux Les causes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux sont nombreuses: · Il existe une grande variété de plantes vénéneuses. Vous devez vous entretenir avec les membres de votre communauté pour découvrir quelles sont les plantes vénéneuses dans votre région. · Il se peut que les semences destinées aux plantations aient été traitées avec des produits chimiques. Si les animaux ou les êtres humains en mangent, ils risquent de mourir. · La strychnine, qui est un poison utilisé pour tuer les chiens sauvages et les loups, peut aussi empoisonner les autres animaux. · Les désherbants utilisés en agriculture peuvent être toxiques. · Les produits chimiques utilisés pour tuer les insectes sur les végétaux, ou dans les bains de déparasitage pour combattre les parasites externes, sont toxiques. · Les vieilles peintures, le pétrole, le carburant diesel et d'autres carburants et huiles sont également toxiques. · Outre les rongeurs, la mort-aux-rats peut empoisonner d'autres animaux. · Les animaux peuvent être intoxiqués par le sel, s'ils ne peuvent pas boire de grandes quantités d'eau. Parfois, les gens empoisonnent délibérément les animaux. Traitement des animaux intoxiqués Vous ne pouvez pas faire grand-chose en cas d'empoisonnement. Vous devrez demander l'aide du vétérinaire le plus tôt possible. Essayez de découvrir ce qui a causé l'empoisonnement et d'empêcher que d'autres animaux soient empoisonnés. · Le charbon de bois mélangé à de l'eau et administré sous forme de breuvage est un bon traitement en cas d'empoisonnement. Donnez à l'animal 1 g pour 20 kg de poids corporel. · Le kaolin, une poudre blanche, peut être mélangé à de l'eau et administré sous forme de breuvage. Donnez 10 g à un animal de petite taille et 200 g à un cheval ou à un chameau. Morsures de serpent Il existe de nombreux serpents qui sont venimeux pour les animaux et pour l'homme. Les animaux sont surtout mordus à la face et aux pattes. Habituellement, quand nous découvrons qu'un animal a été mordu par un serpent, il est trop tard pour intervenir. Si vous êtes avec un animal quand il est mordu, vous devez l'examiner et écarter les poils ou la laine pour découvrir les deux blessures, petites mais profondes, laissées par les crochets du serpent. Vous devez utiliser un tourniquet (voir module 73) pour empêcher que le venin provenant d'une morsure sur la patte ne se répande partout dans l'organisme. Relâchez le garrot toutes les 20 minutes pour permettre au sang de circuler. Vous devez demander au vétérinaire de venir immédiatement car il sera nécessaire de faire à l'animal une injection contre le venin du serpent.\u001b[0m\n",

All Rights Reserved, UGC CARE Listed ( Group -I) Journal 517 Therapeutic Use Of Medicinal Plants Used For The Treatment Of Animals S.Nayak, j. Pradhan, T.roy KISS Deemed University,Bhubaneswar Abstract The present study is based on the plant parts used by indigenous people for the treatment of different diseases of animals. The villagers, medicinal practitioners, and traditional healers used plants and their extracts for the treatment of animal diseases. Data were collected from the experts regarding the use of plants to cure animals. A total of 50 plants were identified and the plant parts having medicinal value were also documented. The study shows that each part of the plant is having some medicinal value. Mainly the rhizome, leaf, bark, stem, and seed are used for the preparation of different medicines. The tribal used the indigenous medicinal plants for the treatment of animal diseases, especially for cattle.

They get food, medicine, fiber, fodder, and timber from the forest. A wide variety of plants are also used by the tribal as medicine for human beings as well as animals. They not only consume edible foods but also sell them in the market to earn a livelihood. They grow the plants by using organic fertilizer and pesticides that increase the nutritious value of food products. The indigenous people have traditional knowledge about the treatment of animals. Even in modern days, people depend on folk medicine for the treatment of animals. The elderly people and veterinary practitioners. Ethnobotanical survey in Koraput district Ethenobotanical survey in koraput district was undertaken by various researchers. (P.K Das.,1995,S.Das,M.Misra,1995) Study Area The study on therapeutic use of different medicinal plants was carried out in the Rayagada district of Odisha. Rayagada is a district in southern Odisha.

All the family members are involved in the collection of plant parts such as leaves, roots, fruits, seeds, and barks from the forest. They also extract gums, resins, latex, and commercially important dyes. The indigenous people of the study area grow and harvest different plant parts i.e. leaves, roots, seeds, barks, and fruit for the preparation of traditional remedies. 77 The local Vaidya have great knowledge about medicinal plants. Investigation of data shows that fifty species of plants are used for the treatment of thirty-two types of different diseases e-ISSN 2320 –7876 www.ijfans.org Vol.11, Iss.7, 2022 Research Paper © 2012 IJFANS.

One plant each is used for the treatment of fever, liver disorder, jaundice, Abdominal pain, Measles, to kill flea and lice, Eye infection, swollen tongue, dysentery, Yoke gall treatment, sores treatment, Arrest bleeding in wounds, Bronchial and cough treatment, Dyspepsia, Induction of Oestrus, Stomachic diuretic, Anthelmintic, Tooth disease, Analgesic, Treatment of spasm of bladder, neck swelling. Two plants each are used for curing Carminative, worm treatment, Eradication of worms, Bone fracture, and Rheumatism. Most of the species are local and some species are grown in the garden. The plant species are arranged systematically. For each species details of the scientific name, and local name parts used for the treatment of diseases are mentioned. It is also observed that leaves are used frequently followed by root, stem, seed, and whole plant parts. Conclusion The study revealed that plants play a vital role in curing different diseases. The traditional knowledge and practice of tribal people on herbal practice should be preserved as there is a high risk of extinction. These rare medicinal plants can be used further for a research purposes if we conserve them. After several pieces of research, it is observed that plant products are very effective in the treatment of animal diseases. The study shows that due to the lack of interest of local youths in herbal plants the traditional knowledge of plants is getting declined. Therefore proper documentation of these plants is to be done for further research purposes. Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the local Vaidyas, local people having traditional knowledge. We are also thankful to the authority of KISS University for their support. e-ISSN 2320 –7876 www.ijfans.org Vol.11, Iss.7, 2022 Research Paper © 2012 IJFANS.

Katerere and Vinny Naidoo Index.......................................................................................................................409 ix Foreword From before written history, plants have been known as sources of medicines for treating human beings. In practically every human culture, there exists a vast trea- sury of information of this type, and in some civilizations, notably in China and India, this has developed into a sophisticated system of diagnosis, treatment, and preparation of the medicine. As far as “Western” scientific medicine is concerned, natural substances were, and still are, the source of many isolated chemicals that are incorporated as the active constituents into familiar pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets, cap- sules, injections, and topical applications such as creams and ointments. The rise and application of pharmaceutical chemistry enlarged the potential of naturally occur- ring compounds for use as drugs since they could also be used as “lead molecules” to improve their efficacy or reduce toxicity by chemical manipulation of the structures. Traditional plant-based extracts became very marginal in most countries where “sci- entific” medicine became the norm. However, in spite of the undoubted successes of such a scientific approach to phar- maceuticals, the last few decades have witnessed a spectacular rise in interest and use of “herbal medicinal products” (i.e., plant material or its crude extracts) in those places where sophisticated technologically advanced medicine was common, as well as in countries where it has long formed the mainstay of medicines used by ordinary people. This general interest has been followed by increasing scientific and commer- cial interest in traditional medicines, and in 1967 the term ethnopharmacology was coined to describe the scientific discipline investigating the use of these products. Since that time, scientific investigations in this area have grown apace, as wit- nessed by the success of scientific journals such as Journal of Ethnopharmacology and Phytotherapy Research, as well as by good attendance at international confer- ences dealing with such matters and introduction of university courses. This has been fueled partly by the pharmaceutical industry seeking new lead compounds but also by an awakened interest and patrimonial pride in their traditions by many coun- tries emerging from their colonial past. At one level, such research gives substance to traditional claims and reinforces the value of the cultural heritage, but if it dem- onstrates efficacy and safety, it might also lead to substitutes for expensive imported Western drugs. Since Western drugs are often beyond economic or geographical reach of many of the inhabitants of these places anyway, scientific study can also lay the basis for improving the quality of the traditional remedies, thus providing better grounds for efficacy and safety. As far as the industrially developed countries are concerned, intensive farming has been widely practiced but has raised not only food production, but also many ethical and health concerns, giving rise to the “organic” preference of many consum- ers. Hence, the investigation of these traditional “natural” medicines might provide alternatives to current treatments of animals that have caused much concern, such as the widespread use of antibiotics in young animals, producing residues in food x Foreword and thereby the buildup of resistance in humans and other animals. The entry into the food chain of hormones and other steroids for building muscles and stimulating growth may affect human metabolism and health. The study of traditional medicines might provide compounds or extracts with novel structures or different mechanisms of action, with less-acute or chronic side effects, which would make good substitutes for the currently used drugs that are raising concern. This interesting, and in some ways surprising, explosion of scientific interest and study into traditional materials for helping human health care has only fairly recently been enlarged to encompass use of traditional medicines for treating ani- mals. Urbanized and relatively affluent members of society have a mainly emotional attachment to domestic “companion” animals, on which they are willing to spend considerable amounts of money, and it is not surprising that herbal products to treat domestic animals sell well. However, it should not be forgotten that, for most rural parts of the world, animals are important sources and symbols of wealth and liveli- hood. When the animal becomes sick or dies, it may mean the loss of transport, aid to farming, dairy products, meat, and other products such as wool or hair, which provide extra income or clothing. The death of a single animal may spell the begin- ning of poverty for a whole family. It is therefore not surprising that in many societies there is a pharmacopoeia of substances used to treat livestock and poultry. The growing interest in this from sci- entists was reflected in a session dedicated to veterinary ethnopharmacology at the Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology in São Paulo, Brazil, in September 2008. This book is another indication and is the first, to my knowledge, to bring together a considerable amount of information about ethnoveterinary medi- cines from a wide variety of countries. As well as listing plants used, the conditions for which they are used, and the ways that the plant material is treated prior to use, this book covers useful topics such as general research methods for testing claimed effects and safety and the chemical examination of extracts. The inclusion of a chap- ter on benefit sharing is particularly praiseworthy since it is all too easy for a culture to have its traditional knowledge “stolen” to be used commercially by an outside body that returns no benefits. Dr. Katerere and Dr. Luseba have been fortunate enough to persuade leading authorities in this field to contribute chapters, and I am sure that it not only will prove to be a valuable reference source but also will stimulate further research into this fascinating area, with the end result of improving not only the health of animals and domestic birds, but also the well-being of their owners and farmers.

McGaw and Jacobus N. Eloff 1.1 \u0007Introduction In many developing countries with limited access to orthodox health care services, the majority of rural people rely on traditional medicines to alleviate a variety of ailments. Likewise, many pastoralists use customary remedies to treat their sick ani- mals. Commercial pharmaceutical drugs are sometimes available in remote rural areas, but they are often dispensed by untrained vendors or repackaged without printed instructions, which may not be able to be read by illiterate users in any case, leading to drug misuse (Mathias, 2007). In an effort to improve animal health care services in rural areas, it is vital to utilize all available resources, including ethno­ veterinary medicine (EVM).

Several research papers in international publica- tions have confirmed a heightened recognition of the need for rigorous scientific investigation of EVM remedies. Studies of biological activity of plants used against veterinary diseases can provide indications of promising leads for extracts that can be developed and used on a commercial basis. Plants with activity may also provide leads for isolation and identification of useful compounds that may be chemically modified to optimize medicinal value and reduce possible toxic effects, in other words, developed into pharmaceuticals. For common conditions such as coughs, wounds, skin diseases, mild diarrhea, and reproductive disorders, EVM can be a cheap and easily obtainable alternative to expensive orthodox drugs. For epidemic infectious diseases, including anthrax, rinderpest, rabies, and foot-and-mouth disease, modern drugs (mostly vaccines) are preferred. Many drugs in conventional therapy are based on chemical compounds of plant origin or on synthetic derivatives of these chemicals. The search for alternative antibacterials and anthelmintics in particular is intensifying following problems associated with drug resistance and chemical residues in production animals. EVM practices, if proven to be effective and not harmful, may provide answers (not only regarding plant-based remedies but also concerning management customs) to some of these problems currently encountered in conventional veterinary practice. Much research has been undertaken, especially as reflected by the expanding scientific literature, concerning the ethnopharmacological investigation of plants used to treat humans for various illnesses. This has been followed by an interest in plants used in animal health. It is logical that in evaluating these plants for bio- logical efficacy and safety that similar bioassays are used in a laboratory situation where plants are being investigated for similar types of activity. It is essential to build and maintain standards for assessing the therapeutic potential of plants to facilitate comparison of results between different research groups (Cowan, 1999). In this chapter, methods for evaluating traditional ethnoveterinary plant-based rem- edies used for treating common diseases are discussed. Some results obtained in these assays with particular reference to the South African context are supplied. Considerations to be taken into account when embarking on research in this field are also presented and discussed. 1.1.1 \u0007The Need for Evaluating Traditional Animal Treatments There is a pressing case for investigating EVM remedies for two major reasons: investigation of their use as effective agents for treatment of particular ailments and to appraise their safety. Undoubtedly, there are dubious, questionable, or even harmful practices forming part of alternative treatment of livestock, and these need to be distinguished from those of value. The profile of EVM would benefit from validation of certain practices in the view of potentially skeptical, conven- tionally trained veterinarians who may have only been exposed to the results of injurious handling by rural farmers attempting to rid their animals of disease or parasite infestations. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 3 Other advantages to be gleaned from ethnoveterinary research entail prospects for commercial development, whether as refined extracts or lead compounds for the pharmaceutical industry. An important aspect, which falls outside the scope of this chapter, is the necessity for benefit-sharing agreements with owners of the intellectual property concerning EVM (see Chapter 2). This may involve returning value-added knowledge to the community where the information originated if such a community can be identified. Alternatively, they could be included in a profit-sharing arrange- ment from the outset, without raising initial false hopes of massive profits to be obtained from a product that may display exciting bioactivity in the laboratory, while many obstacles lie in the path to commercial success. Various approaches have been proposed to validate animal herbal remedies, such as literature reviews, laboratory and clinical studies developed in medicine, social science methods (i.e., ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy by livestock owners), and investigation of the influence of a remedy on animal production and economic considerations (Mathias, 2004). Much work remains to be done in this area. In a review of the current status of published information on the ethnoveterinary use of plants in South Africa and biological activity and toxicity investigations on these plants (McGaw and Eloff, 2008), more than 200 plant species were documented as used in EVM, and of these, a mere 27 species have been tested for bioactivity in targeted ethnoveterinary assays. It was concluded that more plants need to be evalu- ated, and expanded investigation of those plants already tested in one or two screen- ing systems needs to be carried out (McGaw and Eloff, 2008). The targeted investigation of plants for commercial application in human med- icine has resulted in natural products and their derivatives representing about 50% of all drugs in clinical use, of which higher plants contribute 25% to this figure (Farnsworth, 1984; O’Neill and Lewis, 1993). Plants have a seemingly lim- itless ability to manufacture unusual and original chemical structures. Also, a major mechanism plants possess to fight infection is the production of chemicals with anti-infective activity (phytoalexins); thus, it is logical and reasonable to explore the potential presence and ability of such compounds to be useful in both human and animal health care, for example, in terms of antibacterial or antifun- gal activity. Ethnoveterinary remedies need to be validated before they can be widely pro- moted. Information on the botany and phytochemistry of particular plants may already be available in the literature, relating to bioactivity and toxicity. There is frequently an overlap between medicinal plants used to treat animals and those used to treat humans. It could be speculated that livestock keepers have over the centuries modi- fied human remedies for use in animals or vice versa. It would make sense that similar treatments are used to treat comparable ailments in humans and their livestock. Ethnoveterinary medicines can function as leads for drug development, but per- haps a more useful and cost-effective exercise would be to improve a selected prepa- ration by pharmacological research and development, and the resulting remedy can be returned to the community with addition of value. Local farmers can grow the plants and make money from this venture, and such commercialization can also aid in the conservation of useful species. Other issues falling outside the ambit of this chapter include the necessity to conduct research into optimal dosing regimens and 4 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health effective concentrations of herbal remedies. Potential side effects as well as toxins that may be ingested by the animals and then transferred to humans through milk or meat are further issues to be addressed. 1.2 \u0007Biological Activity Screening It has been estimated that at least 250,000 species of plants inhabit our world (Borris, 1996). A mere 5–15% of higher plants have been systematically investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds, so plant biodiversity is virtually unexplored (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). Plants contain an enormous diversity of chemical structures, which are secondary metabolites modulating the relationship of organ- isms with the environment, for example, as pollinator attractants, signal products, and defensive substances against parasites, predators, and other pathogens (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). Such compounds in plants therefore hold much potential for medicinal applications. Following up ethnomedical leads, whether plants are used in human or in animal medicine, is one approach to selecting plants for bioactivity screening. Other methods of bioprospecting for screening studies include random selection and chemotaxonomic selection approaches. Bioassays used to evaluate plant extracts should meet many criteria, including validity, lack of ambiguity, accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and reasonable cost (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). More particular considerations are a high selectivity (to limit the number of leads for subsequent evaluation), a high sensitivity (to detect low concentrations of active compounds), and a high specificity (to be insensitive to a variety of inactive compounds and eliminate false positives) (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). In vitro tests in ethnopharmacological studies are prevalent in the scientific literature even though in vivo models supply more accurate evidence for the activity of plant preparations in traditional medicine. This is largely as a result of the fact that the use of in vivo models is severely restricted in many countries owing to economic and ethical concerns (Houghton et al., 2007). The smaller amount of plant material needed for an in vitro test is often an important consideration. Methods of extraction and in vitro testing need to be standardized so that the eval- uation of medicinal plants can be systematic, and comparisons of results obtained by different laboratories may be more useful. In an important review article on the subject of anti-infective potential of natural products, Cos et al. (2006) emphasized that certain pivotal quality standards must be set at the stage of extract process- ing and primary evaluation in pharmacological screening models. The authors pro- vided extremely useful recommendations to help define a more acceptable “proof of concept” for antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic activity in natural products. They outlined the following requirements for anti-infective screening: 1. Use of reference strains or fully characterized clinical isolates (in the case of microorganisms, the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] strains are widely used as standards). 2. In vitro models on the whole organism, if possible cell based. 3. Selectivity evaluation by parallel cytotoxicity testing or integrated profiling against unrelated microorganisms. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 5 4. Adequate dose range, enabling dose-response curves. 5. Stringent end-point criteria with IC50 values generally below 100 µg/mL for extracts and below 25 µM for pure compounds. 6. Proper preparation, storage, and in-test processing of extracts. 7. Inclusion of appropriate controls in each in vitro test replicate (negative, positive, and growth controls). 8. Follow-up of in vitro activity (“hit” status) in corresponding animal models (“lead” status). A variety of test systems should be employed in the in vitro screens because the use of only one bioassay yields an incomplete picture of the effect of the extract on the whole system involved (Houghton et al., 2007). Many diseases involve more than one factor, and Houghton et al. (2007) cautioned that the use of a single in vitro test is generally too simplistic and reductionist to achieve an idea of biological activity. An assortment of chemicals is present in an extract, and these may each have a different biological or pharmacological activity, together contributing to the overall clinical effect (Houghton et al., 2007). It is therefore preferable to use a range of tests for dif- ferent activities, all related to the particular disease state under investigation. Pharmacological evaluation of medicinal plants followed by bioassay-guided fractionation can lead to the isolation of pure active compounds with potential for commercialization. An alternative to this route, particularly pertinent to developing countries, is the preparation of standardized, formulated extracts that could con- tribute to an innovative and successful local pharmaceutical industry (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). A growing number of publications document the use of herbal remedies by small- scale farmers to treat an assortment of livestock diseases, from skin conditions to babesiosis and anaplasmosis (Masika, Sonandi, and Van Averbeke, 1997; Masika, Van Averbeke, and Sonandi, 2000; Dold and Cocks, 2001; Van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha, 2001; Njoroge and Bussmann, 2006; Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Methods of obtaining information range from participatory methods to semistruc- tured interviews, field observations, and questionnaire surveys. This expanding doc- umentation of plants used in EVM is anticipated to precede increased investigation of these plants for bioactivity, reflecting the situation in human ethnomedicine. It is generally accepted that a great deal of work remains to be done on recording the uses of plants in EVM. Factors to be taken into consideration by researchers aiming to evaluate the bio- logical activity of herbal EVM remedies include whether the plants are used singly or in combination with other plants, the plant part used, method of preparation, dos- age, and the way in which the remedy is applied. For example, herbal remedies can be prepared from fresh or dry material in the form of infusions, decoctions, pastes, or expressed juices from fresh plants. Masika, Van Averbeke, and Sonandi (2000) stated that the route and method of application of a remedy depends on the perceived cause of the disease condition. Topical applications are commonly used for skin con- ditions, powders are rubbed into incisions, drops are placed in the ears and eyes, and drenches are popular in treating systemic conditions. In other studies in South Africa, it was noted that plants are generally not processed or mixed with other materials and 6 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health are used as single-plant decoctions or infusions for dosing animals or crushed and used topically for wound treatment (Van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha, 2001; Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). This is in contrast with traditional medicine intended for human use, for which processing (milling, extracting, etc.) and mixing of two or more plant species (and even animal parts) appears to be common practice. 1.2.1 \u0007Limitations of Laboratory Testing of EVM Remedies As EVM is a complex system of practices involving more than just the application of plant-based remedies to sick animals, it may give rise to misleading expectations about the degree of efficacy of a single plant used as part of a cure. Diagnosis of a disease made by a rural farmer may be inadequate as it is easier to identify symp- toms than the actual cause of the disease. Dosages are not precise, contributing to the perception that the remedies are not standardized. The methodology for validating EVM should be scientifically acceptable but also must take into account the prob- ability that EVM remedies might not work as powerfully as orthodox medicines. They may not completely eliminate all microorganisms causing a particular disease, but this could allow the body’s immune system to build up immunity against the remaining organisms. It must be kept in mind that ethnoveterinary practices com- prise a complex system and isolating one aspect for efficacy studies may not yield the anticipated results, although the system might be adequate for the conditions in the field. Fundamentally, if a plant-based ethnoveterinary remedy is to be deemed suit- able for further development, efficacy and toxicity tests must meet certain standards. Legal constraints must be kept in mind if commercial development is anticipated. However, this standard is not so rigorous if the validation and understanding of EVM is the aim of the study. Research can be used to select a particular remedy, improve it through pharmacological and toxicological research, and then return it as a value- added product to the community. In EVM studies, traditional methods of dosage and preparation of remedies are vital components often neglected for the sake of ease of preparation and standard- ization of laboratory extracts for testing. For a more true reflection of efficacy of the treatment, it would be advisable to closely follow if possible the preparation and application technique employed by the indigenous user. On the other hand, there is a case to be made for using standard scientific methods to prepare aqueous and organic solvent extracts if extraction of a wide range of chemicals present in the plant is desired for in vitro studies. Traditional remedies may be composed of single plants or mixtures of plants, and if mixtures are employed it is recommended to test not only the individual component plants, but also the mixture in the correct proportions used tradition- ally. Repeatability of activity is important, and together with well-designed screen- ing programs to elucidate activity using complementary techniques, plant material sourced from different areas could be included in a screening program. The accurate identification of plant material is naturally essential, and numbered voucher speci- mens should be deposited at a reputable herbarium to allow other researchers to verify the identity of the plants as well as to make allowances for possible future taxonomic revisions. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 7 A further limitation in the laboratory testing of EVM remedies is the difficulty in culturing parasitic nematodes and protozoa, for example. Parasitic infestations of intestinal worms are commonly diagnosed and treated by livestock keepers. Some model systems are available, such as the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis ele- gans, for detecting anthelmintic activity, but sometimes the only true indication of efficacy is activity in an animal model. It is often not possible to assume efficacy in vivo after achieving good results with in vitro tests. First, it may not be practical to extrapolate the dose from that which is active in vitro to that which would be required to reach adequate plasma concen- trations in the target species (Houghton et al., 2007). Bioavailability is an essential consideration if the remedy is orally administered. Second, factors such as absorp- tion and metabolism may be responsible for discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo tests (Houghton et al., 2007). Even if rat models, for example, are used, differ- ences have been noted between intraperitoneal and oral administration. This can be explained inter alia by metabolic breakdown of compounds in the gastrointestinal tract or by lack of absorption from the gut into the bloodstream (Laupattarakasem et al., 2003). Absorption and metabolism can be affected by other compounds in the extract that may enhance or inhibit absorption, and other compounds may upregu- late metabolic enzymes in the liver. Houghton et al. (2007) noted that traditional methods of preparation of plant-based medicines might remove or concentrate such compounds, and if the correct method is not followed in making extracts for phar- macological testing, then the extract may display different activities compared to the extract prepared according to traditional methods. Most activity investigations in the published scientific literature concentrate on in vitro studies for practical, economic, and ethical reasons. Therefore, there exists an unavoidable bias toward in vitro tests for evaluation of EVM remedies as this is what is reflected in the available literature. Even in the case of in vivo studies, tests of ethnoveterinary remedies in a laboratory where the animals are given fixed diets and kept under controlled conditions, accurate indications of efficacy of the treatment may not be discovered, while in the real-life situation, conditions under which the animals are kept are more varied. 1.2.2 \u0007Extract Preparation The variety of methods by which EVMs are prepared and administered to animals complicates the task of evaluating activity of a particular remedy. The reason for which the screening is being undertaken must be kept in mind when designing the study, including preparation of the extract for pharmacological testing. If the purpose is solely to validate the use of a certain remedy, then it is advisable to closely follow the traditional method of preparation as many factors may influence the activity of the resultant mixture. In addition, the route of administration must somehow be taken into account. In some cases, it is thus possible that in vivo tests are the only mechanism by which the efficacy of an EVM medicine can be verified. Alternatively, careful design of in vitro screening systems may yield a reasonable idea of the efficacy and nontoxicity of remedies. The selection of a screening sys- tem will for the most part depend on the nature of the disease being investigated 8 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health and the availability of validated laboratory models to identify the relevant biologi- cal activity. For broader screening programs aimed at discovering biological activity in par- ticular plants used in EVM, standardized methods are widely used. Care must be taken to ensure that potentially active compounds are not lost during processing; for example, some constituents may be thermolabile or photosensitive. Plant extracts may be prepared using fresh material or, more commonly, dried powdered mate- rial. The plant material can be extracted using water or organic solvents that vary in polarity. For extraction of hydrophilic compounds, polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate can be used, while if lipophilic compounds are being tar- geted, more nonpolar solvents such as dichloromethane and hexane may be used. Eloff (1998b) examined a spectrum of solvents for their ability to extract antimi- crobial compounds from plant material and other factors, including their hazardous nature and ease of removal from the extract. The aim of the study was to identify a more standardized extraction method, and acetone was highlighted as the solvent with the best rating, followed in order by dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, and water. However, this may vary with the plant species or plant part under investigation (see also Chapter 4). Following extraction, appropriate handling of the extracts is important to avoid decomposition of active compounds or other changes that may affect biological activity. It is common practice to resuspend dried extract residues in the extracting solvent to a known concentration prior to screening, provided the extract redissolves adequately in the solvent and the solvent is not toxic in the testing system. In quan- tifying the extract, some researchers dry down only a small aliquot of the extract to determine the original concentration and then use the remaining intact extract for testing. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a popular solvent in which to prepare test compound solutions at a stock concentration (Cos et al., 2006). Test stock solutions in 100% DMSO have the advantages of elimination of microbial contamination, thus obviating the need for filter sterilization, which may lead to loss of compounds, and good compatibility with many test systems as a result of good solubility when diluted to a working concentration in aqueous medium. As DMSO is potentially toxic for cells in tissue culture or microorganisms, the final testing concentration of the sol- vent should not exceed 1% (Cos et al., 2006). Acetone was put forward as the solvent of choice for use in antibacterial testing systems as, at the concentrations used in a serial broth microdilution assay, it was found to be nontoxic to various species of bacteria tested (Eloff, 1998a). This was also held to be the case for antifungal assays based on a similar method (Masoko, Picard, and Eloff, 2005). Regarding storage issues, Cos et al. (2006) recommended that compounds and extracts should gener- ally be stored without solvent for long-term storage or in 100% DMSO at −20°C with minimal exposure to freeze-thaw cycles or humidity. This is meant to reduce degradation of components. Storage in methylated solvents is not advised because of the possible formation of artifacts. In the following sections of this chapter, examples of EVM plants that have been screened for biological activity, the methods used to screen them, and indications of activity discovered in the plants are given. Particular emphasis is placed on treatments for those diseases of importance in livestock. Techniques available for bioassaying Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 9 the plant preparations are described briefly and references given for more detailed information. It is commonly found that there is an overlap between veterinary and human medicine in many communities, but the emphasis here is on the former. 1.2.3 \u0007Antibacterial and Antifungal Different classes of antibacterial assays have been described, and many of these are applicable to antifungal detection as well. Antibacterial assays may be broadly divided into agar diffusion, dilution, and bioautography methods. In agar diffusion, a reservoir containing a known concentration of the test substance is brought into contact with an inoculated medium, and the diameter of the inhibition zone (clear zone) around the reservoir is measured after incubation. Before incubating, the com- pounds from the reservoir are commonly allowed to diffuse into the agar medium at a lower temperature for a few hours before inoculation with the test bacteria (Cos et al., 2006). The types of reservoirs used can be filter paper disks placed on top of the agar surface or wells punched into the agar, for example. Advantages of the sys- tem include small sample requirements and the ability to test up to six extracts per plate against one microorganism (Hadacek and Greger, 2000). However, a major dis- advantage is that this method is not suitable for testing nonpolar samples or samples that are unable to diffuse readily through the agar matrix (Cos et al., 2006). With dilution methods, the test sample is mixed with a medium (liquid broth or solid agar) inoculated with the test microorganism. Growth of the microorganism after incubation can then be monitored in various ways. In agar dilution methods, the min- imum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of test compound able to inhibit visible microbial growth. In broth dilution methods, turbidity (measured visually or spectrophotometrically) and redox indicators (commonly a tetrazolium salt, e.g., p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet [INT], 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tet- razolium bromide [MTT], or resazurin) are usually used to detect microbial growth. The presence of “cidal” or “static” effects of a certain concentration of compound or extract can be determined using broth dilution methods (Cos et al., 2006). Minimal bactericidal or fungicidal concentrations (MBC or MFC, respectively) can be detected by plating out samples at inhibitory concentrations onto agar and assessing growth (static) or no growth (cidal) after incubation. Dilution methods are useful in testing both polar and nonpolar extracts or compounds. The microdilution assay, using various growth indicators, including tetrazolium salts, has been successfully used with fast- growing species of mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. aurum, and M. fortuitum, and with slow-growing species such as M. bovis and M. avium (Chung et al., 1995; Franzblau et al., 1998; McGaw et al., 2008). For quantifying antibacterial activity, Eloff (2000) proposed that the quantity of material extracted from 1 g of dried plant material be divided by the MIC value to give the total activity of the plant. This measure, in milliliters per gram, indicates the largest volume to which 1 g of the extract (containing active compounds) can be diluted and still inhibit growth of the bacterial (or fungal) species under investigation and thus the potency of the extract. Bioautography is a valuable technique that localizes antibacterial or antifungal activity on a thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) plate. Components of an extract are 10 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health developed on a TLC plate using an appropriate mobile phase (i.e., one that separates the compounds adequately but is also relatively volatile so it evaporates rapidly from the plate). A balance needs to be struck between allowing sufficient time prior to bioautography to pass for the eluting solvent to evaporate completely from the TLC plate, but not too much time for the exposed compounds separated on the TLC plate to decompose as a result of exposure to light and oxygen. In agar overlay bioautogra- phy (Hamburger and Cordell, 1987; Rahalison et al., 1991), agar medium mixed with bacterial or fungal culture before it solidifies is poured onto the TLC plate and incu- bated. In a popular method that avoids the difficulties associated with compounds not being able to diffuse into the agar medium from the TLC plate, a suspension of bacteria or fungi in liquid medium is sprayed onto the developed TLC plate. This is termed direct bioautography (Begue and Kline, 1972). After the plate is sprayed with a suspension of a tetrazolium salt such as INT the presence of clear zones of inhibition are visualized against a purple background to indicate microbial growth. Bioautography facilitates bioassay-guided fractionation for the isolation of antibacte- rial or antifungal compounds, but its use is restricted to those microorganisms that are able to grow rapidly on a TLC plate with the limited amount of nutrients avail- able for growth in the medium that adheres to the surface of the TLC plate. In this regard, using the technique for filamentous fungi is inappropriate. Selection of test bacterial species to use in a screening procedure is dependent on the purpose of the study. For routine antibacterial screening, the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1990) (Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA) recommended the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). For antifungal screening proj- ects, representatives from the yeasts (e.g., Candida albicans), dermatophytic fungi (e.g., Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum), and opportu- nistic filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani) could be included (Cos et al., 2006). The NCCLS (1990) recommended an inoculum of approximately 105 cfu/mL for bacteria, while for yeasts and fungi an inoculum of between 103 to 104 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL is sufficient for dilution methods (Hadacek and Greger, 2000). An inoculum size that is too low may give false positive results, while a too large inoculum could increase false negatives (Cos et al., 2006). It has been estimated that about 75% of rural livestock owners in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa use plant-based treatments to treat their livestock (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). When screened against a panel of 10 bacteria and 5 fungi, extracts of Combretum caffrum, Salix capensis, and Schotia latifolia showed good activity against all the Gram-positive bacteria and some antifungal activity (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). Most of the extracts were not active against the Gram- negative bacterial species; interestingly, some water extracts actually promoted fungal growth (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). This may have been due to nutritive sugars, which partition into the aqueous fraction. The organisms used in this study were selected from those generally associated with infections or disease in humans and animals. Different concentrations of each plant extract were mixed with liq- uid agar at approximately 60°C before being poured into Petri dishes. Solvent was allowed to evaporate overnight from the plates, and bacteria or fungi were inoculated Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 11 onto the plates and inhibition of growth observed. It was concluded that the inhibi- tion of growth of Gram-positive bacteria, the Gram-negative Enterobacter cloacae, and several fungal species by water extracts of the plants indicated possible broad- spectrum antimicrobial effects of the plants, validating to a degree the traditional use of these plants (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). Ethnoveterinary plants used to treat infectious diseases in cattle were screened in a broth microdilution assay for antibacterial activity (McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007) against the organisms recommended for antibacterial testing by the NCCLS (1990). Hexane, methanol, and water extracts were found to be most active against the Gram-positive E. faecalis and S. aureus. Gram-positive species are known to be more susceptible to antimicrobials than are Gram-negative bacteria owing to differences in the bacterial cell wall composition (Vlietinck et al., 1995). It was reported by McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff (2007) that a third of plant extracts tested had MIC values less than 1 mg/mL, and it was largely methanol extracts that displayed activity. Ziziphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity in the preliminary assay (McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007), and the antibac- terial compounds 2,3-dihydroxyl-up-20-en-28-oic acid and zizyberanalic acid were subsequently isolated from the leaves (Moloto, 2004). The first compound was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, supporting claims of the efficacy of leaf pastes of Z. mucronata for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals and humans. Bizimenyera et al. (2005) identified substantial antibacterial activity against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae), also using the broth microdilution method. The root and bark extracts are used by farm- ers to treat stomach ailments such as diarrhea and dysentery in cattle (Bizimenyera et al., 2005), and the antibacterial activity discovered in extracts of the plant may warrant its use against bacterial infections. Rhizomes and roots of the popular ethnoveterinary plant Gunnera perpensa (Gunneraceae) are used to treat endometritis and retained placenta in cattle and women (Hutchings et al., 1996; Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997), and the possibility that antibacterial effects could be responsible for its activity has been investigated (McGaw et al., 2005; Drewes et al., 2005). Gunnera perpensa rhizome extracts showed only slight activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species (McGaw, Jäger, and van Staden, 2000; McGaw et al., 2005), indi- cating that antibacterial efficacy probably played a mere supporting role to the known uterotonic activity (Kaido et al., 1997) in the reputed medicinal value of the rhizome. Drewes et al. (2005) isolated 1,4-benzoquinones from the stem and leaves of G. per- pensa. One of the benzoquinones had significant antimicrobial activity, with MIC = 9.8 µg/mL against Staphylococcus epidermidis (Drewes et al., 2005). Noteworthy antifungal activity in several Terminalia species (Combretaceae) was reported by Masoko, Picard, and Eloff (2005) against various morphological forms of fungi, including yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans), molds (Aspergillus fumigatus), and thermally dimorphic fungi (Sporothrix schenckii). These fungal species were carefully selected to represent a spectrum of clinical iso- lates of the most common and important disease-causing fungi in animals. From extracts of Terminalia leaves prepared using several organic solvents, the acetone extracts were most active. 12 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health 1.2.4 \u0007Antiviral In vitro antiviral assay methods are often based on the abilities of viruses to rep- licate in cell cultures. Certain viruses cause cytopathic effects (CPEs) or form plaques in lawns of cells, facilitating detection of antiviral effects of a substance. Inhibition of viral replication can also be discovered by monitoring the presence of viral products, such as viral RNA, DNA, or polypeptides. Virucidal substances inactivate the ability of a virus to be infective extracellularly and find application as broad-spectrum biocides. Antiviral agents are more interesting as candidates for clinical use because they may interfere with some aspect of viral biosynthesis (Cos et al., 2006). Vlietinck and Vanden Berghe (1991) supplied a useful outline of cell-based assays that can be used for antiviral or virucidal evaluation of pure compounds or plant extracts. Toxicity to the host cell system must be assessed as part of the antiviral investi- gation. The Selectivity Index (SI) is the ratio of the maximum drug concentration causing 50% (or 90%) growth inhibition of normal cells (CC50 or CC90, respectively) and the minimum drug concentration at which 50% (or 90%) of the virus is inhibited (IC50 or IC90, respectively). It is essential to gain an indication of cytotoxicity of the test substance as, without this, results do not distinguish between antiviral effect and effect against the host cell system. The choice of viruses to use in a screening panel should include representatives of DNA viruses and RNA viruses and could include criteria such as their ability to replicate in the same cell culture. In the Phytomedicine Program at the University of Pretoria, we have begun investigating antiviral activity of ethnoveterinary plants against feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) as an enveloped virus relatively sensitive to environmental influences. Plants with good activity in this preliminary screen are then assayed for activity against more resistant viruses, such as the lumpy skin disease virus. No reports could be found of EVM plants being tested for antiviral activity, although many publications reported on efficacy of ethnobotanically chosen plants against a number of different viruses (e.g., Kudi and Myint, 1999; Asres et al., 2001; Lamien et al., 2005). To screen for antiviral activity, variations on virucidal assays are available in the ethnopharmacological literature, and these mainly focus on inhi- bition of viral CPE or plaque inhibition. In the virucidal assays, monolayers of the appropriate host cell type are cultured in 96-well microtiter plates. In the cytotoxic- ity aspect of the assay, serial dilutions of plant extract are exposed to the cells and incubated for a defined period at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following this, the cells are examined using an inverted microscope for signs of damage. Alternatively, a tetrazolium salt or other color indicator of cell viability may be used to detect cytotoxicity compared to untreated cells. In the antiviral test, serial plant extract dilutions are prepared as for the cytotoxicity assay, but virus is added to the cells. In their study, Kudi and Myint (1999) applied tissue culture medium infective dose (TCID50) of 105 viral particles (100 µL) to each well. The cultures were incubated for an hour to allow adsorption of viral particles, after which 100 µL per well of plant extract dilutions were added to the wells. The plates were incubated for a certain period to allow development of CPEs, if any, and results compared to the controls Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 13 consisting of only cells and cells with virus only. A range of different viruses was used in this method. In an example of a plaque inhibition assay, Zhang et al. (2007) infected monolayers of host (Vero) cells grown in six-well culture plates with 100–200 plaque-forming units (PFU) of herpes simplex virus (HSV). After incubating the plates for 1 h to allow adsorption of the virus, the inoculum was aspirated from the cells, and the cultures were overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose in culture medium containing dilutions of the test plant extract. After 3 days of incubation at 37°C, the plates were fixed with formalin, stained with crystal violet, air dried, and the number of plaques counted. Control plates consisted of those without plant extract, and the percentage of plaque formation inhibition was calculated as follows: [(Mean number of plaques in control − Mean number of plaques in test)/(Mean number of plaques in control)] × 100 1.2.5 \u0007Antiprotozoal and Antirickettsial Babesiosis is a protozoan, tick-borne disease affecting many vertebrate hosts. The rhizome extract, prepared using acetone, of the popular ethnoveterinary medicinal plant Elephantorrhiza elephantina was shown to have in vitro anti­ babesial activity (Naidoo et al., 2005). In this test system, Babesia caballi cul- tures (isolated from a horse) were incubated in 24-well culture plates with plant extracts at varying concentrations, together with uninfected blood. Parasite growth inhibition was monitored initially by a change in the color of the culture medium, where inhibited cultures remained bright red while unaffected protozoal cultures turned a dark coffee color. Culture smears were then evaluated using light microscopy to determine the percentage of infected cells. The registered antibabesial drugs diminazene aceturate (Berenil) and imidocarb diproprionate (Forray-65) were included as positive controls. Acetone extracts of Urginea san- guinea, Rhoicissus tridentata, and Aloe marlothii were not active in this assay (Naidoo et al., 2005). Another important protozoal disease occurring in domestic livestock and chickens is coccidiosis, which results from infection with Eimeria or Isospora species. Coccidiosis causes losses worth millions of U.S. dollars annually in the poultry industry, resulting from animal mortality or poor productivity as well as costs of treatment (Williams, 1999). The use of plants to combat coccidiosis is an emerging field of investigation as these remedies may function by mechanisms different from those of conventional therapeutic agents. In one such study, four plant extracts with reported antioxidant activity were screened for their anticoc- cidial activity against an artificially induced mixed Eimeria infection in poultry (Naidoo et al., 2008). Orally administered Combretum woodii was toxic to the birds at a concentration of 160 mg/kg, while Tulbaghia violacea (35 mg/kg), Vitis vinifera (75 mg/kg), and Artemisia afra (150 mg/kg) produced feed conversion ratios similar to toltrazuril, the positive control, and higher than the untreated 14 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health control. Tulbaghia violacea significantly decreased the oocyst production in the birds, and it was concluded that antioxidant-rich plant extracts have potential ben- efits in treating and possibly preventing coccidial infections (Naidoo et al., 2008). The results for extracts of T. violacea in particular provide momentum for more detailed investigation of the plant as a potential therapeutic or prophylactic anti- coccidial agent. The antirickettsial activity of Elephantorrhiza elephantina and Aloe marlothii was evaluated using an in vitro Ehrlichia ruminantium culture system (Naidoo, Chikoto, et al., 2006). Acetone extracts of the leaves were incubated with E. ruminantium cultures, and their activity was compared to that of oxytetracycline and untreated controls. Elephantorrhiza elephantina and A. marlothii demonstrated EC50 values of 111.4 and 64.5 µg/mL and EC90 values of 228.9 and 129.9 µg/mL, respectively, indi- cating good anti-ehrlichial activity. The EC50 and EC90 values for oxytetracycline were 0.29 and 0.08 µg/mL, respectively. Naidoo, Chikoto, et al. (2006) surmised that the plant extracts produced their inhibitory activity by a similar mechanism, unrelated to that of the tetracyclines. 1.2.6 \u0007Anthelmintic Helminth parasites of livestock are common in rural areas, and anthelmintic rem- edies form a major component of EVM, as is the case with human traditional medi- cine. Laboratory research on anthelmintic activity of plant extracts is constrained by the expense, ethical issues and time associated with performing in vivo trials, and the difficulties experienced in maintaining parasitic nematodes in culture systems in vitro. A free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been used as a model organism in broad screening studies as it is easier and cheaper than using parasitic nematodes (Simpkin and Coles, 1981; Rasoanaivo and Ratsimamanga-Urverg, 1993). Notwithstanding the limitations encountered in extrapolating activity against a free- living nematode to activity against a parasitic species (Geary and Thompson, 2001), most commercially available broad-spectrum anthelmintics demonstrate activity against C. elegans (Simpkin and Coles, 1981). In vitro screening investigations have revealed that many plant extracts show activity against the free-living C. elegans nematodes (McGaw, Jäger AK, and van Staden, 2000; McGaw and Eloff, 2005; McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007). A rapid inhibition assay is easy and simple to perform and entails incubating varying concentrations of plant extracts with nematodes for a defined period of 2 h and scor- ing the percentage of paralyzed or dead nematodes in comparison to the untreated control (Rasoanaivo and Ratsimamanga-Urverg, 1993). Using this assay, several plant species belonging to the family Combretaceae exhibited interesting anthelm- intic activity against C. elegans (McGaw et al., 2001). These studies may constitute a first step in validating the use of these plants in treating worm infestations in animals and in humans. In a more complicated screening system that evaluates the ability of the nematodes to grow and reproduce, plant extracts are incubated with nema- todes in appropriate culture medium with bacterial and fungal growth inhibitors in 24-well assay plates for 7 days, after which the percentage of surviving nematodes is Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 15 compared to that of the control wells (Simpkin and Coles, 1981; McGaw, Jäger AK, and van Staden, 2000). Plant extracts have also been tested using in vitro assays with parasitic nematode eggs and larvae. Egg hatch and larval development inhibition against the two most important livestock nematode parasites Haemonchus contortus and Trichostronglyus colubriformis by various plant extracts have been reported. In these assays, the nematodes are maintained in monospecifically infected lambs, and eggs are col- lected from the feces. Test substances incubated with the freshly collected eggs may inhibit hatching in the aptly termed egg hatch assay (Coles et al., 1992). The larval development assay (Coles et al., 1988) detects the ability of plant extracts, or other compounds, to retard development of the eggs into infective larvae. The combination of the two assays can provide a practical indication of anthelmintic activity of plant extracts or pure compounds isolated from the extracts. Peltophorum africanum is a popular plant for use in treating helminthosis, and the acetone extracts of the leaf, bark, and root have been screened for activity against H. contortus and T. colubriformis in the egg hatch and larval development assays (Bizimenyera, Githiori, Eloff, et al., 2006; Bizimenyera, Swan, et al., 2006). The extracts all showed activity in the assays at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, providing some support for the use of this plant in traditional medicine. Further confirmation of nontoxicity and efficacy is required, particularly in vivo. Various animal models have been used to detect anthelmintic effects of plant extracts (Kahiya, Mukaratirwa, and Thamsborg, 2003; Iqbal et al., 2006; Jabbar et al., 2007). 1.2.7 \u0007Antitick Tick-borne diseases are a major source of concern for livestock farmers. Research has been undertaken on the repellent and toxic effects of plant extracts against ticks, with promising results thus far. Nchu (2004) analyzed the repellent effects of extracts of Allium species, as well as the direct toxicity, against adults of Hyalomma mar- ginatum rufipes. Acetone extracts of A. porrum revealed a high repellency index (65–79.48%), and the dichloromethane extract of A. sativum was toxic to 100% of ticks within an hour of exposure. Lippia javanica and Tagetes minuta essential oils had a concentration-dependent effect on the ticks (Nchu, 2004), and T. minuta delayed molting to adult stage of 60% of engorged nymphs of H. m. rufipes in a growth inhibition bioassay. Thembo (2006) showed that Senna italica ssp. ara- choides ethyl acetate extracts had a concentration-dependent acaricidal effect on H. m. rufipes. When S. italica ssp. arachoides aqueous extracts were fed to guinea pigs and rabbits, the feeding performance of adult H. m. rufipes ticks appeared to be impaired (Thembo, 2006). Plants are used in many African countries as antitick agents on livestock, and 28 of these plants from Ethiopia showed promising repellency activities against adult Rhipicephalus pulchellus ticks, with Calpurnia aurea displaying the highest toxic- ity toward the ticks (Zorloni, 2007). Some plants used in South Africa as traditional arthropocides were screened for antitick effects, with Eucalyptus globoidea and Lavendula angustifolia emerging as effective tick repellents (Mkolo, 2008). 16 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health 1.2.8 \u0007Antioxidant The current literature reveals a proliferation of recent articles describing antioxidant activity of plant extracts. It should be kept in mind from the outset that most flower- ing plants contain some antioxidants, and the activity of a plant against a certain disease generally cannot be explained exclusively in terms of its antioxidant activ- ity (Houghton et al., 2007). Oxidative damage caused by free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in contributing to the progression of a number of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and diabetes. Various in vitro screening systems for antioxidant activity have been described, including those based on chemical reactions, for example, the diphenyl–picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free- radical scavenging test (Mensah et al., 2004), those involving biological models such as liposomes to mimic cell wall lipids (Dickson et al., 2006), and those involving cells challenged with prooxidants (Mensah et al., 2001). The TEAC (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) assay described by Re et al. (1999) has a major advantage in that it is applicable to both aqueous and lipophilic systems. It is a decolorization assay that measures antioxidant activity in compari- son to trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue. This assay begins with generation of the radical monocation 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), or ABTS+, a blue-green compound produced by reacting ABTS with potassium sulfate. When the free radical is incubated with antioxidants, these compounds reduce the radical to colorless ABTS, and this reaction depends on the concentration of the antioxidant and the time during which the reaction is allowed to occur. The level of decolorization as percentage inhibition of the free radical is calculated relative to the reactivity of trolox under identical conditions (Re et al., 1999). The widely used ethnoveterinary plant Peltophorum africanum is used to pro- mote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle, in addition to the previously mentioned use in treating stomach upsets (Bizimenyera et al., 2005). On screen- ing the plant for antioxidant activity using the TEAC assay, it was found that root extracts possessed good antioxidant activity, particularly the ethanol extract of the root. The level of polyphenols in the roots was also high, probably contributing in large part to the overall antioxidant activity (Bizimenyera et al., 2005). In the study of Naidoo et al. (2008), plant extracts with high antioxidant activity were shown to be effective in treating coccidiosis infections in chickens. After Naidoo et al. (2005) reported that extracts of Rhoicissus tridentata, a plant used for the treatment of babesiosis in cattle, were not effective in an in vitro antib- abesial assay, it was proposed that the reputed efficacy of this plant may result from a reduction in antioxidant cellular injury (Naidoo, Zweygarth, and Swan, 2006). Antioxidant evaluation of acetone extracts of different plant parts revealed good activity in the DPPH assay and in the TEAC assay (value of 2.5). The activity was held to owe in part to the presence of catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, and epigallo- catechin-gallate in the tuber acetone extracts as demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis (Naidoo, Zweygarth, and Swan, 2006). It was concluded that R. tridentata might be effective in animals infected with babe- siosis by limiting the degree of oxidative cellular injury (Naidoo, Zweygarth, and Swan, 2006). Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 17 1.2.9 \u0007Anti-inflammatory and Wound Healing Many disease conditions are associated with excessive inflammation (e.g., arthritis, eczema, and asthma), so assays detecting inhibition of one of the many biochemi- cal processes related to inflammation are commonly used as in vitro screens for anti-inflammatory activity (Houghton et al., 2007). These include tests for cycloox- ygenase inhibition, lipoxygenase inhibition, inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis, or nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) production. Traditional EVM makes use of many preparations to treat wounds in livestock animals as such wounds may lead to more serious problems. Wound healing is a complex combination of processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, col- lagen formation, and contraction of the collagen lattice (Houghton et al., 2007). Healing of the wound may be complicated by the presence of microbial infection and destruction of cells and tissues by reactive oxygen species. If a livestock owner uses a particular plant medicine to treat wounds, this preparation may affect one or more of the processes described. Therefore, a battery of in vitro tests should be conducted to verify the wound-healing activity of the extract, such as stimulation of fibroblast proliferation, antibacterial activity, and free-radical scavenging effects. Anti-inflammatory activity may provide short-term relief. The development of tests for wound healing, from in vivo tests to cell-based systems and chemical reactions and further to investigations into effects on secondary messengers and protein expression, has been described by Houghton et al. (2005). In an efficacy study of South African plants used for wound healing and against retained placenta, Luseba et al. (2007) discovered that several dichloromethane extracts displayed antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. Extracts of Cissus quadrangularis stem and Jatropha zeyheri root showed selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2 in the anti-inflammatory experiments. Even though water is tradi- tionally the most commonly used solvent to prepare medicinal extracts, the activity of organic extracts need not be disregarded. According to Luseba et al. (2007), in the treatment of livestock wounds the whole plant material is often locally applied, and in the case of complaints such as retained placenta, for which the treatment mixtures are given orally (and are unlikely to be filtered), active ingredients may be released. EVM remedies may in some cases be applied topically to wounds or skin infec- tions, and rodent models to evaluate in vivo effects of plant extracts and compounds isolated from them with promising in vitro activity have been reported (Kruger, 2004; Masoko, 2006). In these methods, a number of small topical wounds are cre- ated on the back of a shaved rat, and if investigating antibacterial or antifungal activ- ity as well as wound-healing effects, a bacterial or fungal culture may be used to infect some of the lesions. Following this, preparations of extract or compound in aqueous cream are applied to the wound, and various parameters such as erythema, exudate, and wound diameter are monitored throughout the duration of the study. Signs of toxicity are noted, and gross pathology is performed on necropsy. Owing to the fact that approximately six wounds can be made on each rat, the rats serve as their own controls to reduce the number of rats used in the study. One wound acts as an untreated control, another is treated with a standard antibiotic, and the remaining wounds are treated with test preparations. To allow this reduction in the number of 18 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health animals used, the assumption is made that systemic effects of the topically applied medication are nonexistent. 1.3 \u0007Toxicity Studies Toxicity investigations on EVM plant extracts are necessary, both to evaluate the potential toxic effects toward the animal being treated and to exclude false- positive activity results in antimicrobial assays arising from nonspecific toxic properties. In southern Africa, there is a rich floral diversity, and approximately 600 toxic species are known to occur in this region (Kellerman, Coetzer, and Naudé, 1992). Van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha (2001) commented that side effects and toxicity associated with the medicinal use of plants in EVM were rarely reported, although several plants used have potentially dangerous toxic effects (e.g., Boophane disticha, Ricinus communis, and Solanum species). The lack of toxic reports was ascribed to the relatively small quantities used in tradi- tional medicines (van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha, 2001). Toxicity is affected in ruminants by the degradation or binding of toxins by the ruminal microflora or the digestive tract, as harmless precursors can be converted to toxic substances or less toxic substances can be changed to more toxic ones (Naudé, Coetzer, and Kellerman, 1992). It is therefore important to evaluate potential toxic effects of EVM remedies, particularly those preferred for oral dosing. A screening regi- men that includes assays to test for genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and in vivo toxicity (acute and chronic) is advised. This section is only touched on as other chapters in this volume deal with this aspect in more detail. Several approaches have been followed to assess toxicity of natural remedies, including testing for genotoxic effects using in vitro bacterial and mammalian cell assays such as the Ames test, micronucleus test, and comet assay (Fennell et al., 2004). Luseba et al. (2007) tested dichloromethane and 90% methanol extracts of 12 South African plants used to treat retained placenta and wounds in livestock for mutagenicity and found that none of the extracts was mutagenic in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 without metabolic activation. A quick and easy way to gain a preliminary indication of cytotoxicity is to submit extracts to the brine shrimp assay. This assay has been used to detect in vitro cyto- toxic or pharmacological effects (Solís et al., 1993) as activity in this assay has been correlated with cytotoxicity in a number of cell lines, including 9KB, P388, L5178Y, and L1210 (Meyer et al., 1982; McLaughlin, 1991; De Rosa, De Giulio, and Iodice, 1994; McLaughlin, Rogers, and Anderson, 1998). The brine shrimp assay involves incubating test substances with freshly hatched brine shrimp larvae and detecting percentage mortality of the larvae. A shortcoming of this technique is that it does not account for metabolic activation of the test extracts or compounds, and it is difficult to extrapolate toxicity against a crustacean to mammalian cytotoxicity even though correlations have been noted with cytotoxicity in some cell lines. As an example, McGaw and Eloff (2005) reported that few extracts of plants known to be toxic to livestock were active in the brine shrimp assay. In a later study of plants used to treat cattle for various ailments (McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007), the lowest IC50 value recorded was 0.6 mg mL−1. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 19 Cytotoxicity assays using cell lines are generally relatively easy to perform, although specialized cell culture facilities are required. A range of cells may be used, including continuous commercially available cell lines as well as primary cells derived from animals. Various indicators of cell viability following incubation with plant extracts may be used, including those to detect mitochondrial activity or cel- lular integrity. 1.4 \u0007Conclusion Research on natural products from plants traditionally used to treat animals as well as humans is a key mechanism for identifying new chemical entities that may have interesting biological activity. Isolation of active compounds is not the only use- ful pathway in medicinal studies. Optimization of extract preparations by removing bulky inactive constituents while leaving behind compounds that may have a syn- ergistic or additive beneficial effect may also lead to useful medications. This could be of particular value when considering primary health care systems in rural areas as well as assisting rural livestock owners in managing disease in their animals. Standardized and formulated plant extracts may be an initiative for developing coun- tries to follow up in originating successful pharmaceutical industries that can com- pete with Western pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of various diseases, in both humans and animals (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). With the current con- troversy over antibiotic use as growth promoters in production animals, plants with positive effects on the growth and well-being of animals may provide alternatives to be investigated in this lucrative market. It should be kept in mind that EVM involves a complex system that merges treatment of diseases with herbal and other remedies with management practices such as disease prevention. To meet the aims of validating the uses of plants in EVM and developing and providing more cost-effective veterinary remedies, other factors such as socioeconomic assessments must take place in conjunction with pharmacological evaluations of efficacy and toxicity. Economic considerations must be taken into account; for example, a particular natural remedy may be less effective than a commercial treatment, but a cost-benefit analysis may reveal that using EVM is economically more beneficial. Management and prevention issues are integral to successful animal health care management, and promotion of the use of pharmacologically proven and nontoxic plant medicines is part of this man- agement system. In this chapter, the emphasis has of necessity been placed on in vitro evaluation of biological activity as a result of the shortage of in vivo studies concerning EVM rem- edies. Ethnopharmacological researchers must assimilate the strengths and weak- nesses of in vitro tests and take into account pharmacokinetic factors, traditional methods of preparation of medicines, the effect of other added substances or adulter- ants, and the dose showing activity. The use of accepted laboratory testing equiva- lents to animal studies is ethically and economically desirable. More than one test system related to the disease under investigation should be employed to evaluate bio- logical activity, appropriate test organisms must be used, and activity should ideally be confirmed by in vivo tests if sufficiently justified. Standardization of techniques to 20 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health improve interlaboratory comparisons of results with different plants analyzed for the same activity is a priority. These methods for evaluating efficacy need to be specific and rapid and not require a large quantity of material. While activity in vitro does not necessarily confirm the efficacy and safety of a plant extract, it may provide prelimi- nary indications of the usefulness and potential toxicity of the plant. Validation is essential to avoid perpetuation of the preconceived notion that tra- ditional medicine is primitive and inherently inferior. Strides have been taken in evaluating the usefulness of human ethnomedicine, and similar action needs to be taken to objectively evaluate EVM to avoid negative stereotypes that obscure the potential benefits to be obtained from traditional ethnoveterinary practices as well as plant-based natural remedies. Investigating the biological activity of ethnoveterinary plants may provide valuable leads for further targeted research that could generate marketable products, whether potentized extracts, isolated compounds, or modified compounds of natural origin. Overall, ethnoveterinary knowledge is an important resource that stands to benefit not only those pastoralists currently making use of traditional remedies to treat their animals, but also researchers seeking innovative and effective treatments for animal and human disease worldwide.

The unprecedented loss of biodiversity in the past few decades due to industrial exploita- tion and overharvesting has raised global concerns. The manner in which bioprospect- ing, particularly among indigenous people and the use of traditional knowledge, has been carried out in the past has also been heavily criticized, and such criticisms have centered around allegations of biopiracy, unfair distribution of benefits, ille- gal appropriation of traditional knowledge, and unethical conduct when it comes to filing and claiming patents on indigenous biological resources. To tackle these problems, various legal regimes have been instituted at interna- tional, regional, and national levels in a bid to promote the sustainable utilization of biodiversity, including medicinal indigenous plants. This chapter discusses plant and information gathering and then outlines the concept of access and benefit shar- ing (ABS) as one of the approaches adopted at the international level, through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to protect biodiversity.

Intellectual property (IP) rights issues and the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement are also discussed since the proper implementation of the CBD also has an impact on IP rights. Relevant legislation from South Africa, India, and Costa Rica regulating ABS is given as case studies of national laws that have included the CBD provisions/principles. 2.2 \u0007Medicinal Plant Gathering and Storage People have used ethnoveterinary medicines (EVMs) for generations, and many rea- sons have been advanced regarding why the practice continues. Farmers claim that medicinal plants are more efficacious than pharmaceuticals for chronic pathologies. They are reputed to have no side effects, and no withdrawal periods for consumption of meat from treated animals are needed since the plants are thought to be nontoxic. In general, ethnoveterinary products are used after conventional pharmaceutical medi- cines, for chronic cases, have proved ineffective (Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Traditional knowledge is passed orally from one generation of knowledge holders to the next both formally and informally. In this form of knowledge transmission, plant names that are different from the common names may be used to protect privi- leged knowledge. Uninformed persons may not be familiar with the nomenclature that traditional healers and knowledge holders use and will therefore not be able to collect medicinal plants by themselves (Reyneke, 1971). Social conventions also control the collection of indigenous plant material to some extent. For example, the felling of fruit trees such as Sclerocarya birrea (Marula tree) is often prohibited; the gathering of medicinal plants may be seasonally restricted; and the vegetation around cemeteries may be protected by various taboos (Cunningham, 1988). In general, traditional healers are not consulted for animal health care. They may be consulted to find lost animals or for advice and medicines to protect animals against witchcraft and ill winds. Most of the farmers learn about traditional treat- ments from older family members and other farmers. There is little reference to ancestral guidance as seen in human traditional medicine. Farmers are interested in knowing the medicines used by others, and they are willing to share the information. This is contrary to traditional healers, who tend to keep their knowledge to them- selves as it may be their only source of livelihood. Plant parts that are harvested include roots, tubers, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, gums, and nectar (Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). The phar- maceutical and toxicological effects of different parts of a plant may differ substan- tially (Iwu, 1993; Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). Plant parts that tend to be constantly available such as roots and bark are used more often than plant parts such as seed or leaves, which may be seasonal (Iwu, 1993). However, the har- vesting of roots frequently destroys plants (Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). The same applies to overharvesting of bark, while collection of leaves, fruits, seeds, and gum is usually less destructive (Cunningham, 1990). Medicinal plants are used either fresh or after a period of storage. Plant material is usually stored in a dried form. It may be cut into slices to facilitate drying. Dried material is sometimes powdered before storage. Plant material is stored in bags, Logistical and Legal Considerations in Ethnoveterinary Research 27 newspaper, glass jars, and cans. Stored plants should be protected from exposure to sun, water, dust, wind, and contact with strangers. Plant material intended for sale in markets is often tied into bundles (Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). However, ethnoveterinary herbal materials are often used fresh because they are col- lected when necessary (Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) methods are preferably used when gathering infor- mation from communities (Beebe, 1995). It is important to organize meetings with traditional leaders and the state veterinary service officers at the onset to explain the purpose of the research. Oral interviews can thereafter be conducted with farmers at dipping tanks in groups or individually. It is important to interview traditional healers and herbalists since their knowledge is rarely shared with farmers. In most cases, the interviews are conducted through a translator, who may be one of the local animal health officers. A general feedback session should be organized to correct, harmonize, and share the information among farmers. Key areas of investigation and discussions are the farmer’s socioeconomic profile, animal husbandry, and local knowledge of animal health care (ethnoetiology, ethnodiagnostics, treatments, and disease control). Detailed information on plants used is recorded, including local names of the remedies, indications, preparations, routes of administration, and dos- age if applicable. Plants should be collected under the guidance of the respondents. Botanical data should be collected using a collection form. Notes are also taken from discussions with respondents. Pictures of the plants are recorded with a digital camera, and pre- cise coordinates of the locations taken with a global positioning system instrument, if possible. Two to three specimens of each plant species are collected, labeled, and pressed for voucher specimen. If a qualified plant taxonomist is not involved in the collection, a specimen needs to be sent to a specialized botanical institution for iden- tification. This is important because a single plant species may have different com- mon or local names, or the same name is given sometimes to plants of different genera or species. Approximately 2 kg fresh plant materials are usually collected; dried under the shade, ground, and stored in darkened glass jars to prevent oxida- tion; and kept for subsequent laboratory investigations (Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Special attention should be given to succulent plants because they are prone to contamination by fungi. Freeze-drying or drying in autoclave at 40% has been suggested in the case of succulents (e.g., Aloe species). 2.3 \u0007Data Analysis Data can be analyzed by pairwise and matrix ranking. Statistical measures of cen- tral tendency, dispersion, and percentages are computed using appropriate statistical packages, such as the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc.). Statistical methods can also be used to identify plants used most frequently in veterinary medi- cine, based on the frequency of association of a particular or perceived medicinal value (botanical consistency) and the frequency of a particular plant species associ- ated with or used to treat a particular disease (Matekaire and Bwakara, 2004). This is referred to as consistency of veterinary usage. There is consistency when the same plant genus or family is mentioned at least twice for treating the same illness. 28 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health 2.4 \u0007The Convention on Biological Diversity At the international regulatory level, countries have negotiated the CBD, which was concluded at Rio de Janeiro on June 5, 1992. The CBD is a remarkable framework instrument that lays down broad goals, key objectives, and general principles to be implemented by contracting parties through measures at the national level. The three objectives of the CBD are stated in Article 1 as the conservation of biological diver- sity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. The CBD has been ratified by 191 countries; notably, the United States has signed but has not ratified the treaty (Cordell, 2000). The CBD sought to reconcile the diverging interests between states with rich bio- logical diversity (mainly the developing countries of the global south) and states with advanced technology (industrialized nations) by introducing the concept of ABS. Through the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, contracting parties (signatories to the convention) agreed to come together to conserve biological diversity and to negotiate its access. In the context of the CBD, access and benefit sharing is a phrase used to describe access granted by a contracting party of the CBD to its genetic resources to another contracting party to the CBD, with such access on mutually agreed terms (MAT) and subject to fair and equitable sharing of the results and benefits of any research carried out on the resources. The ABS provisions of the CBD have caused controversial debates between developing and developed countries and among advocacy groups, including indigenous and local communities, business, and industry (Siebenhuner and Suplie, 2005). Further, the progress toward achieving the objectives of the CBD has been painfully slow as many countries still have to pass national legislation to give effect to the spirit of the convention. Regulating ABS issues is rather complex and challenging, and in most cases it is an area that is not easily understandable as it involves a milieu of socioeconomic, legal, scientific, and environmental issues. Three regional groups—the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Andean Pact (comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)—have taken the approach of preparing guidelines for member states to encourage regional consistency in approaching ABS regulation and to help their member states in pre- paring the complex legislation required (International Development Research Center [IDRC], 2004). The ASEAN has the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Access to Biological and Genetic Resources (draft text; ASEAN, 2000) while the Andean Pact has Decision 391 on Common Regime on Access to Genetic Resources (Andean Community Commission, 1996). For its part, the OAU (now the African Union) has the African Model Legislation for the Protection of the Rights of Local Communities, Farmers and Breeders and for the Regulation of Access to Biological Resources (OAU, 2000). The regional guidelines set minimum standards for member state domestic laws and have taken different approaches to regulating the ABS area. In addition to the regional efforts, there is another international initiative that is aimed at assisting with the implementation of the ABS provisions of the CBD. This is the Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Logistical and Legal Considerations in Ethnoveterinary Research 29 Sharing of Benefits Arising Out of Their Utilization adopted in May 2002 (CBD Secretariat, 2000). These are, however, not binding as they are merely guidelines; they are voluntary and flexible and were designed mainly to facilitate the develop- ment process of national ABS laws and policies. The guidelines outline the roles and responsibilities of users and providers of genetic resources and encourage stakehold- ers to use a bilateral approach to facilitate ABS goals (Carrizosa et al., 2004). The key issues that are contained in the Bonn guidelines include advice on: 1. Involvement of relevant stakeholders and capacity building 2. Steps to be taken in the ABS negotiating process 3. Elements of prior informed consent (PIC) 4. Monetary and nonmonetary benefits and incentives 5. National monitoring and reporting and accountability 2.4.1 \u0007Access and Benefit Sharing Historically, genetic resources were regarded as a “common heritage” of human- kind that belonged to the public domain and could not be owned by a single group (Soejator et al., 2005). The advances in biotechnological research and the rise of the concomitant IP over discoveries from living material have contributed to a change in the customary treatment of genetic resources as a common good (Van Overwalle, 2005). Article 15(1) of the CBD recognized the sovereign rights of member states over their natural resources and gives authority to determine access to genetic resources to national governments subject to national legislation (CBD, 1992). Member states are therefore supposed to protect their genetic resources and accompanying tradi- tional or indigenous knowledge by enacting appropriate national ABS legislation. Access to genetic resources is, however, subject to PIC, a fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from commercial or other utilization of said resources. Access and transfer of relevant technology, which is subject to patents and IP rights, should be provided on terms that recognize and offer adequate and effective protection of such rights. 2.4.1.1 \u0007The Principles of ABS The principles of ABS center around negotiations and agreement on PIC, MAT and benefit sharing (BS). The CBD stipulated that the granting of access to genetic resources shall be on MAT and subject to PIC of the country of origin. The CBD also recognized the important role of indigenous and local communities in conserving and sustainably using biological diversity and stated that the benefits arising from their knowledge and innovation should be equitably shared. The regional and national procedures are naturally different, but they all aim to achieve the same goals of conservation, sustainable use of resources, and fair com- pensation to access. For example, the African Model Legislation for the Protection of the Rights of Local Communities, Farmers and Breeders and for the Regulation and Access to Biological Resources of the OAU provides that any access to bio- logical resources and knowledge or technologies of local communities in any part of the country shall be subject to an application for the necessary PIC and written\u001b[0m\n",

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable La spiruline est une micro-algue ou cyanobactérie bleu-vert en forme de spirale, d’où son nom, largement utilisée comme complément nutritionnel nutraceutique dans le monde entier. Elle pousse naturellement dans les réservoirs d'eau alcaline à haute teneur en sel dans les régions subtropicales et tropicales, y compris l'Amérique, le Mexique, l'Asie et l'Afrique centrale. Elle est aussi produite artificiellement dans des bacs ou bassins. Il y a plus de 400 ans elle était cultivée dans le lac Texcoco ou elle était récoltée, séchée et utilisée par les Mayas notamment, pour en faire une sorte de gâteau. Elle est riche en protéines, en vitamines et en minéraux, en acides gras essentiels comme l'EPA et le DHA (oméga-3) et en oméga-6, et en antioxydants.Pour être plus précis, et en moyenne selon la source de production : Pour 100g : Protéines 57g Glucides 24mg Fibres 3,57mg Vitamine A 570IU Vitamine B1 Thiamine 2,4mg Vitamine B2 Riboflavine 3,7mg Vitamine B3 Niacine 12,8mg Vitamine B4 Choline 66mg Vitamine B5 Acide Pantothénique 3,5mg Vitamine B6 0,4mg Vitamine C 10,1mg Vitamine K 25mcg Vitamine E (Alpha Tocophérol) 5mg Calcium 120mg Fer 28,5mg Magnésium 195mg Phosphore 118mg Potassium 1363mg Zinc 2mg Cuivre 6,1mg Manganese 1,9mg Selenium 7,2mcg Omega-3 823mg Omega-6 1254mgSuperoxyde-dismutase Alanine 4,7 g Arginine 4,3 g Acide aspartique 6,1 g Cystine 0,6 g Acide glutamique 9,1 g Glycine 3,2 g Histidine 1 g Isoleucine 3,5 g Leucine 5,4 g Lysine 2,9 Méthionine 1,4 g Phénylalanine 2,8 g Proline 2,7 g Sérine 3,2 g Thréonine 3,2 g Tryptophane 0,9 g Tyrosine 3 g Valine 4 g Je n’ai volontairement pas fait mention du contenu en vitamine B12, parce que la spiruline contient principalement de l’adéninylcobamide, dite pseudo vitamine B12, une forme de vitamine B12 inactive. En revanche elle contient aussi de la méthyl cobalamine en quantité relativement importante, et qui est une forme active de vitamine B12. Cependant, les informations à ce sujet sont très contradictoires. D’un côté on nous dit que la forme active de la vitamine B12 compense pour sa forme inactive, mais de l’autre on prétend que la forme inactive empêcherait l’absorption de la forme active... Il y a de quoi y perdre son latin. Et le contenu en iode alors, on n'en parle pas? La spiruline ne contient en principe pas d'iode, mais certaines marques en rajoutent, il faut donc bien lire les etiquettes. LES BIENFAITS DE LA SPIRULINE... DE LA TETE… AUX PATTES... ALOUETTE ! ET LE VENTRE... La spiruline est aussi ce qu’on appelle un prébiotique avec de puissants effets antimicrobiens qui aident à créer un équilibre dans la flore intestinale, en contrôlant le nombre de bactéries et de levures pathogènes, comme E. coli et Candida albicans, dans l’appareil digestif. Ceci est essentiel pour une digestion optimale et une absorption nutritionnelle. Les prébiotiques sont des polysaccharides qui ont la capacité de survivre dans l'estomac, contrairement aux bactéries probiotiques. Ils arrivent intactes dans le tractus gastro-intestinal inferieur ou les bactéries fermentent ces molécules robustes et les transforment en acides gras, si prisé par les cellules épithéliales, en substrat métabolique. ET LES YEUX Spiruline est chargée de zéaxanthine et de lutéine. Ces antioxydants sont extrêmement importants pour la santé des yeux, elle peut donc s’avérer utile dans la prévention et le traitement des cataractes, des glaucomes et l’atrophie rétinienne progressive, la rétinite d’origine diabétique, les dommages rétiniens néphrétiques et le durcissement des vaisseaux sanguins rétiniens (angiosclérose). ET LE POIL, ET LA PEAU La spiruline peut exercer ses pouvoirs sur le pelage et la peau de votre animal de compagnie. Depuis quelques mois j'ai non seulement augmenté la fréquence, mais aussi le dosage et les résultats sont impressionnants. Mon \"gros\" qui mue tellement a chaque changement climatique, au point de remplir un sac d'aspirateur tous les 10 jours, n'en a perdu que le 1/4 ce printemps, et son pelage est d'une douceur Cajoline! Ma femelle a de petits problemes de peau des que l'hiver s'en va (et c'est tot ou nous vivons), a un pelage d'une brillance exraordinaire, et pour le moment aucune demangeaisons soit 2 mois de gagnés sur la normale. Elle et mon 3eme chien (Malibu le Podenco) sont de veritables aimants a tiques, et la encore ils en attrappe 10 fois moins depuis les cures intensives de spiruline. Au lieu de leur donner la dose normale pendant 3 semaines, j'en donne en continu mais a bien plus grosses doses (voir dans le paragraphe dosage) et 2 ou 3 fois la semaine. Mais cela ne s’arrête pas là ! En effet, en 2013 une étude a été conduite sur les effets de la spiruline sur la démodécie canine. Dans le groupe de chiens traités avec une supplémentation journalière de spiruline (et un bain hebdomadaire chimique), 100% des sujets ont montré une rémission des signes cliniques sous environ 52 jours, et une guérison complète sous 70 jours, sans aucune rechute dans les 12 mois. Dans l’autre groupe de chiens qui n’étaient soumis qu’au bain chimique, seuls 3 chiens ont complètement guéris en 80-85 jours, et 80% ont montré une réduction des signes cliniques en environ 64 jours. Pour faire simple, les chiens n’ayant pas reçu de supplémentation en spiruline ont pris plus longtemps à guérir et ont eu un pourcentage de succès moindre (4). ET LE SYSTEME IMMUNITAIRE Des études in-vitro et sur des animaux indiquent que la spiruline peut stimuler le système immunitaire, protéger contre les réactions allergiques en inhibant la libération d'histamines – les substances qui contribuent aux symptômes d'allergie - et possède aussi des propriétés anticancéreuses. ET LE SANG La spiruline est un purificateur de sang puissant, en raison de sa richesse en chlorophylle qui améliore la capacité du corps à générer de nouvelles cellules comme des globules rouges ; elle fournit aussi une forme facilement absorbable de magnésium. Cette combinaison aide à oxygéner la circulation sanguine et a détoxifier le sang. Son contenu en phycocyanine et en allophycocyanine contribue aussi à augmenter le nombre de globules blancs. Des études ont aussi démontré qu’elle augmentait la production d'anticorps contre l'infection et les virus (notamment la grippe et HIV). ET LES DENTS… Tout comme l’algue ascophyllum nodosum, la spiruline peut aussi avoir un impact sur la lutte contre le tartre et la gingivite (5). Son contenu en calcium et en phosphore peut contribuer à reminéraliser les dents, mais sa richesse en vitamine C et K et ses vertus antibactériennes peuvent aussi aider à combattre le tartre dentaire. De là à dire que cela va miraculeusement faire disparaitre le tarte de votre chien ou chat, non, mais en association avec d’autres mesures, absolument ! D’ailleurs mes chiens ont régulièrement du kéfir de lait qui a eu un impact pour le moins évident sur le tartre dentaire de l’un d’entre eux, et depuis l’ajout de spiruline à leur alimentation, en cures, les résultats sont bluffants ! ETC… Enfin, elle contient des acides nucléiques (ADN et ARN) qui fournissent une méga dose de matières premières contribuant à la synthèse de la réparation de l'ADN, un extraordinaire éventail de phytonutriments antioxydants comme les anthocyanes et les caroténoïdes qui sont réputées pour leurs puissantes propriétés anti-cancérogènes. GUIDE D’ACHAT Il est important d'acheter une marque de spiruline réfutable, car elle peut être contaminée par des substances toxiques ou absorber les métaux lourds (plomb, mercure, cadmium et arsenic) de l'eau dans laquelle elle est cultivée. A ce sujet, certains sites affirment qu’on ne trouve des micro cystines que dans les algues bleu-vert et que cette toxine bactérienne n’est pas présente dans la spiruline, c’est entièrement faux. En 2008, 36 échantillons de spiruline venant de différents distributeurs en Chine ont été testés : 34 d’entre eux, soit 90%, contenaient des micro cystines. Même si certains de ces échantillons n’en contenaient que de faibles quantités, les risques liés une exposition chronique aux micro cystines doivent être pris au sérieux (1). Il existe plusieurs espèces de spiruline dont la Spirulina maxima (cultivée au Mexique, en Amérique Centrale), Spirulina pacifica (cultivée en Californie et Hawaï) et Spirulina platensis (Asie, Amérique du Sud, Kenya, Tchad) fusiformis qui sont les plus populaires. Ce petit detail devrait vous aider a determiner la provenance de votre spiruline si celle-ci n'est pas precisee sur l'etiquette. Les principaux producteurs de spiruline sont en Chine, au Japon, en Californie), à Hawaii, en Thaïlande, au Myanmar, en Australie, au Mexique, mais la France fait aussi partie des pays producteurs (spiruliniersdefrance.fr). La spiruline peut être récoltée de 2 façons : là où elle pousse naturellement, sur les eaux d’un lac comme le lac du Tchad, lac Texcoco, ou encore en Camargue, ou artificiellement dans des bassins, à l’abri des contaminations... Et c’est là qu’intervient le dilemme de la spiruline 100% bio ou pas. Pour se développer la spiruline a besoin de certains minéraux, mais surtout d’azote. Or jusqu’à récemment, ce dernier composant ne pouvait lui être apporté que sous forme d’engrais de synthèse. Depuis peu il existe une forme naturelle d’azote, à base de végétaux fermentés, mais qui dit fermentation dit bactéries. Nous entrons ici dans un domaine bien compliqué, mais il n’existe pas 30 moyens de se débarrasser des bactéries, et ceux-ci sont rarement naturels, surtout lorsqu’il s’agit de profitabilité. On doit donc faire face au dilemme bio et contenant potentiellement des bactéries, ou pas bio et contenant des résidus chimiques. Beaucoup de marques portent le logo Ecocert, or, il y aurait une différence énorme entre « contrôlé Ecocert » et « garanti Ecocert ». Personnellement j’ai du mal à comprendre la différence. Quand je le saurai, je réviserai cet article (je n’ai aucun problème à admettre mes failles). La qualité de la spiruline est impactée non seulement par sa méthode de production, mais aussi par la qualité de l'eau utilisée pour sa production étant donné que c'est un chélateur de métaux lourds. On rencontre ce probleme principalement dans la spiruline venant de zones ou on pratique l'agriculture intensive, et ou les nappes fréatiques et les sources d'eau sont contaminées par les rejets de pesticides et autres polluants, c'est notamment le cas du plus gros producteur mondial, la Chine, mais malheureusement aussi de la France ou quasiment tous les cours d'eau sont polués. Autre détail : si elle est cultivée sous serre, certains disent que tous les rayons du soleil ne passent pas, et qu'elle n'est donc pas de bonne qualité, mais les opposants a cet argument clament que si a l'air libre, elle récolte toutes les molecules qui sont dans l'air et ne peut donc pas etre pure. PAILLETTES, POUDRE OU COMPRIMÉS ? On trouve la spiruline sous plusieurs formes, les plus courantes étant les paillettes, la poudre et les comprimés. A partir du moment où il y a transformation, la qualité s’en ressent et cela peut aussi inclure certains additifs pas toujours naturels. Rapport qualité prix, on ne fait pas mieux que la version en paillettes ou en poudre. Viennent ensuite les comprimés, mais attention de bien lire l’étiquette au dos du flacon. Ils sont en général compressés à la machine, et ce processus peut être a froid ou pas, ce qui est rarement indiqué sur l’emballage. Ces comprimés contiennent souvent des additifs de compression, comme du stéarate que je vous conseille d'éviter, ou de la cellulose. Cette derniere n'est pas dramatique mais vous devez en tenir compte si vous avez un animal diabétique, par exemple. Difficile de s'y retrouver, n'est-ce pas? On trouve aussi la spiruline sous d’autres formes, mais intervient alors une autre forme de transformations et des additifs. Outre le fait que cela augmente fortement le prix, je ne suis pas certaine que la qualité soit au rendez-vous. J’ai une petite préférence pour les comprimés, plus facile a doser pour des gros chiens, moins salissants (avec la poudre ça en fichait partout et ça tache !). Il y a environ 2g de spiruline dans une cuiller à café. SPIRULINE BLEUE… Parce que la spiruline est aussi appelée l’algue bleue, certains vendeurs sans scrupules vendent de la « poudre de spiruline bleue, a prix d’or bien entendu. Notez bien la différence entre « spiruline » et « poudre de spiruline ». La soi-disant spiruline bleue est en fait de la phycocyanine, un complexe pigment-protéine de la famille des phycobiliprotéines (PBP) et qui est un pigment accessoire à la chlorophylle. C’est certes un antioxydant puissant, on lui confere de nombreuses vertus medicinales et il fait l’objet d’études. Mais posez-vous la question : comment exrait-on la phycocyanine de la spiruline ? Il existe plusieurs méthodes, mécaniques ou chimique, dont notamment l’utilisation d’acide hydrochlocrique, d’acide acétique, de phosphate trisodique (produit très irritant qui requiert l’utilisation de lunettes et de gants lors de sa manipulation), de propylene glycol, ou encore par homogénéisation, congélation, et sonication. Naturel ? Pas vraiment. Et si on commence a parler empreinte écologique, on est dans de sales draps. INTERACTIONS EFFETS SECONDAIRES Il est possible que la spiruline puisse interférer avec les médicaments administrés pour supprimer le système immunitaire (les corticoïdes), y compris : Adalimumab Azathioprine Cyclosporine Etanercept Infliximab Leflunomide Méthotrexate Mycophénolate Il est aussi conseillé de ne pas donner trop de spiruline aux chiens comme les Dalmatiens a cause du fort contenu de la spiruline en purine, et de leur tendance a faire des calcules d'urate, ou aussi les chiens prenant de l'Allopurinol ou tout autre produit du meme type pour la leishmaniose. Surdosage ? Non pas vraiment il en faudrait 20 fois la dose journalière sur une certaine période pour poser un problème, et si votre chien ou chat mange le contenu de la boite, au pire il aura une belle diarrhée. DOSAGE 50mg par tranche de 1kg de poids corporel, par jour, en cures de 10 a 21 jours max, en fonction du but recherché. Si vous la donnez en poudre, 1 CaC = 2g (soit la dose pour un animal de 40kg) Une autre facon d'en donner a vos chiens ou chats, c'est de suivre le principe de zoopharmacognosie (auto-medication animale), et le laisser en consommer autant qu'il veut. Pour cela, je dilue un peu de spiruline dans de l'eau (attention ca colle partout a la cuiller) et je le leur offre. Ma femelle en consomme une assez grande quantité, style 10 a 12g par session (2 ou 3 fois la semaine), soit 6 a 7 fois la dose pour son poids. Son pelage n'a jamais été aussi doux et brillant et elle semble attirer beaucoup moins les tiques. QUELQUES RECETTES GOURMANDES 1. Carrés croquants à la spiruline et aux amandes : 30g de noix de coco bio râpée crue 2 cuillers à soupe de spiruline en poudre 1 cuiller a soupe d'huile de coco bio pressée à froid 2 cuillers à soupe de d’amandes crues bio en poudre Les amandes crues étant en général vendues entières, réduisez-les en poudre, ou dans un moulin a épices (j’utilise un vieux moulin à café électrique), ou au mortier. Mélangez tous les ingrédients, et si la pâte est trop épaisse et a du mal à former une boule, vous pouvez rajouter un peu d’eau. Etalez votre pâte sur du papier sulfurisé sur environ 5 bons millimètres d’épaisseur. Avec un objet pas trop coupant, formez des carrés de 2cm de côté, et mettez au déshydrateur a la température la plus basse possible. Laissez déshydrater jusqu’à ce que vos biscuits soient bien croquants (une bonne dizaine d'heures, voir 12), les chiens adorent quand ça croustille ! 2. Chips banane spiruline 1 cuillère à soupe de spiruline 3 bananes 30g de graines de sésame biologiques crues, de graines de lin, ou de graines de citrouilles bio grossièrement concassées. 60g de copeaux de noix de coco bio 2 cuillères à soupe d'huile de noix de coco (fondue) Ecrasez les bananes à la fourchette et mélangez et la spiruline, ou mettez le tout dans un mixeur. Ajoutez les graines de sésame et l’huile de noix de coco fondue, puis les copeaux de noix de coco. Etalez sur du papier sulfurisé ou sur une feuille pour déshydrateur, sur un bon 5mm d’épaisseur, et faites des petites chips carrées d’environ 2cm ; faites déshydrater à basse température 10 à 12 heures, ou jusqu’à ce que vos chips soient croquants. 3. Bonbons gélifiés a la spiruline 250ml de bouillon d'os maison selon notre recette (Le Fameux Bouillon d'Os de VMN 50g de spiruline en poudre ou en paillettes 3 ou 4 feuilles de gélatine) Faites tremper les feuilles de gélatine dans un bol d'eau froide pendant 15 a 20mn. Faites chauffer votre bouillon d'os sans qu'il soit bouillon (environ 70 degrés) puis jetez y les feuilles de gélatine préalablement égouttées et essorées avec vos doigts. Mélangez jusqu\\a ce que la gélatine soit entierement dissoute. Laisser refroidir a environ 40 degrés, puis ajoutez la spiruline. Bien mélanger et verser dans de petits moules en silicone. Vous pouvez ne pas utiliser de gélatine si vous faites réduire votre bouillon de moitié, mais vous aurez besoin de la meme quantité finale que dans la recette. Une autre alternative est de faire ces memes bonbons avec de l'huile de noix de coco. En été vous pouvez les donner congelés.

This one began like most others—first as a compilation of research, expressed knowledge, and the inspiration and ideas of an author or two. But now after many years have passed and many thousands of peo- ple have read, shared, used, and reflected on the content from its pages, this book has grown into something much more—something far greater than anything I ever expected. For many, Herbs for Pets has become a gold standard—the definitive guide to herbs for pets. But it is not the authors, nor even the information contained in its pages, that stand at the forefront of this book’s resounding success. It’s the growing audiences of pet loving people who are realizing that the biggest rewards of animal companionship can come only after we learn to accept and respect the true nature of our animals. Without people like you, this latest edition would not exist. Thank you. And once again—thank you to my now ex-wife and forever friend, Mary, who remains one of my foremost herbalist teachers. Thanks also go to Nancy Kerns, editor of Whole Dog Journal magazine, who throughout the years has been keeping the “holistic word” alive and visible to so many like-hearted animal lovers. And thanks to my dear friend Ikuko Kanada, who not only translated this tome into Japanese but also has been at the forefront of a new natural pet care revolution in Japan; your work brings renewed hope and inspiration to all who truly care about animal wellness. Thank you to Gail Pope and all of the incredible people at Brighthaven Sanctuary—a place where, because of you, miracles really do happen. A special thanks to all of you who came to our rescue when my home burned in the Montana fires of 2000. There is absolutely nothing to describe the feelings of love coming from so many people. And of course, thank you to all of the wonderful holistic veterinarians and natural pet-care providers who work on the front lines to bring the gifts of human intellect, love, and compassion to the true innocents of the world: the animals. —Greg L. Tilford Acknowledgments I would like to thank and acknowledge my parents, George and Dixie Wulff for allow- ing me to be who I am and for letting Uncle Eldon give me my first puppy; Cindy Nicholls, a dear friend; Jan Newman, my cousin and friend: Jeanie Notti-Fullerton, a dear friend who shares a deep love and devotion for all creatures; to all of my animals past and present, for sharing their love and lives with me: Mister, Max, Mollie, Cedar, Willow, Stephanie, all gone but in my heart forever; Sage, the new Heeler in my life; Lili, the new cat in my life; and to Frog (the Doberman) and Kyra, the Shepherd; to my ex-husband, Greg, who made this book and many things possible, thank you for being a good friend. —Mary L. Wulff Herbs and animals have lived together for a long, long time. Millions of years before the first human walked the earth, creatures large and small were using plants as their primary source of healing. In fact, much of our modern medicine originates from what early humans learned through observation of wild ani- mals and their instinctive uses of plants. For instance, we know that Indian tribes of the western United States learned of the powerful antimicrobial properties of Ligusticum porteri by observing bears ingest and roll in the plants to heal themselves. Even today, the plant is still known by many as “bear medicine.” In the face of diseases such as AIDS and cancer, modern-day pharmaceutical researchers continue to scour the remaining wilds of our planet in search of cures, and once again we are turning to the animals for answers. Zoopharmacognosy, a new dis- cipline of science that investigates how animals use plants to heal themselves, is attracting attention at leading research universities throughout the world. At the fore- front of the zoopharmacognosy effort are Dr. Eloy Rodriguez, a biochemist specializ- ing in natural products and synthetic chemistry, and Harvard primatologist Richard Wrangham, who has been studying chimpanzees and gorillas in their native African habitats. Rodriguez and Wrangham have discovered that the apes have an innate abil- ity to select specific plant species for use against internal parasites. In fact, not only can the animals select plants that possess specific medicinal compounds that are effec- tive at expelling their parasites but somehow they know exactly how much plant material is needed to initiate a cure without causing toxic side effects. As zoopharmacognosy recaptures our attention and as our respect toward the healing wisdom of animals grows, our quest for herbal curative answers is becoming more urgent. But we’re faced with a problem. Strains of bacteria once thought to be conquered are reemerging despite our antibiotics, and healing resources are disap- pearing faster than we can discover them. Tens of thousands of acres of wild lands are lost each day to the effects of a growing human population and the relentless demands we place upon the planet. The Smithsonian Institution and fifteen other research organizations recently completed a twenty-year study that concluded that at Introduction least one in every eight plant species worldwide are currently at risk of becoming extinct. In North America alone, it is estimat- ed that 29 percent of sixteen thousand plant species are on the verge of disap- pearing forever—and with each loss, a vital connecting link between earth and all the creatures who walk her ground is being broken forever. As scientists struggle to find cures before plants are eliminated from the face of the planet, a tremendous “green revolution” is under way. A growing number of people are coming to realize that much of the healing wisdom we seek rests not in science and technology but within the ancient healing traditions of nature itself. To access this awareness, we find ourselves turning to the aborig- inal peoples (who adopted healing ways from observing animals) to relearn ways of healing that have been passed down through hundreds of generations from humankind’s oldest teachers—the animals. Ancient cultures knew that healthful living, healing, and good medicine are not gauged by how effectively people can exploit the medicinal properties of natural resources. Instead, shamans and medicine women of the past saw human health as an integral part of the living celestial body we have since grown to know as Earth. They knew that our gravest ills emanate not from what nature bestows upon us but from what we bestow upon nature. This message is being repeated to us everywhere in the form of ancient bacteria, once thought to be conquered, that are mutating into stronger, more resistant, more aggressive strains of infectious disease. Vaccines that we once viewed as miracle medicines are now thought to debilitate the immune sys- tem they were designed to support and protect. Heart disease, cancer, arthritis, osteo- porosis, and even psychosis-driven murder are being linked to the stresses of modern society and the nutrition-depleted foods we eat. Violent rainstorms of unprecedented ferocity wreak havoc as a by-product of air pollution and the effects of global warm- ing. You may ask, how is all of this relevant to a book about herbal animal care? The answer: in the most fundamental ways imaginable. This book introduces you to hundreds of plant medicines that can be used in the daily care of animals. In the first chapters, you learn the importance of feeding your companion a natural whole-foods diet. Then step by step you are guided into new levels of self-reliance as you learn to select, prepare, and apply natural remedies, many of which may be as accessible as your own backyard, on behalf of your Herbs for Pets 10 companion animal. To help overcome possible skepticism, we have provided references to hundreds of cutting-edge scientific studies that support the effec- tiveness of herbs in animals. But even more significant to the purposes of this book, we share what herbalists and animals have learned in the absence of science (without the cruel inhumanities of animal testing) from thousands of years of continuously safe and effective herb use. However, all of this represents the lesser side of what this book has to offer. Our deepest wish is to pass on the sense of interconnectedness that grows within the heart of the healer, as he or she learns and accepts ancient ways of heal- ing that have been utilized by all life- forms on earth. This is not just a book about finding alternatives to conven- tional drugs; it is one about honoring and supporting a system of health care and healing that far exceeds the effectiveness of any medicine devised by humans—a sys- tem contained in and shared among the bodies of animals, plants, and Mother Earth herself. In nature, plants represent much more than containers of active chemical con- stituents that have been identified and validated by the halls of human science. They are healing delegates of nature’s design, here to serve the needs of all creatures who benefit from the nectar of their flowers, the shelter of their leaves, and the healing powers they hold. They are the critical link between what is alive and what is not, pro- viding us and other organisms with the oxygen that is necessary for life and the base elements of the food chain—from macrobiotic soil nutrients to the vegetables on our dinner plates. Yet most people see plants as humanity’s gift: insignificant by virtue of their silence but powerful and valuable when their secrets are revealed by science. Likewise, most of humanity still sees animals as expendable, lower forms of life that exist without intelligent consciousness or emotional pain and that offer no resistance when exploited. In the minds of millions of people, plants and animals are here for the sole purpose of serving us, as fruits and beasts of burden without equal rights, in the pursuit of health and happiness. Whether it be a feedlot steer or a companion German shepherd dog, the needs of most animals become secondary concerns when we are buying pet food at the grocery store or when a chronic immune system disorder erupts into a house- hold flea infestation. Instead of addressing their pet’s real needs, many pet owners are Introduction 11 predisposed to remain focused on themselves—the grocery bill dictates the quality of nutrition their animals receive, and fleas are approached as something that invades our homes, rather than as a symptom of a weakened animal host. With Herbs for Pets, we hope to precipitate a change in this paradigm. The fact that you are reading this book implies that you are not like most people—in fact, you are part of a growing community of special human beings who are on a healing path that leads to something much more significant than the simple joy derived from opening up a can of cat food for the cat or giving the family dog rawhides to keep him busy. Like us, the authors of this book, you have probably discovered that caring for an ani- mal brings about a very special and powerful type of healing. When we provide our companion animals with considerations of health and heal- ing that meet their needs and not just our own, we are in effect healing ourselves as well. In fact, we are healing one of the primary causes of earth’s greatest ills: human- ity’s disconnection from nature. Somewhere in the history of our species we have chosen a relationship of con- sumption and control rather than of coexistence with our planet, and it seems that our goal has been to defeat or defy nature at all costs. We defy nature’s mechanisms of resisting disease by suppressing or bypassing the immune system with corticos- teroid drugs, antibiotics, and vaccines. We ignore the natural requirements of good nutrition by supplementing an unhealthy diet with vitamin tablets. We dam rivers and drain swamps; we even try to change the duration of daylight by resetting the clocks for “daylight saving time.” To compound all of this heady nonsense, we have placed our own self-imposed needs far above those of our earthly neighbors, and as a result the entire planet is suffering. For much too long, the human condition has prohibit- ed us from living in harmony with the natural world that surrounds us. The key to changing this trend rests not in the halls of science but in our willing- ness to see nature as nature is. Instead of studying the nature of plants from a mind- set that insists on picking their chemistries apart in an arrogant attempt to find singu- lar compounds that may be exploited as drugs, we must learn to examine plants as they exist in nature, to discover and explore the intermingled relationships they share with the physical and nonphysical needs of all living things on earth. Likewise, instead of subjecting our animals, our most ancient teachers, to unthinkable pain and torture in a quest for rational answers to satisfy our scientific needs, we must learn to accept nature’s medicines simply as nature presents them. The reality is that the need for sci- entific validation is shared only among humans—no other life-form on earth insists on analyzing and rationalizing nature’s design, especially at the cold-hearted expense of animal suffering. In essence, science is merely striving to rationalize what has been known throughout the natural realm for eons. This is a book about a level of healing that reaches far beyond that which can be provided by science. It is about holistic healing in its truest sense—a process that does not begin or end with the administration of a medicine but with our connection to nature. Holistic healing is not something that is given or received between caregiver and patient—it is part of a continuous circle that is shared among all entities involved Herbs for Pets 12 in the maintenance of health. Our planet provides the elements from which plants are born and must reproduce. The animals and insects serve as stewards for the plants and in turn pass their intuitive wisdom to us. However, to access this wisdom, we must rethink our ways—we must relearn how to give for all that we receive from nature, and we must pay attention to the quiet lessons that surround us in the circle of life. As someone who cares for a companion animal, you have taken a fundamental step back toward the circle of life by accepting a part of nature into your home. Now, as you investigate the healing power of nature’s oldest medicines, and as you learn how to honor your companion’s innate system of health maintenance, you will find yourself stepping into the circle. Here you will find that animals are not human property but are among our most valued teachers and healers. You will see that from the moment a puppy, a kitten, a baby bird, or another companion animal enters a human life, a special bond with nature begins. From this bond we can learn innocence, compassion, respect, unconditional love, and the tragedy of time wast- ed. And most important of all, we can finally realize that despite centuries of our abuses, animals and plants remain quietly waiting to reconnect humankind with the ways of nature. In return for these offerings, and to assure that the circle remains unbroken by our presence, we must give something equally precious back to our beloved companions and teachers: we must listen to them and help serve their needs by providing the nat- ural foods and medicines that have sustained their kind for millions of years. Introduction 13 The holistic herbalist looks beyond the symptoms of disease to identify and correct their underlying causes. Using Herbs Naturally Old ways die hard—especially when we have been raised with them. In our soci- ety, mainstream approaches to health maintenance focus on symptomatic inter- vention. Typically, when a person or animal gets sick, the conventional practi- tioner works to identify and suppress uncomfortable or unsightly symptoms in order to achieve immediate relief. As children, most of us are taught time and again to confront fever with pain relievers such as aspirin, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen; dandruff with shampoos; and constipation with laxatives. But what about the causes of these discomforts? Are we really taking a cura- tive approach toward a fever if we don’t recognize its origin and its purpose? Why do we have dandruff anyway? Why are our animals suffering with chronic constipation? These are questions that are addressed by the holistic herbalist— one who looks at the body as an entire, intricately balanced biocommunity of countless organs, chemicals, microorganisms, and life energies. From a holistic perspective, the herbalist realizes that all body functions are interdependent and that physical or emotional discomforts do not represent the totality of a health crisis but only the body’s conveyance of an underlying imbalance or crisis—a state of “dis-ease.” Unlike conventional Western medicine, the focus of holistic healing is not to kill or cut out disease as it occurs, but to reestablish and maintain holistic home- ostasis, the state of harmonious balance and rhythm among mind, body, spirit, and environment. For most of us, this involves putting some old predispositions aside, revving up the imagination, and engaging in some open-minded obser- vation. We don’t need bioscience degrees to embrace the principles of effective herbalism, but we are required to view health and healing from a much deeper perspective—one that takes into account not only the discomforts of disease but Principles and Practices of Herbalism Principles & Practices Chapter 1 Herbs for Pets 16 AAFCO: Association of American Feed Control Officials ACTH: adrenocorticotropic hormone AIDS: acquired immune deficiency syndrome ASPCA: American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals AVMA: American Veterinary Medical Association BHA: butylated hydroxyanisole BHT: butylated hydroxytoluene CHV: canine herpes virus CoQ10: coenzyme Q10 CPR: cardiopulmonary resuscitation DLE: discoid lupus erythematosus EFA: essential fatty acid FDA: Food and Drug Administration FeLV: feline leukemia virus FIP: feline infectious peritonitis FIV: feline immunodeficiency virus (also known as feline AIDS) FUS: feline urinary syndrome FVR: feline viral rhinotracheitis F: Fahrenheit FLUTD: feline lower urinary tract disease GABA: gamma-aminobutyric acid GBE: ginkgo biloba extract GI: gastrointestinal GLA: gamma-linolenic acid G6PD: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase GST: glutathione S-transferase HCl: hydrochloride HCM: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy HSV: herpes simplex virus IU: international unit MAOI: monoamine oxidase inhibitor NDGA: nordihydroguaiaretic acid PABA: para-amino benzoic acid PAF: platelet aggregating factor PAs: pyrrolizidine alkaloids PDA: patent ductus arteriosus RDA: recommended daily allowance sp.: species (singular/not specified) spp.: species (plural) TCM: traditional Chinese medicine TSH: thyroid stimulating hormone TTouch: Tellington Touch LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS also the totality of wellness. From this perspective, for example, smoking is not a cause of lung cancer but a by-product of whatever prompts us to smoke in the first place. Cigarettes are only a mechanism of cellular destruction, and the tumors they feed are the end products of something insidious that lies within the psyche of the host. It is that “something” that allows us to abandon our well-being in favor of an addictive habit we all know is bad for us, and it is from this level that the heal- ing process must begin. Although this bit of holistic philoso- phy may sound simple, it is fundamen- tally broader than Western orthodox medicine, which centers on intervention and subsequent suppression of disease symptoms. Western society is spoiled by the concept of making problems go away quickly so we can get on with life. Rather than taking the longer route toward finding a true cure, the conven- tional goal is to find a quick-fix solution to the inconveniences of a crisis. Herbs are often employed in much the same capacity. The greatest healing potential of herbs, however, emanates not from their uses as natural drug alternatives but from the holistic principles and philoso- phies that enable us to use them in sup- port of the natural healing mechanisms of the body. The holistic herbalist looks beyond the symptoms of disease to identify and correct their underlying causes. An herbalist strives to understand the har- monious checks and balances that are required among all physical and non- physical aspects of mind, body, spirit, and environment. At the core of this tightly orchestrated synergy, we find a continual need for complete nutrition because a body must have the fuel and tools it needs to build, maintain, and repair itself. In the absence of complete nutrition, necessary tools and building blocks are missing, and the body lacks the resources to make repairs and correct imbalances. In addition to complete nutrition, a body sometimes requires a specialized source of stimula- tion or systemic support in order to maintain a state of health and well- being. This is where herbs come in. The holistic herbalist employs the chemical and energetic properties of plants to help bridge the gaps between what a body receives from complete nutrition and what it requires from time to time in terms of supplemental sup- port. In this holistic context, herbs are used to stimulate, regulate, or adjust natural body functions back into healthy harmony with the rest of the body. The therapeutic effort is directed not at treating disease but at support- ing the body in its efforts to correct the problem itself. In other words, herbs are used to assist the body naturally at what it is designed to do: stay healthy. For many people, allowing the body to cor- rect itself may not be easy because this requires trust in something that still baf- fles our greatest scientists: the body’s remarkable, almost miraculous, ability to take care of itself. A liv- ing body, be it animal or human, represents a sys- tem of healing and health maintenance more effi- cient than anything devised by human intel- lect. To allow herbs to work at their optimum potential, the herb user must respect and honor the healing powers with which we were all born. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 17 Herbs for Pets 18 The Many Faces of Herbal Medicine Many of the plants we use in Western herbalism are identical to those used in other modalities of herbal medicine. But the philosophies of how an herb inter- acts with the mind, body, or spirit tend to vary greatly from culture to culture. Here are some brief descriptions of three of the most popular forms of holistic medicine in which herbs are commonly employed. • Ayurvedic Medicine In India and adjacent areas of the Middle East, ayurveda has prevailed as the primary modality of healing for thousands of years. Ayurvedic medicine focuses on recognizing the doshas, the metabolic body type of an individual. The first step in ayurvedic healing is to identify the specific strengths, suscepti- bilities, and tendencies of the patient from a broad perspective and to take into account the entire constitution of the individual. Once these are identi- fied, herbs, diet, meditation, or other mechanisms are used to bring the constitution of the individual back into harmonious balance with all ele- ments of the mind, body, spirit, and environment. • Traditional Chinese Medicine Herbs have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for at least seven thousand years. Many principles of TCM are similar to those of ayurvedic medicine. The primary dif- ference is in how the body is viewed in terms of channels, rivers, winds, and energetic flows in TCM. In other Traditional herbal cabinet at a Chinese pharmacy words, the body is seen as a reflection of nature, and practitioners look for energetic blockages or disruptions— dampness, dryness, hot or cold winds, or bank breaches in the flow of qi (pro- nounced “chee”), the life force. The physical body is also viewed as a set of balanced polarities: yin, which gener- ally refers to the tissues of the body organs, and yang, the activity of the organs. Yin and yang are opposites that cannot work independently of one another. If a yin deficiency occurs, it is because the body does not have proper nutrients or adequate physical structure to perform its functions. If a yang deficiency occurs, the body can- not react to metabolic stimuli. In TCM, herbs are used to assist and maintain proper energetic flows and polarities in the body. • Western Herbalism In contrast, Western herbalism seems almost superficial in nature. Western herbalism originates from ancient uses of medicinal plants in Europe. Many of the principles, philosophies, and cer- tainly our validations of how herbs are used to effect healing are constantly evolving in this form of herbalism. For instance, the spirituality of the healer, the patient, and even the herb itself was once the primary focus of herbal medicine in ancient Europe. But today, Western herbalists incorporate many philosophies, including scientific vali- dation of photochemical compounds, plant energetics, folkloric accounts and belief systems, and several other points of opinion. As Western herbalists, we base our use of herbs on a balance of all philosophies. We respect and admire recent scientific validations of medici- nal plant chemistries, but we also strongly believe that plants contain synergistic balances of chemical, ener- getic, and perhaps spiritual elements that make them unique and unex- plainable. We see a great deal of value in much of the anecdotal evidence that has been handed down regarding the traditional uses of herbs over the past few millennia. Although scientific studies have failed to validate many of the claims that have been passed down through the ages, the fact that many of these customs have worked safely and effectively for thousands of people throughout several centuries is certainly convincing to us. But despite differences in opinion, most Western herbalists share a similar, holistic per- spective when it comes to doing the actual work of healing. The body is viewed from a bio- logical perspective but with a focus that takes into account the totality of the individual. While mainstream modalities of Western medicine focus primarily on the treatment of disease and suppression of symptoms with little regard to cause, the herbalist works from the opposite direction. While working to promote health by addressing the underlying causes and providing aid to the body’s efforts, the Western herbalist views the body as a tightly knit biosystem of organs, cooperative cells, microbes, enzymes, nutrients, and synergistic energies that must be maintained in a state of cooperative balance. During a disease crisis, herbs are utilized to strengthen or stimulate the body’s natural func- tions at chemical and energetic levels so that a state of health can be reestablished quickly and efficiently. After the crisis is over, herbal tonics may then be used to strengthen body functions that are chronically deficient to avoid reoccurrence. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 19 Herbs for Pets 20 While the philosophies that lead people to the use of herbal medicines are variable worldwide, all modalities of herbal healing share two fundamental similarities. One is that the therapeutic focus is holistic, taking into account the totality of the individual instead of the symptoms of disease only. The other is that all good herbalists know that herbs work best in a proactive capacity when employed from a perspective that rec- ognizes health maintenance as the paramount cure for disease. HERBS AS ALTERNATIVES TO CONVENTIONAL MEDICINES Many of us are introduced to the realm of herbal medicine by using herbs as direct replacements for over-the-count- er or prescription drugs. Like drugs, herbs can be used to treat the symp- toms of disease effectively. Unlike many drugs, herbs are relatively safe and gen- tle medicines—they are very forgiving, offering a much greater margin of error and fewer adverse side effects. Most drugs are composed of specif- ic chemical compounds that have been isolated from their source and concen- trated to maximum potency. A medici- nal plant, however, consists of dozens, sometimes thousands, of interactive or inert chemical components. Many skeptics argue that herbal medicines are less effective and unsafe because the concentrations of active con- stituents are too low and are variable from plant to plant. To the herbalist, the presence of sci- entifically proven compounds is only Herb Substitute Uses HERBS THAT ARE FREQUENTLY USED AS SUBSTITUTES FOR CONVENTIONAL DRUGS Licorice (Glycyrrhiza glabra) Used as an anti-inflammatory alternative to yucca root (Yucca schidigera), steroidal, and nonsteroidal drugs Black walnut (Juglans nigra) Used in place of conventional wormers Wormwood (Artemisia absinthium) Saint-John’s-wort (Hypericum spp.) Used as a natural substitute for Prozac (fluoxetine HCl) Oregon grape (Mahonia spp.) Used as an antibiotic for eyes, ears, and mucous membranes Valerian (Valeriana officinalis) Skullcap (Scutellaria laterifolia) Used as alternatives to sedative drugs Passionflower (Passiflora incarnata) Hop (Humulus lupulus) Dandelion leaf (Taraxacum officinale) Used in place of furosemide (Lasix) Senna (Cassia angustifolia) Used as a natural laxative part of what makes a plant useful. Instead of focusing on isolated chemical components, the herbalist accepts the inexplicable synergy that exists among all components of a plant’s chemistry and all components of the physical and nonphysical recipient. In the mind of the herbalist, this is what makes herbal medicine safe, effective, and unique. The whole plant is always greater, and usual- ly safer, than the sum of its parts. For those who are trying to break away from conventional ways of think- ing, this concept of holistic synergy can be difficult to grasp. Having been raised and trained in a science-based culture, accepting something that cannot be fully rationalized can be difficult. But to put things into a scientific perspective, let’s look at thymol, the primary active constituent of thyme (Thymus spp.). Thymol is potentially toxic when iso- lated from the rest of the thyme plant. But when employed as part of the whole plant in a tincture or tea, thymol serves as an active part of a safe and effective antimicrobial, dewormer, and cough suppressant medicine. Anybody from any discipline of sci- ence can pick up a simple herbal remedy and use it for the purpose of treating ill- ness. It’s really very easy to substitute many of the favored conventional medi- cines with herbal remedies. But here are a few important things to remember. • Keep in mind that herbs are slower acting than most drugs. Expectation of rapid results is perhaps the greatest cause of frustration and failure among would-be herbalists. The dif- ference between a successful herbal therapy and resorting to a shot of, say, prednisolone often amounts to a day or two of patient waiting. • When using herbs as direct replace- ments for allopathic medicines, don’t expect results beyond those you would expect from the drugs you are replacing. The only difference in ther- apy when using herbs as drug substi- tutes is the medicinal device; the cur- ative depth of the therapy remains the same. • If you opt to use herbs symptomati- cally, it is important to remember that you will likely end up dis- couraged if you expect to find a cure. For example, when treating conjunc- tivitis that is second- ary to bacterial infec- tion, a combination eyewash of Oregon grape (Mahonia aqui- folium), raspberry leaf (Rubus idaeus), and ster- ile saline will effectively replace most conventional ophthalmic preparations— but just like a conventional preparation, the herbs won’t address the underlying causes of a chronic problem. HERB ACTIONS AND SPECIAL AFFINITIES It is unrealistic to think a full conveyance of effective herbal wisdom can be con- tained in this book, but a large measure of awareness can be perpetuated by embracing a basic understanding of how each of these plants works within the body. In Western herbalism, the effects that plant materials have in or on the body are called “medicinal actions” or “active properties.” By becoming famil- iar with the medicinal actions of the herbs to which you have access, you will have a good idea where to look for an appropriate course of therapy when a need for one arises. In addition to know- ing the manner by which herbs work in the body, it is also important to begin Principles and Practices of Herbalism 21 Herbs for Pets 22 A BASIC START-UP APOTHECARY FOR VETERINARY APPLICATIONS All of the herbs in this table are generally safe, well validated, and easy to use in a wide variety of veterinary applications.

For instance, we may know that slippery elm has a general astringent action (meaning that it shrinks tissues), but its effective usefulness can be really pronounced when we know that it has a special affin- ity to the digestive tract, where its astrin- gent actions are particularly well suited to shrinking the inner wall of the small intestine to relieve diarrhea and other discomforts. DOSAGE AND DURATION OF THERAPY The dosage suggestions provided in this book represent what we feel are safe and conservative starting points for use in most animals. The exact dosage and duration of an herb therapy that your companion may need depends on the animal’s specific needs, tolerances, and metabolism. In other words, the answers to how much and for how long may vary from animal to animal. Some animals respond favorably to very small doses— perhaps just a drop or two of tincture. Others require larger doses or may not respond to certain herbs at all (as you know, such is the case with drugs too). Therefore, a conservative starting point for administration of herb extracts, infusions, or dried herbs in dogs, cats, and herbivores is to use only one or two herbs at a time and to proportion the dosage based on the animal’s body weight compared to the recommended human dosage. For example, a 30-pound dog would receive one-fifth of that which is rec- ommended for a 150-pound human. Also to be considered is your veterinar- ian’s opinion, a reputable reference book, or the product manufacturer’s recommendations. Remember, this is just a starting point. Dogs, cats, and other carnivores have much faster metabolic rates than we do; therefore, initial dosages might have to be increased later to achieve the results you are looking for. The biggest mistake is to think of dosing in terms of absolutes. Instead, watch the animal you are treating; read up on the side effects, contraindications, and active nature of the herbs you are using; and don’t hesitate to change dosages. If you need to increase a dosage, do so in 10 percent increments to a maximum of 50 percent above the starting dose. In other words, if you have determined that the starting dose for “Max” is 20 drops of burdock, twice daily, then you can increase the dose 2 drops at a time until you reach 30 drops, if necessary. If a dosage needs to be decreased (if, for example, valerian causes acute vomiting in your cat), cut the dose in half. If you feel it’s neces- sary, stop the therapy altogether for a day or two, and let the animal’s body readjust before proceeding with the reduced dosage. Most animals require a dose two to three times daily. The duration of an herbal therapy also depends on the specific animal and varies according to the disease you are confronting. Generally, it is best to take at least a two-day break from herbal therapies each week (five days on, two days off). This allows you to monitor the animal’s responses to the herbs and to alleviate any tolerance or toxicity prob- lems she may otherwise develop as a result of long-term use. The duration required to see results varies greatly and is dependent on the nature of the herb, the animal, and the severity of the imbalance you are confronting. If results don’t begin to materialize after Herbs for Pets 26 you have maintained a maximum dosage schedule for more than seven days, it may be time to try another herb or to consult your holistic veterinarian. In any case, keep detailed records of your successes, failures, and observa- tions. Exactly how long to maintain an herbal therapy can be determined only through experience and familiarity with your animal, and good record keeping is instrumental to becoming an effective herbalist. A Few Words About Toxicity Serious adverse reactions are rare, but when used outside the parameters of common sense and moderation, any plant can be toxic. Toxicity is dose dependent, relative to the rate of absorption and the individ- ual’s ability to assimilate or eliminate an excess. If a body receives a substance in quantities or concentrations that cannot be effectively dealt with by its natural functions, the excess must be dealt with by emergency means. Vomiting, diar- rhea, and other purgative functions are then triggered to eliminate the invasive substance(s). If this fails, systemic shut- down or damage may occur. Most herbs that are commonly used in veterinary medicine are safe and for- giving—in most cases in which an ani- mal is hypersensitive to an herb or has received too much, she will vomit short- ly after administration. Other common indicators of toxicity include itching, photosensitivity, and diarrhea. The key word in the avoidance of toxic reactions is moderation. Although herbs are generally weaker and gentler medicines than most drugs, they still demand respect. “More” is not necessar- ily “better,” even in the employment of nutritive “food-medicine” herbs such as nettle (Urtica spp.), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), or flaxseed (Linum spp.). All of these herbs may cause digestive upset and dermatological reactions if fed to the animal in large quantities. Aside from the issues of overdose and prolonged use, it is important to remember that some animals may have allergies to certain herbs; a few are especially sensitive to certain plant sub- stances; and some have preexisting con- ditions. Therefore, to be safe, it’s always a good idea to proceed with caution. Start with a small dose, and watch the animal for any signs of adverse reaction. When to Take Your Pet to the Vet This book is aimed at enabling you to be somewhat self-sufficient in ensuring the health and welfare of your com- panion animals. However, there are some problems that caregivers should not attempt to treat on their own at home. Some of these include life-threatening situa- tions such as poison- ings; major traumas such as those caused by being hit by a car; bleeding; broken bones; instances when the con- dition you’re treating at home doesn’t get better in a few days; and cases in which there are ques- tions or other avenues of treatment to be taken. Most of us believe that our animals must be seen by a vet in order to get treatment. In many cases this is true. But holistic vets can’t be found in all areas of the U.S., so it becomes nec- essary for some of us to Principles and Practices of Herbalism 27 Herbs for Pets 28 CAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS The following chart lists a few of the most common types of problematic plant compounds to be aware of in the natural care of animals. This list is intended for the purpose of cau- tious awareness. It is by no means complete, and the presence of one or more of these compounds in a specific herb does not necessarily exclude that herb from safe use. Anthraquinones Anthraquinones, including dianthrone glycosides, sennosides, aloe-emoden, chyso- phanol, among others, are the active laxative constituents that are present in aloe (cer- tain preparations), senna (Cassia senna), cascara sagrada, and turkey rhubarb (Rheum palmatum). Anthraquinones act as laxatives by stimulating intestinal peristalsis and may cause cramping and severe diarrhea if misused. These compounds are hard on the liver and kidneys, and extended use of anthraquinone-bearing herbs may lead to depend- ency. Coumarins Coumarins include coumarin, medicagol, furanocoumarins, among others. Most coumarin-bearing plants do not contain enough coumarins to represent a risk in nor- mal therapeutic doses. Large doses of coumarins, however, can cause photosensitivity. Coumarins are known to thin the blood and may potentiate the effects of anticoagu- lant drugs. Coumarin-rich herbs such as red clover (Trifolium pratense) and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) should not be given to animals with clotting disorders. Oxalic Acid and Oxalates Oxalic acid and oxalates are present in many plants (a small amount is even present in fresh spinach), but can be found especially in members of the Polygonaceae and Cruciferae families. Oxalic acid is characterized by a tart, lemony flavor and is especial- ly evident in the leaves of sheep sorrel (Rumex acetosella) and French sorrel (Rumex scu- tatus). Oxalic acid can cause urinary tract irritation, can deplete the body of vitamin B1, and is known to bind with calcium in the urine—thus potentially causing stones. Although the oxalic acid content of most herbs, such as yellow dock root (Rumex cris- pus), is generally small and usually will not cause a problem with moderately dosed, short-term use (up to fourteen days), it is best to avoid such herbs in cases of preexist- ing kidney or urinary disease. Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids Pyrrolizidine alkaloids are present in many plants but most notably in comfrey (Symphytum officinale). Most PA-bearing plants have received an undeserved bad name; it takes doses that are dozens of times in excess of a therapeutic quantity to cause hepatotoxic effects—especially in a healthy liver. Nonetheless, there are docu- mented cases of liver damage (in both human and animal modalities) as a result of comfrey overuse. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 29 There are hundreds of different alkaloid compounds present in thousands of medicinal plant species—many are generally safe; some present a risk of toxicity. Many present themselves as the primary active constituent of a plant. Perhaps the most frequently employed alkaloid in Western herbal medicine is berberine, the bitter yellow substance that is found in Oregon grape (Mahonia spp.), goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), and a few other plants. Berberine is generally safe, but overuse of berberine-rich plants may overstimulate bile production (especially in cats), resulting in vomiting. Berberine is contraindicated in pregnant or lactating animals. Salicylates Salicylates, including salicylaldehyde, salicin, methyl salicylate, salicylic acid, among others, are the precursors to acetylsalicylate (aspirin). This means that herbs such as willow bark (Salix spp.), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), poplar (Populus spp.), and others must be used with extreme caution in felines or other animals who are sensitive to aspirin. Saponins There are hundreds of different saponin (soaplike) constituents in various plants. Most notably, saponins are among the primary active constituents in valerian (Valeriana offic- inalis), licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.), sarsaparilla (Smilax spp.), and yucca root (Yucca spp.). Saponins are characterized by their foaming, soapy nature. Although they seldom pres- ent any problems, excessive or extended use of saponin-rich herbs can produce GI irri- tation and vomiting, and some may eventually interfere with the absorption of fat-sol- uble vitamins. Sterols Sterols include ß-sitosterol, stigmasterol, ampesterol, among others. Some plants, such as licorice, that contain large concentrations of phytosterols or steroidal saponins can cause problems, such as water retention and hypertension, similar to those presented by steroidal drugs but only if used excessively or over an extended period. The side effects of phytosterols are much harder to procure, and can be largely avoided by occa- sional breaks in the therapy (for example, five days on, two off) and with concurrent use of diuretic herbs such as dandelion leaf and alterative herbs such as dandelion root and burdock. Tannins Tannins such as corilagin pyranoside, ellagic acid, and gallic acid are found in the bark and leaves of many herbs and are the most frequently employed astringents of the plant world. Herbs that are especially tannin rich include uva ursi (Arctostaph los uva- ursi), any part of the juniper (Juniperis spp.) plant, black walnut hulls (Juglans nigra), and white oak bark (Quercus sp.). Tannins are typically used to reduce inflammations of mucous membranes in the digestive and urinary tracts, but if used excessively they can have a reverse effect, causing mucosal irritation. Herbs that contain tannins should not be used in animals with inflammatory kidney disease. Some tannins are labor inducing (oxytocic) and may cause abortion in pregnant animals. consult with a vet over the telephone. Some holistic veterinarians do provide telephone consultations, but many don’t. No matter, it’s wise to have a local vet to whom you can take your animals in case of a major trauma or if surgery is needed. Basics of Herbal Preparations The manner in which an herb is used is determined by a holistic assessment of the particular circumstances at hand and the overall nature of the ani- mal. Once you have investigated the origins of the symptoms that have caught your attention, you can select the medicinal actions you need to confront the problem. This leads you to one or more herbs that have a spe- cific affinity to the body systems that are involved. Choosing the correct herb to fit ther- apeutic circumstances is critical not only to the effective treatment of disease but also to the conservation of botanical resources. Many plant species are cur- rently at risk of extinction because they have been touted as “curative silver bul- lets.” But in reality, there are no cure-all herbs. In fact, no single herb serves as a definitive cure for anything. For an herb to be used effectively and responsibly, it should be used only within the true con- fines of its therapeutic capacity. It also must be used in a form or preparation that is complementary to its medicinal attributes and the task at hand. Each herb’s physical and chemical structures determine how the herb should be prepared and subsequently administered. For instance, many herbs are very water soluble, which means that if you pour hot water over them, Herbs for Pets 30 Volatile Oils Volatile oils include myristicin, apiole, terpineol, sesquiterpenes, menthone, pulegone, piperidinone, thujone, jugulone, 3-octanol, among others. There are hundreds of volatile oil compounds, many of which make up the aromatic principles of a plant, present in thousands of plant species. Menthol, for example, is a volatile oil found in members of the mint family. The medicinal activities and toxicology of volatile oils are widely variable, but most have an effect on the genitourinary and digestive tracts, caus- ing irritation to the kidneys and urinary passages when used in large quantities. Others, such as the pulegone found in pennyroyal (Mentha pulegium) or the myristicin and api- ole found in parsley seed (Petroselinum crispum) and nutmeg seed (Myristica fragrans), are potentially hepatotoxic and nephrotoxic if used in overabundance. Volatile oils have been shown to cross the placenta barrier to adversely affect the fetus of pregnant animals. The s-methyl cysteine sulfoxide and n-propyl disuldhide contained in garlic has been shown to produce Heinz-body anemia, a serious blood disorder, if the cloves are consumed in excess of 0.5 percent of the subject animal’s body weight. This means that a healthy 60-pound dog would have to eat several cloves of garlic just to start the Heinz-body process. The problem is dose dependent, meaning that blood structure quickly normalizes when garlic use is reduced or discontinued. CAUTIONS, CONTRAINDICATIONS, AND POTENTIAL SIDE EFFECTS (CONTINUED) their medicinal constituents quickly and completely infuse into the water, making their desired chemical attrib- utes freely available for the body to absorb and use. Many other herbs, however, are poorly water soluble, which means that if you pour hot water over them to make an infusion, little or nothing of medicinal value is drawn from the plant’s tissues. Following is an introduction to the basic how-tos of making herbal prepa- rations. Those of you who collect books will find that compared to other books on herbal medicines, the guidelines we offer here are loose. We have done this for the sake of practicality and simplici- ty. While exact measurements and strict procedures are necessary meas- ures of quality control in the commer- cial production of herbal products, the self-reliant herbalist really doesn’t have to worry so much about precision. As long as there’s enough herb, a strong- enough solvent, and the correct type of preparation, you will be rewarded with a good, strong herbal medicine. DRIED BULK HERB MATERIAL Dried bulk herbs are handy to have around because they allow for a great deal of diversity in how they can be prepared and applied. In addition to being used in various herb prepara- tions, some dried herbs can be sprin- kled directly onto an animal’s food. As a general rule, roots keep two to three times longer than dried leaf material. But don’t stock up on more than you can use within one year, and be sure to store your herbs in airtight containers that are kept away from sunlight. Regardless of proper storage methods, dried herbs eventually oxidize and lose their potency. A few herbs lose much of their medicinal and nutritive value within days of drying. Buy herbs from an honest, knowledgeable herbalist who knows the origin of his or her mer- chandise, or grow your own herbs to assure optimum potency and shelf life. FRESH HERBS Fresh herbs, clipped, dug, or plucked directly from a garden, are rich in nutrients and medicinal constituents. Provided that their physical nature allows for the form of preparation you need, fresh herbs are without compare in terms of medicinal potency. While most herbs are strong when used fresh, others require at least par- tial drying before they impart their active compo- nents into a useful medium. Cascara sagrada (Rhamnus purshiana) bark is one exam- ple. This herbal laxative is far too strong if used fresh and should be dried for at least a full year to mellow it before use. It is also poorly water solu- ble when fresh, and until it dries it will not infuse adequately in water for a good tea. HERB CAPSULES Because dogs and cats have short diges- tive tracts, encapsulated herbs tend to pass right through them. Even if they don’t, you may find some difficulty in getting a large enough dose into your animal. In horses, sheep, llamas, goats, and other herbivores, capsules work fine—but plan on feeding the animals dozens of them. In these animals, you are often better off feeding the bulk herb or using an extract. ALCOHOL EXTRACTS, OR TINCTURES With few exceptions, an alcohol tincture is by far the most versatile, strongest, and most readily usable form of herb Principles and Practices of Herbalism 31 preparation. It can be administered oral- ly; used in topical applications; diluted with water; or used as part of an eye, hair, or skin rinse. A tincture is prepared by soaking a measured quantity of fresh or dried herb in a certain proportion of alcohol and water, using a specific formula for each herb. The alcohol serves as a solvent that breaks down the plant material and releases the active ingredients into a liq- uid base called a menstruum. After two days to two weeks (depending on the method used) the menstruum is then strained and pressed from the plant material (called the marc), to produce the finished liquid product. Alcohol tinc- tures offer the advantages of maximum potency and unlimited shelf life provided they are stored properly. The concentrated liquid nature of tincture preparations allows for their quick and complete absorption into the body, even in the short digestive tracts of dogs and cats. When kept in 1-ounce dropper bottles, they can be carried any- where and are easy to use. The biggest problem with alcohol tinctures is getting them into an animal. These preparations are typically 30–70 percent grain alco- hol, and while typical dosages do not present any alcohol-toxicity problems, animals truly hate the way they taste. There are two basic methods for making tinctures: one is a process called percolation, the other, simpler method, is called maceration. The per- colation method entails using a specially designed, cone-shaped glass vessel. Herb material is placed into the cone, then the menstruum is poured over it, left to stand for a short while, and eventually allowed to trickle (or percolate) through the plant material and out a tube at the bottom end of the vessel. Making herb tinctures by maceration takes more time, but it is much simpler and requires no specialized equipment. To make a macerated tincture, herb material is placed into a glass jar, plastic container, or other nonmetallic contain- er. The menstruum is poured over the herb and the entire mixture is covered with an airtight lid and allowed to soak for a period of two weeks. The menstru- um is then strained from the plant mate- rial (the marc), to produce the finished liquid product. The proportions of alcohol and water needed to make an herb tincture vary according to the solubility of the herb itself. Some herbs, such as milk thistle seed, require a high percentage of alco- hol to extract optimum quantities of active constituents from their cell struc- tures. Other herbs, such as raspberry leaf, require little or no alcohol to extract their useful compounds. Fortunately, knowing what percentage of alcohol you need is easy because these determina- tions have already been done for you. Most of the formulas used in contempo- rary herbal practice are from the U.S. Pharmacopoeia and other standard refer- ences that have been used in the phar- maceutical production of simple herb Herbs for Pets 32 To make an herb tincture from fresh herbs, add 1 part herb to 2 parts menstruum. extracts throughout most of the twenti- eth century. This information is still used by herbalists and laboratories through- out the world and can be found in sever- al books about herbs and herbalism. The amount of menstruum needed to extract the active constituents from a plant also varies. With most fresh (un- dried) herbs, you will need a 1:2 ratio of herbs to menstruum. Most dried herb materials require a 1:5 ratio. This means that to make a tincture from the fresh root of dandelion, you need one part of chopped herb material (by weight) to two parts of menstruum (by liquid vol- ume). For example, 16 ounces of fresh root must be covered with 32 fluid ounces of menstruum to make a tincture (and the menstruum must be at least 40 percent alcohol). If you are using dried root, 16 ounces of dried root material will require 80 fluid ounces of menstruum to make a tincture. Make sense? Don’t worry if it doesn’t; we’ll simplify in a moment. So how does one make a menstruum? The most accurate and inexpensive way to make a menstruum is to buy pure grain alcohol (brand named Everclear) at a liquor store. Everclear is 95 percent pure grain alcohol (190 proof). For sim- plicity, let’s just call it a pure, 100 percent alcohol. To make a 70 percent alcohol menstruum, we would add 30 percent water to its volume (i.e., add 3 parts water to 7 parts alcohol). If it’s a 50 per- cent menstruum we need, then all we have to do is add an equal (50/50) amount of water. It’s that simple. Unfortunately, Everclear isn’t available in some portions of the U.S., so a medicine maker may have to do some liquor shop- ping. For tinctures that require 70 per- cent alcohol, uncut 151 proof rum works fine (it’s 75 percent alcohol). For a 50 percent menstruum, you can use 100 proof vodka (it’s 50 percent alcohol), and so forth. Now here’s the simplified version of medicine making we promised. Get some fresh or dried herb, chop it up or grind it as fine as possible, put it in a con- tainer, then add enough menstruum (of the appropriate strength) to just barely cover the herb. Cover the container, then let it sit for two weeks, strain the mixture through a cloth, and store the liquid in an airtight glass jar. Amber glass is best because it blocks ultraviolet rays that may damage your tincture. You now have an herb tincture. The primary rule in this simplified method of making tincture is always to use the correct per- centage of alcohol in your menstruum. If you do, you will always end up with a nice tincture by covering a maximum amount of chopped or ground herb with a minimum amount of menstruum. GLYCERIN-BASED HERB EXTRACTS, OR GLYCERITES Glycerites are made essentially the same way as alcohol extracts, but a solution of 60 percent vegetable glycerin and 40 percent water is used in place of alcohol. The big advantage of glyc- erites in animal care is their palatabili- ty—glycerin tastes sweet, with a flavor and consistency similar to light corn syrup. While some glycerin-based extracts are not as potent as their alco- hol counterparts, they allow pet own- ers to get the herbs into their animals in the first place—hence, half the bat- tle is won. Potency can then be adjust- ed by increasing the dosage. Vegetable glycerin is refined from coconut oils, and despite its syrupy-sweet flavor, it is metabolized in a manner similar to that of triglycerides, not sugar. This means it can be used safely in animals with alcohol sensitivity or in those with diabetes. Glycerites do not keep indef- initely but remain viable for at least two years if refrigerated. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 33 The biggest disadvantages of glyc- erites are their limited shelf life (one to two years) and, in many cases, their strength. Glycerin is not as strong a sol- vent as alcohol, and many herbs are not taken up well into a glycerin menstru- um, especially if they are of a resinous nature. However, some herbs, especial- ly those that are highly water soluble, release their active ingredients into glycerin very well. To find out if a partic- ular herb that interests you is good for making glycerites, refer to one or more of the books we recommend at the end of this section. WATER INFUSIONS (HERB TEAS) Infusions are made by steeping a specif- ic quantity of plant material in hot water. The disadvantages of using teas internally for animals are twofold: many animals don’t like tea, and it can be dif- ficult to feed an animal enough tea to bring about therapeutic results. Unlike tinctures, which provide a plant’s active constituents in a highly concentrated, fully assimilable form, teas generally amount to a weaker medicine, and plant compounds that are not water soluble are not imparted to the animal. Infusions are especially useful for skin and coat rinses and as vitamin- and mineral-rich tonic food supplements. When mixed into an animal’s food, an herb tea provides most of what a dried or fresh herb offers in a form that is quickly and more easily absorbed into the body. Herb teas also offer the advantage of melding with the flavor of an animal’s diet without adding a new texture to the food—an important attribute for those who wish to feed nutritive herbs to a finicky feline. DECOCTIONS A decoction is an infusion that requires some gentle simmering to make a strong enough preparation for therapeutic use. Decoction is required of many roots when the plant material is too insoluble Herbs for Pets 34 Then cover the mixture and store for at least one month. Completely cover the herb with olive oil to make an oil infusion. in water to allow a strong enough infu- sion. Decoctions should be prepared using a minimum of heat. Simmer the herb for about fifteen minutes at a tem- perature that is only slightly above the boiling point. Too much heat destroys many of the plant constituents you wish to employ. Decoctions are used in the same manner as water infusions, but they tend to be strong in comparison. OIL INFUSIONS An oil infusion is produced by complete- ly covering an herb with olive oil and allowing it to steep in a covered non- metallic container in a warm location for at least one month. The oil is then pressed out and stored in the refrigerator for up to one year. Although several choices of oil can be used, olive oil pos- sesses its own preservative qualities, is relatively affordable, and is nourishing to the body, both internally and externally. Oil infusions are excellent for topical applications, acting to soothe and pro- tect the affected area while holding the herb constituents at the site where they are applied. Extra caution should be used when applying oil to burns or infected areas because it may seal in heat and bacteria. In these cases, make sure that the possibility of infection has been addressed with a good, clean antimicro- bial preparation and the burn has entirely cooled before anything is applied. POULTICES A poultice is made by mashing plant material (usually dried foliage) with enough water or vegetable oil to make a wet, pesto-like paste. Poultices are good in topical field applications when other preparations are impossible to make. A simple poultice can be applied directly to an animal’s skin, or it can be made into a compress that can be secured onto the animal. To make a compress, wrap the wet poultice in a piece of clean cloth, allowing the liquid to freely soak through the cloth. Wrap the compress onto the affected body part and secure with knots. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 35 Then you can apply the poultice directly to your animal’s skin or fur. To make a poultice, mash the herb with water or vegetable oil until it forms a paste. SALVES AND OINTMENTS Salves and ointments are simply thick- ened oil infusions. In making salves, beeswax is frequently used as the thick- ening agent. The thinner ointment preparations typically employ coconut butter, particularly if the ointments are to be used in suppository applications. The oil infusion is gently heated, and the beeswax or coconut butter is melt- ed into the liquid until the cooled product yields the consistency that is desired. For salves, use a ratio of 1 ounce of beeswax or cocoa butter to 8 ounces of oil. If the salve or ointment turns out to be too thick or thin when it has cooled, gently reheat it and adjust the proportion of beeswax or cocoa butter. Suppository molds and salve tins are available through herb catalogs and at some drugstores. Herbs for Pets 36 To make a fomentation, secure a cloth over the affected area of skin and pour the infusion over it until the cloth is soaked. As with oil infusions, extra caution should be used when applying salves or ointments to areas of the body that are burned or infected. In these cases, make sure that a good, clean antimi- crobial preparation is used and that the burn has cooled completely before applying any kind of topical treatment to the area. FOMENTATIONS A fomentation is used for topical appli- cations where a water or oil infusion must remain on a particular body site for a specific period. Gauze or another cloth material is placed over the area, and the infusion is poured onto the dressing until it is soaked. Mustard packs, castor oil packs, and other tradi- tional remedies employ this method. This is a good approach for horses with fungal infections of the skin or other animals who don’t mind “wearing” an herbal ornament for a while. STANDARDIZED EXTRACTS A standardized extract is more of a plant drug than an herbal medicine. These preparations are made by scientif- ically increasing the content of certain active ingredients in order to bring about specific therapeutic effects. This is done by removing a desired active ingredient from the chemistry of a par- ticular plant species, then adding it back to the extract at much higher con- centration. For example, in nature, milk thistle seeds contain anywhere from 2 percent to 6 percent silymarin, the most medicinally active component of the plant. In cases of severe liver damage or toxicity, a much higher percentage of silymarin may be needed to quickly bring about a therapeutic effect. A milk thistle extract that has been “standard- ized” to as much as 80 percent sily- marin can be used in such cases. On the surface, standardized extracts may seem like a superior form of herbal medicine. In the aforementioned exam- ple in which milk thistle is indicated, this is absolutely true. However, it’s impor- tant to remember that when we stan- dardize an herb we alter its physical and energetic nature. Our manipulation of its nature is based on our scientific understanding of only one or a few of its chemical components. In its natural form, each herb is composed of hun- dreds of chemical components that are arranged in a unique, synergistic man- ner that cannot be replicated by sci- ence. It is this synergy that makes herbs a mysteriously effective form of medicine. Every time that we alter the chemistry of an herb, we change everything that the herb represents in terms of a natural and holistic medi- cine. To the holistic herbalist, the ques- tion is not so much what can be gained by standardizing an herb but rather how much is lost in the process. The bottom line is that standardized extracts are best reserved only for spe- cific indications—they do not represent a complete form of herbal medicine. The Connection between Herbs and Diet To use herbs to the best of their poten- tial, we must take on a holistic per- spective of health and healing that views all components of mind, body, spirit, and environment as equal parts of an individual’s well-being. At the core of this “whole body” perspective is a good diet. Without balanced nutri- tion, the use of herbal medicines in the holistic care of your animal is a waste of time, money, and plants. The food that your animal eats should provide all of the nutritional components that are necessary for all organs and systems of a healthy body Principles and Practices of Herbalism 37 to perform in harmonious unison. A properly functioning body does an amazing job of preventing disease and healing itself, and to do this it requires the energies and nutrients of a well- balanced diet. However, sometimes the body needs special measures of outside support to optimize its healing efforts to assist the body at working harder, faster, longer, or more efficiently toward reestablishing a balanced state of holistic health. Enter herbs. In the holistic context in which they are used most effectively, herbs serve as functional adjuncts to good nutri- tion by helping the body to use its innate and acquired resources more effectively. For example, echinacea does not act as a substitute for the body’s immune system but serves to stimulate the body’s natural defenses into working harder, thus boosting the body’s abilities to resist infection. Likewise, herbs such as dandelion root, Oregon grape, and burdock assist in the elimination of waste from the body by stimulating the liver and gallbladder into working more efficiently. These supportive functions are diet depend- ent: in order for an herb to call upon the body to do something extraordi- nary, there must be an adequate store of energy and building materials with which the body can work. Herbs for Pets 38 A GENERAL HERBAL DIETARY ADJUNCT Combine equal parts of the following: spirulina nettle dandelion leaf alfalfa powdered flaxseed This formula can be fed at a rate of 1 teaspoon per pound of food fed daily ( 1⁄2 teaspoon daily for cats) as an adjunct to a natural diet. While it may not fill all of an animal’s sup- plemental nutrition needs, it will complement his diet with foodlike concentrations of fully assimilable protein, vitamin C, B complex (including B12), vitamin A (beta- carotene), vitamin E, vitamin K, iron, potassium, calcium, phospho- rus, magnesium, and omega-3 fatty acids. Nettle is a good source of potassium. Dandelion flowers are rich in lecithin. Many people use herbs only for treating the symptoms of a disease in the absence of adequate nutrition and without considering the whole being. For instance, if we use an herbal ear oil externally to treat a chronic ear infec- tion without addressing why the body is unable to fight the infection by itself, we are not using a holistic approach toward healing. Instead, we are treat- ing only the symptoms of a disorder that emanates from the body’s inabili- ty to defend itself. While the ear oil may inhibit the external microbial cause of the infection, it is really doing nothing more than serving as a natural alternative to any number of pharma- ceutical preparations that may be able to alleviate symptoms more quickly. However, if our goals are to reach beyond the symptoms to affect the underlying causes of disease, the heal- ing effort must begin by ensuring that the body is afforded everything it needs to heal itself. In other words, we must provide the body with the foundation of holistic health—com- plete nutrition—before our healing efforts with herbal medicines can begin to approach curative results. Using Nutritive Herbs as Dietary Supplements Many herbs are foods, and some pro- vide nutritional qualities in such abun- dance that they can be used as nutri- tional medicines or dietary supplements. Herbs provide minerals, vitamins, fatty acids, and other nutritional components in a form that a body can fully utilize without becoming burdened with excess. Dandelion leaves, for instance, contain impressive amounts of potassi- um and iron but not so much as to pres- ent a risk of toxicity. With nutritive herbs, the body is given the chance to take the nutrients it needs and easily eliminate what it does not, unlike many highly concentrated vitamin supple- ments that force the liver, kidneys, and digestive tract to work overtime at their jobs of eliminating the excess. On the other hand, the nutritional content of herbs may vary considerably from plant to plant, and in therapeutic or dietary situations where high concentrations of specific vitamins or minerals must be guaranteed, herbs usually prove to be inadequate. Many herbs can be used as nutri- tional adjuncts to a good diet. Finding which nutritive herbs are best for the needs of an individual animal comes from the one-on-one experience of the caregiver with his or her animal, but a simple dried herb formula that can be used for most dogs, cats, horses, fer- rets, and other animals can be found in the box on page 38. The Ethical Use of Herbs We are living in a time when millions of people are turning away from any- thing they perceive as artificial, unhealthy, or forced upon them. A huge natural health care industry has arisen, fueled by people who are eager to embrace products, healing meth- ods, and lifestyles that offer a healing step back toward nature. On the sur- face of this “green revolution,” more people are becoming aware of the cur- ative possibilities that exist beneath the trees, and a renewed sense of hope for a healthy environment has been born. But in many ways, this scenario also brings about a whole new level of environmental crisis. While a great deal of promise may exist in our grow- ing awareness of earth’s natural treas- ures, our journey toward “getting back to basics” is consuming resources faster than we can learn to replace Principles and Practices of Herbalism 39 Herbs for Pets 40 BASIC ETHICAL GUIDELINES FOR THE HARVESTING OF WILD PLANTS Follow these ethical guidelines if you wish to have the least impact on our earth while harvesting medicinal plants from wild areas. • Never gather endangered or environmentally sensitive species. Many plants are abundant in certain areas but relatively rare in others. Learn to recognize and use plant species in your home bioregion that are abundant and resilient to human impact, while taking into account that the ecological niche you see is a small, unique part of a much larger environmental picture. Get to know the general sta- tus of the plants you are interested in from a global perspective. You may find that as an “ecoherbalist,” your role among certain plants around your home is strictly that of guardian. • Be absolutely certain of plant identification before you harvest. Gathering the wrong plants not only may be harmful to you and your pets but may be wasteful and potentially damaging to the ecosystem as well. • Collect a small amount of plant material from several different stands to minimize your impact. Never gather so much from a stand of plants that you can see a dif- ference after your harvest. Remember, mathematical solutions to the number of plants that can be ethically harvested do not apply in the natural realm. The only way to determine how much is ethically acceptable is to begin learning about the ecology of your bioregion before you harvest. Observe your impact over a long period of time, and always gather conservatively. • Never gather from a group of plants until you have thoroughly investigated the health, welfare, sustainability, and interdependent elements of the entire area. Is there a healthier stand nearby? Is the stand large enough to sustain your impact? Do you know the ecosystem well enough to harvest plants in a manner that is conducive to its health? What may seem to be a lush, healthy stand of plants may in fact be a biocommunity in trouble. Walk, look, listen, feel, and, most important, learn as much as you can about the ways of the land before you begin your harvest. • Never gather more than you can conservatively use, bearing in mind that many herbs lose their potency quickly after harvest. Unless you plan to make alcohol tinctures, expect no more than six months to a year of shelf life for properly dried and stored herbs. • Always ask permission before entering private lands, even if you are doing the landowner a favor by pulling a few weeds. Check with your local land manage- ment agencies for permit requirements before you begin gathering herbs from public lands. Principles and Practices of Herbalism 41 • Keep a journal of your observations during each visit to a harvest site and learn to work within nature’s capacity. Remember, you will always be a student in nature, and there are no absolutes in how an ecosystem operates. Maintain a set of wildcrafting site records, and keep a detailed log for each wildcrafting ven- ture. From these records, you can monitor your long-term impacts while enrich- ing your awareness of nature. • Gather only from areas that are endemic to the plants you are looking for. Learn the typical elevation, habitat, soil composition, exposure, and climatic require- ments of each plant you wish to harvest, then harvest from areas that match these criteria. Small, isolated stands of plants that have adapted to an unusual set of environmental circumstances are particularly vulnerable to human impact and should be used for learning, not for medicine making. • Learn the environmental issues of your area, and familiarize yourself with other people who have an interest in the wild lands you will be working within, includ- ing other herbalists, the logging and mining communities, developers, environ- mentalist groups, and government agencies. Learn about their plans for the land, and adjust your activities. Plan ahead for the possibility of future impact. • Find opportunities to salvage or transplant useful plants from areas that are sched- uled to be heavily impacted by human activities such as areas where trail or road construction is planned. Many areas have ongoing native plant restoration projects under way. In these instances, you might be able to assist with the survival of native species by “weeding out” the invasive, nonnative species. • Find ideal stands that are representative of how a plant community should look, then don’t harvest from them. Instead, preserve them for use as models from which to base your observations and stewardship efforts at the sites from which you will be harvesting. • Always use the correct tools and wear the right clothing to get your job done. Digging long taproots from a steep, rocky hillside with a soupspoon while wear- ing penny loafers will result not only in physical trauma to the herbalist but will tear apart the hillside as well. Be considerate of the environment by acknowledg- ing that the human body is poorly adapted to many of the tasks we perform there. • Never gather from stands that are wilted or otherwise unhealthy. Not only may sick plants have altered chemistries but they may be covered with poison as well. Contact your county, state, or federal weed abatement officials and learn about weed control programs in your area before you harvest anything. Check your local noxious weed list, and see if there is an opportunity to reduce the distribution of toxic herbicides by offering to hand-pull the plants for healing purposes. Many homeowners and farmers will welcome you onto their land to gather plants such as dandelion, Saint- John’s-wort, mullein, burdock, or countless others. By focusing your wildcrafting efforts toward plants that people generally hate, you will be giving a precious gift of healing back to the environment by reducing the use of toxic herbicides. Herbs for Pets 42 • Be as quiet as possible and plan every step when you enter a wild area. Stop fre- quently to look, listen, and feel the earth; and don’t forget to look behind you to monitor the impact you may be causing while en route to that special patch. • When gathering from a stand of plants, work at a deliberate pace that allows you to remain conscious of your surroundings and of the task at hand. Harvest carefully and thoughtfully. Don’t attack the plants; work as the loving caretaker you are. • Always be careful to use the proper processing and storage methods for the herbs you gather. Spoilage equates to waste—one of the worst types of vicarious human impact. Good wildcrafting ethics are not exclusive to your time in the field—take care of the plants all the way from earth to medicine. • Stay obscure during your harvest and field studies. If you attract uninvited attention to a stand of plants, the result might be added impact from curious onlookers. A good rule is to always focus your efforts in areas where you will remain out of the view of other people. • Be critical of your human shortcomings. We are foreigners in wild areas. Strive to deepen your awareness to understand that even the simplest organisms of nature serve complex roles in the environment, and that we are all just beginning to learn the ways of the wild. Nothing is insignificant, and virtually every organism in an ecosystem is interdependent with the plants we harvest. • Never reseed a stand of plants to an extent that exceeds the natural density that existed prior to your harvest. A human-engineered overpopulation of plants can be as devastating to an ecosystem as careless overharvesting. Watch the bioregion from which you are harvesting over a period of several years, and take note of how each species reseeds itself. Then try to replicate what nature would do in your absence. Many plants compete with one another. Propagating an overabundance of a species may be satisfactory to our conscience but may also pass a death sentence to dozens of noncompeting plants and interdependent organisms. • Accept your personal weaknesses, identify your chronic mistakes, then add to this list your own personal set of wildcrafting guidelines. To learn more about the earth-conscious harvest, use, and preservation of wild medicinal plants, pick up a copy of From Earth to Herbalist by Gregory L. Tilford (Mountain Press Publishing, 1998). them. It seems that a great many of us have become so intoxicated by the freedom-based premise of using self- prescribed natural alternatives, we have forgotten where they come from. Many plant species are disappear- ing not so much because they are overharvested but because they are misrepresented in the marketplace. Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), for example, has been one of the most popular North American herbs of com- merce for centuries, but it is also one of the most misused. Like many other herbs, goldenseal continues to be her- alded as some sort of miracle medicine that is effective against virtually any microbe that terrifies us enough to try something “alternative.” Indeed, the popularity of this and many other herbs has arisen from therapeutic suc- cess stories and promising scientific studies, but most of their appeal is attributable to marketing savvy and no small measure of consumer hyste- ria. In truth, most plant medicines work within narrow parameters of therapeutic usefulness. Goldenseal is not a systemic antibiotic that courses through the body to fight infection like a shot of penicillin; instead, it works only to inhibit microbes it comes in direct contact with on the surface membranes of the digestive tract, eyes, and nasal passages. We must also take into account that many medicinal plants are at risk of disappearing because of factors totally unrelated to their uses as medicines. Pipsissewa (Chimaphila spp.), for instance, is used as a “secret ingredi- ent” in certain brands of soft drinks, and the habitat destruction associated with its harvest may be more devastat- ing than the loss of the plants them- selves. Another example is goldthread (Coptis spp.), which is an old-growth forest inhabitant that is quickly run- ning out of places to live in the Pacific Northwest. Goldthread is not a popu- lar plant of commerce in North America, but the old-growth firs and cedars it lives beneath are. And then there’s all the hype. Newsstands are packed with the latest word about scientific herbal break- throughs, even about the same medi- cines that just yesterday were consid- ered “snake oil” in the eyes of science. Some herbs are becoming as fashion- able as the fastest computer: if you haven’t tried the latest herbal craze, then your life is unnecessarily difficult. Don’t take Prozac—we’ve got Saint- John’s-wort, the herbal alternative for chronic depression. Too busy to slow down? Don’t worry. The latest double- blind studies say that we can boost the body’s immune system with echinacea, cat’s claw, astragalus, and ginseng. Herbs are touching the far reaches of our society at an unprece- dented rate. Much of what drives this green revolution is born from solid scientific discovery and consumers’ inde- pendent desire to take charge of their health and well-being. Certainly, these are good goals, but where do herbs come from? Is there something we should know about their natural environment? What do these plants contribute to their ecosystems? Do they really work the way that we are led to believe? What makes herbs different from Principles and Practices of Herbalism 43 conventional medicines? What effect is our consumption having upon plant populations and their environments? Our point is this: We have to be care- ful. If we wish to use and sustain our botanical resources into the future, we must step away from all the hoopla long enough to find healthful solutions for the plants themselves. The answers to all of the above questions rest within our will- ingness to look beyond the sensational advertising to see what herbs really are and what they represent in the larger global scheme of things. Until we do, our herbal heritage will continue to dis- appear under the pressures of ignorance, waste, and greed. Many North American medicinal plants of commerce are now being cul- tivated, but sadly, many of them contin- ue to disappear from the wild. While part of the problem stems from unethi- cal wildcrafting practices, the demise for plants such as goldenseal and American ginseng originates from a complexity of economic and environmental causes. As herbalists, we could easily point an accusatory finger at the herb industry, but this would not be fair. Many herbal- ists have chosen to exclude wild plants such as goldenseal, American ginseng, black cohosh, and osha from their per- sonal medicine cabinets as a gesture, if not a preventive measure against their demise. But in sad reality, such measures provide only a bandage treatment for a global problem. The painful truth is that too many people are impacting too much of the planet for too many rea- sons. Indeed, consumer demands are taking a serious toll on plants such as goldenseal and American ginseng, but these and thousands of other plant species are also disappearing under the combined pressures of logging, grazing, mining, weed abatement, urban devel- opment, farming, pollution, recreational impact, and several other human-cen- tered factors. So then, what can we do to save medicinal plants? On a community level, we can share what we learn from books such as this one by educating others on the curative possibilities that may exist beneath the trees around their homes. Show your neighbor a medicinal plant that grows on the roadside—such as mullein, dandelion, licorice, Saint-John’s- wort, or milkweed—and raise the ques- tion of whether a weed is really just a weed. Tell people about the plight of goldenseal, and remind them that the greatest curative gifts of this plant may yet to be discovered. Then tell them they can use Oregon grape as a substitute. On a personal level, you can accom- plish even more. Join organizations such as United Plant Savers, become involved with native plant clubs in your area, or become actively involved in land restora- tion efforts. If you use herbs, learn as much as you can about the plants and the ecosystems they live in. Above all, take time to evaluate and improve yourself as a consumer of our planet’s resources, and learn how to give something back for everything you consume. Herbs for Pets 44 Principles and Practices of Herbalism 45 AN A-Z GUIDE TO HERBS FOR ANIMALS T hese detailed monographs are specific to the identification, harvest, prepa- ration, and applications of the herbs we most frequently find useful in the care of animals. Please keep in mind that this is not an exhaustive list of the herb resources that are available to you and your pet; it represents only a few that are most familiar to us and other herbalists who find themselves involved in the care of animals. To list and describe the hundreds of other potentially useful herbs that exist worldwide would be time and space prohibitive, if not impossible. Despite all measures of scientific study or clinical success that may be in place to validate and substantiate the efficacy and safety of an herb (or for that matter any medicine), it is important to remember that a golden rule must never be for- gotten: There are no absolutes in nature. Each individual animal is unique so no single herb can be relied upon to work at the same level of effectiveness in each and every animal. With this rule in mind, we have also included a supplemental herb list at the end of this chapter where you will find general information about several other herbs you may find useful in the care of your companion. The herbs in this list should not be overlooked as lesser or secondary options but as resources worthy of further investigation. Following is an explanation of the subheads: Appearance: Under this subheading is a brief physical description of the sub- ject plant. Please keep in mind that the plant descriptions we provide here are intended only to give you a general idea of what a specific plant looks like. This book is not intended to serve as a definitive means of plant identification. The process of accurately identifying a plant involves the use of a highly scientific botanical plant key that enables the user to systematically recognize or rule out char- acteristics that are unique to a species. To obtain a botanical key that is specific to Materia Medica Materia Medica Chapter 2 Herbs for Pets 48 plants in your area, visit your local library or obtain one from a bookstore. To learn how to use a botanical key, consider tak- ing an introductory botany class at your local college. Habitat and Range: Under this sub- heading we tell you where you can expect to find the subject plant growing in the wild. We may also mention which climatic regions are best suited to the cultivation of the plant. Cycle and Bloom Season: Here we inform you of the reproductive charac- teristics of the plant. Parts Used: Under this subheading we have listed the plant parts (leaves, root, etc.) that are most commonly used by herbalists. Primary Medicinal Activities: This is not an exhaustive list—most herbs offer dozens of medicinal activities, many of which may be too weak to be of thera- peutic value. Here we have listed the strongest and most predictable effects the herb is likely to produce when used in a healing context with most animals. Strongest Affinities: Under this sub- heading we have listed the body struc- tures or systems that are likely to benefit the most from the medicinal activities of the herb. Preparation: Here we have listed which types of medicinal preparation (infusion, alcohol tincture, glycerin tinc- ture, decoction, etc.) are best suited to the use of the herb. Common Uses: Under this subheading you will find the “meat” of the mono- graph. Here we identify and explain what we feel are the best applications for the herb. This information is a mix of personal opinion, hands-on experience, clinical observations, and scientific and anecdotal evidence. We’ve included information about scientific studies that we feel are espe- cially relevant to the use of herbs in ani- mals. We vehemently oppose any form of experimentation that imposes dis- comfort, disease, or a reduced quality of life upon an animal. Such experi- mentation violates the foundations of holistic healing—wellness cannot be Materia Medica 49 sustained from induced suffering. However, we also feel responsible to the animals who have already suffered or died at the hands of human science. We must do our best to assure that the knowledge we have gained from their past suffering is not wasted, and that every shred of useful knowledge that humanity has gained through their sac- rifices is used for other animals in the form of better care and better under- standing. In the realm of holistic heal- ing, there is no need or justification for future animal experimentation—but there is also no point in denying our- selves or our pets the understanding we have already attained, even if by dark, arrogant means. Availability: Here you will find infor- mation specific to where you can access the herb. Propagation and Harvest: Under this subheading is information about how to grow your own plants or how to harvest and handle the herb in the wild. If har- vesting wild plants interests you, please keep these three important rules in mind before embarking on any wildcrafting ventures: 1) Do not pick any plants that are endangered or scarce. 2) Beware of pesticides. Never gather plants from road- sides, cultivated fields, irrigation ditches, or other areas where weed control efforts may have taken place. 3) You must be 100 percent certain of the identity of the plant you are picking— before you pick it! Alternatives and Adjuncts: Under this subheading we list and categorize herbs that serve especially well as alter- natives or as complementary additions to the herb we have been discussing throughout the monograph. Cautions and Comments: Here you will find any contraindications or side effects that we are aware of. You will also find our comments and opinions relative to the overall safety or potential misuses of the herb. References: Most of the scientific studies used to research each monograph can be accessed through the Internet at the Medline Web site: www.medline.gov. Herbs for Pets 50 ALFALFA Medicago sativa Pea Family Appearance: Alfalfa is a sprawling mem- ber of the pea family (Leguminosae) with small, tightly arranged blue or sometimes pink or white flowers; small, prickly, seed- bearing pods; and cloverlike leaves. Habitat and Range: Widely cultivated throughout the world Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that first blooms in early summer, alfalfa continues to bloom after successive har- vests throughout the growing season as long as the climate permits vigorous regrowth. Parts Used: Dried leaves, stems, unopened flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Nu- tritive, anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, stimulates urination (diuretic) Strongest Affinities: Musculoskeletal system, digestive tract, liver Preparation: Capsules, infusion, liquid extract, or dried bulk herb sprinkled onto food Common Uses: Alfalfa contains a broad spectrum of nutrients, including consid- erable quantities of protein (up to 50 percent by weight), trace minerals, dietary fiber, and vitamins A, B1, B12, C, D, E, and K. It is also high in chlorophyll, which serves as an antioxidant in the bloodstream. All of this makes alfalfa par- ticularly attractive as a livestock feed. In addition to being highly nutritive, alfalfa is traditionally known as one of the best herbal treatments for arthritis, rheuma- tism, and gout. Clinical research of the use of alfalfa in treating these diseases has shown that at least 10 to 20 percent of human subjects experience dramatic reduction of painful symptoms. Tra- ditional uses in animals have commonly led to similar results. For arthritis and other inflammatory diseases of the joints, alfalfa can bring long-term relief to dogs, cats, rodents, and horses and various other herbivores who receive it as a daily food supplement. By now you probably see the value of this herb in the care of older animals. For use in therapeutic doses, it works well when combined with dandelion, yucca, and licorice. Alfalfa possesses cancer-preventive qualities as well. It is believed that alfalfa induces complex cellular activities that serve to inactivate chemical carcinogens in the liver and small intestine before they can cause damage, thus helping to reduce the risk of cancerous growths. Medicago sativa a Materia Medica 51 a Alfalfa’s considerable vitamin K con- tent has been shown to be beneficial in remedying bleeding disorders that may result from long-term use of antibiotics, anticoagulants, aspirin, and anticonvul- sant drugs. The coumarin constituent of alfalfa is also well known for its antico- agulant qualities, and in fact many anti- clotting drugs were derived from this compound. Excessive doses of fresh alfalfa or concentrated extracts may be contraindicated in animals with anemia, but moderate dietary supplementation may be useful in some types of this disease. The various saponin constituents of alfalfa are known to help with the absorption of fat-soluble nutrients in the small intestine and may act to stimulate the body’s natural production of growth hormones—yet another reason for its popularity as a livestock feed. In this capacity, alfalfa works by mechanisms very similar to those of yucca, but it is much less irritating to the stomach and intestines than yucca and therefore can be used over longer periods without adverse side effects. It may be especially useful in animals with debilitating dis- eases who need to gain weight but can- not afford added stress upon compro- mised body systems. In the urinary tract, alfalfa has an alka- linizing effect, making it useful in treat- ing ailments that involve overly acidic urine, especially where there is bladder irritation and crystal formation. This nutritional plant also helps an animal adjust to a new diet. For the brain, alfalfa is said to help improve mental vigor. This is likely due to alfalfa’s broad spectrum of nutrients, many of which are critical to proper nerve and brain functions. Availability: Health food stores; can be propagated in a home garden Propagation and Harvest: Alfalfa is extremely easy to grow just about any- where. In fact, if allowed to spread, it quickly becomes competitive with every- thing else in the garden. Being a legume, alfalfa changes nitrogen into a usable form within its extensive root system, making it a valuable soil-building ingre- dient when the plants are tilled in. Unfortunately, the weedlike character of this plant overshadows its value as a soil builder. Digging the roots is like pulling crabgrass, and tilling often results in even greater proliferation from the subsequent root cuttings. In other words, buy certified organic alfal- fa at an herb store, unless you wish to delegate a portion (or perhaps all) of your garden to it. (A word of caution to the insistent gardener: If you plant alfalfa and then have second thoughts about keeping it, remove it before it goes to seed. Once it does, it’s yours for life!) Gather alfalfa before it comes into bloom. Cut (or mow) the plants during dry weather, cutting the stems at about 1 inch above ground level. Allow the herb to dry in an airy, moisture-free place that is away from direct sunlight until it is completely dry, or make a tincture from the freshly cut greens. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Dan- delion, garlic, licorice, red clover, and yucca Cautions and Comments: Alfalfa is regarded as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Although adverse side effects are rare, many horse owners testify that consumption of too much fresh alfalfa may lead to colic, a condition that can be serious in animals. This is due in large part to alfalfa’s saponin constituents. Although these soaplike compounds are medicinally Herbs for Pets 52 valuable, used in excess they may irritate the stomach lining and intestinal mucosa, resulting in nausea and gastri- tis. Horses and rabbits cannot vomit, which greatly compounds the serious- ness of this side effect. The risk of colic occurring is greatly reduced by feeding only dried greens. The seeds of alfalfa have been found to contain a toxic amino acid, l-canava- nine, which has caused blood disorders in humans and in animals. Use alfalfa only during its prebloom stages of growth. Alfalfa can trigger allergic responses in animals who are especially sensitive to pollens. ALOE Aloe spp. Lily Family Appearance: Aloes are cactuslike members of the lily family (Liliaceae), having narrow, tapering, proportion- ately thick, succulent leaves with spiny margins. There are perhaps five hun- dred species of aloe, but the most com- mon aloe of commerce is Aloe bar- badensis, which we commonly know as aloe vera. This species produces its leaves directly from a stout central stalk, in a rosette fashion, while several other varieties of aloe are branched, almost bushlike. Aside from these vari- ations, all aloes share a similar appear- ance and can grow very large. In some areas of southwestern Africa, aloes are seen in excess of 25 feet tall with stems more than 10 feet in circumference. Flowers are small, tubular, characteristi- cally lilylike in appearance, and are pro- duced in leafless, terminal spikes. Habitat and Range: Aloes are indige- nous to southern and eastern Africa and have been introduced to the West Indies, where a great deal of commercial culti- vation takes place. In areas of North America and Europe with Mediterranean climates, aloes are used as landscape and garden plants. They are popular indoor plants throughout much of the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: Aloes are perennials that bloom opportunistically when mature. In other words, if they receive all of the elements they require to thrive, they will likely remain in bloom throughout each year of their lives. Parts Used: Primarily the gel-like juice of the inner leaf or the yellowish latex contained immediately beneath the skin of the leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Wound healing (vulnerary), soothes skin (emol- lient), anti-bacterial, antioxidant, stimu- lates the immune system (immunostimu- lant), anticancer, antitumor, cooling to the skin. Strongest Affinities: Skin, digestive system, lymph system Preparation: Freshly pressed juice or stabilized (commercial) aloe gel prepara- tions are the most commonly used forms of aloe. Using this plant at home is as easy as cutting a mature leaf from the lower part of the plant and squeezing out the juice. Intravenous formulations of aloe ingredients have been FDA- approved and are available for use by veterinarians. Acemannan, a chemical compound found in aloe vera juice, is a powerful immunostimulant. Common Uses: Aloe’s great claim to fame is from its use as a topical skin dressing. Fresh aloe juice or commer- cially prepared gel contains dozens of minerals, proteins, enzymes, polysac- charides, and other elements that help a Materia Medica 53 a soften and soothe the skin and pro- mote the rapid healing of minor burns and wounds. Topical application of aloe gel will likely bring immediate, cooling relief to fleabites, poison ivy, and sunburns. It is also excellent for reducing the itch and tightening of postsurgical incisions. Applied after sutures are removed, the gel reduces much of the irritation that so often leads to persistent chewing or scratch- ing and may result in inflammation and infection. In any external application, apply enough juice to lightly cover the affected area and allow it to dry. If pos- sible, keep the animal from licking it off—the idea is to leave the juice on as long as possible. Unless your animal has an adverse reaction to the juice (such as reddening or an allergy rash), aloe can be applied liberally once or twice per day until the healing process is progressing well. Internally, a small dose of aloe juice may be useful for healing minor injuries and irritations of the digestive tract, such as those that may occur when Bowser swallows a jagged bone. Scientists have recently found that acemannan acts as a strong immunos- timulant in animals, particularly in cats. It has been found to be especially effec- tive in the treatment of fibrosarcoma and feline leukemia virus (FeLV). It is theorized that acemannan triggers an increase in the autoimmune attack upon the viruses believed to cause these usually fatal diseases. Typically, over 70 percent of cats who become ill with FeLV die within ten weeks of the onset of disease. But in a recent study, forty-four cats with confirmed FeLV were injected with 2 milligrams per kilogram of acemannan weekly for six weeks and reexamined six weeks after the treatment ended. At the end of the twelve-week study, 71 percent of the cats were alive and in good health. Acemannan has also been shown to be effective against cancerous tumors in rodents and dogs. It has been FDA approved for veterinary use and will undoubtedly be tested in humans. Other chemical compounds found in aloe juice have been shown to have antioxidant actions in the body. Availability: Aloe gel or juice (the dif- ference being consistency) is available at health food stores. Any good nursery has the plants. Propagation and Harvest: Aloe is easy to grow as a houseplant. It requires well-drained, sandy soil and should be watered only once or twice a month. Avoid using potting soil—it retains too much moisture and may cause rot prob- lems. Ordinary garden soil will do fine. A happy aloe that receives plenty of Aloe barbadensis Herbs for Pets 54 sunlight will bloom continuously and reproduce aggressively from side-shoots. These shoots are easily transplanted into separate pots. If you live in an area where frost is rare, aloe can be planted in a gar- den. Again, just give it plenty of sun, don’t overwater it, and it will be yours forever. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Nothing really compares with aloe, but if you don’t have it around, look toward chick- weed, plantain, self-heal, and comfrey as topical alternatives. Internally, ginger, cayenne, red clover, cleavers, dandelion, yarrow, garlic, and burdock are worth considering to complement the activity of aloe. Cautions and Comments: Aloe juice, although bitter, is generally safe for inter- nal or external uses in dogs, cats and most other animal types. However, be cautious of any products containing “Aloes.” Aloes consists of a sticky latex that is extracted from the inner skin of aloe leaves. This latex possesses strong purgative qualities that may result in digestive distress and severe diarrhea. Although several commercial laxative preparations use aloe latex in their for- mulas, we strongly discourage their use in animals. It is believed that aloe com- ponents may be passed in mother’s milk to nursing infants, so it should not be used in such circumstances. ARNICA Arnica spp. Sunflower Family Appearance: Arnica is a classic sun- flower with bright yellow daisylike flow- ers. Leaves oppose one another on the stem and range from narrowly lance shaped to broadly heart shaped (depending on species). The leaves and stems of most species are at least partial- ly covered with fine hairs. Most arnicas are aromatic, particularly when the leaves are bruised, with a distinctive pinelike odor. Arnicas are small plants, seldom exceeding 12 inches in height. Habitat and Range: Arnica is a moun- tain plant that occurs in coniferous sub- alpine and alpine regions of western North America from Alaska to the moun- tains of southern California, where it grows only above 9,000 feet in elevation. Cycle and Bloom Season: Arnica is a perennial that blooms during its second year of growth and every year thereafter. It is among the first flowers to bloom in early spring and is often one of the first to die back in early summer. During dry years, arnica may not bloom at all. Parts Used: The entire flowering plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Heals wounds, dilates blood vessels Strongest Affinities: Muscles and subdermal capillaries Preparation: Oil infusion, water infu- sion, fresh poultice, or commercially pre- pared gel Common Uses: Arnica is used for closed-tissue injuries, including fractures, sprains, and contusions. It is perhaps the best-known herbal sports medicine. Used topically, preparations of arnica act to open up peripheral capillaries and lymph ducts and increase circulation in tissues that are engorged with fluids as a result of injury. When used immediately after an injury occurs, results can be dra- matic. In essence, arnica helps to speed the healing process by moving waste- bound fluids out and moving cleansing a Materia Medica 55 a fluids and platelets into the affected area. Arnica is especially valuable for treat- ment of horses and other large animals who are subjected to rigorous exercise and an occasional twist or strain of the leg or hip joints. Arnica can be used on dogs as well, but special measures must be taken to prohibit the animal from lick- ing it off because arnica can be toxic if taken internally in improper dosages. Cats are not excluded from the use of arnica, but they are more sensitive to arnica’s volatile oils and are more prone to allergic reactions with this herb as they are with so many other substances. Test a small portion of your cat’s skin before using arnica for an injury. Look for development of redness or other signs of irritation. To use arnica on a dog or cat, apply enough of the infusion or gel to wet the skin of the animal (not just the fur), then wrap the area with gauze or a piece of cloth and secure it so the animal cannot easily remove it. The idea is to keep the preparation on the animal as long as possible. Arnica can be applied this way twice daily for up to three days. Long- term applications should not be neces- sary and are not recommended because a rash is likely to develop from overuse. When used internally in carefully measured doses, arnica is said to act as a neurological device in cases of chronic urinary incontinence that cannot be attributed to physiological pathologies. While use of arnica in this capacity holds a great deal of promise for many animals suffering from urinary incontinence, the toxicity of this plant limits such use to the advanced professional. Talk with a holistic veterinarian if you are interested in this use. Although this book focuses on herbal remedies, the value of arnica in homeo- pathic preparations should not be over- looked. In a homeopathic capacity, arni- ca can be used internally with a great margin of safety. We have seen amazing results with the use of homeopathic arni- ca at the onset of traumatic injury in ani- mals, and keeping homeopathic arnica on hand is as simple as purchasing a small vial of the tiny white pellets and slipping it into your pocket, purse, or first aid kit. To learn more about using home- opathic arnica, we highly recommend Dr. Pitcairn’s Complete Guide to Natural Health for Dogs & Cats. Availability: Arnica gels and tinctures are readily available from herb retailers. Seeds are available from specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Arnica requires soil with plenty of organic mat- ter and does best when its root system can crawl around under a blanket of pine needles. Given that it is seldom found at Arnica cordifolia Herbs for Pets 56 altitudes under 3,000 feet except in Canada, it likely has some specialized light- or air-quality requirements that prohibit it from flourishing in urban areas. If you live in the mountains, arnica can be grown from seeds or root cut- tings. But beware—the roots will quickly consume your garden. To harvest arnica from the wild, grasp the stem of the flowering herb just above ground level, then snap it off, taking only what you need. Take care not to damage the roots by pulling on the plant or step- ping into a patch of plants—the roots crawl horizontally, and the pressure of a human foot can injure them. After gathering what you need, you have the option of processing them fresh or allowing them to dry in a dark place. Fresh plants yield a more potent infusion but spoil quickly in the refriger- ator because of their water content. Regardless, we opt for the use of fresh arnica. To learn how to make an oil infu- sion, refer to chapter 1. Another option for the use of arnica in emergency situations is to make a sim- ple poultice by mashing a flowering plant with some water to make a pesto- like paste. The poultice can then be applied to the injury as a crude oint- ment. It can really work wonders when you’re out on the trail—just bear in mind that animals (or people) should not ingest the poultice in any quantity. Alternative and Adjunct Herbs: Saint-John’s-wort, ginger, cayenne, and yarrow are good choices as internal adjunct therapies here. Saint-John’s-wort can be used topically as well and is espe- cially useful if nerve trauma is suspected. Cautions and Comments: Arnica can be toxic if ingested in anything but homeopathic or minute quantities and may cause internal bleeding if ingested in large enough quantities. Because arni- ca works quickly to stimulate dilation and circulation of peripheral blood ves- sels, it should not be applied to open, bleeding wounds. To do so might actual- ly increase bleeding and slow the coagu- lation process. Animals generally dislike the taste, but extra measures are war- ranted to prohibit dogs and cats from licking arnica-treated areas. ASTRAGALUS Astragalus membranaceous Pea Family Appearance: A typical member of the pea family, astragalus has finely divided leaves, small pealike flowers and seed pods, and a sprawling, vinelike stature that brings to mind any of the hundreds of wild vetches that inhabit much of the globe. Astragalus membranaceous, the species of commerce, may grow as tall as 6 feet, which gives it an appearance that is similar to licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.), yet another member of the pea family. There is a growing belief among herbalists, botanists, and medical researchers that North American milk vetch (A. americana), a common weed, may have similar medic- inal attributes and may even be the same plant as A. membranaceous, the medicinal astragalus of commerce. The Astragalus genus is large, consisting of hundreds of species, which in many cases are difficult to differentiate even by trained botanists. Some varieties of Astragalus are toxic, and to compound this mystery even more, these plants often cross-pollinate and hybridize. For now, no one knows whether or not we have a wild, medicinal Astragalus in North America. Habitat and Range: An import from China, Astragalus has been cultivated throughout much of the world as an important herb of commerce. a Materia Medica 57 a Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from spring to early summer Parts Used: Mature (at least three years old) roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Immuno-stimulant, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, mildly depresses thyroid func- tion (hypothyroid), lowers blood pres- sure (hypotensive), aids blood cleansing (alterative), strengthens digestion Strongest Affinities: Immune system, lungs, liver, heart, kidneys, thyroid, digestive tract Preparation: Tincture or infusion Common Uses: One of the best known and widely used herbs in Chinese medi- cine (where the herb is known as huang qi), astragalus has found its way into Western herbalism by virtue of its widely versatile immune-strengthening qualities. In Chinese medicine, astragalus root is considered sweet and mildly warm, tonify- ing the qi (pronounced “chee”) and hoist- ing the yang. (Sweet and warm are terms used in Chinese medicine to describe an herb’s relation to the body’s energy flows and do not relate to flavor.) Astragalus root is commonly used for spleen and lung qi deficiency, including symptoms of emacia- tion, weariness, shortness of breath, loss of appetite, diarrhea, and prolapse of the uterus or anus. Astragalus is especially useful for strengthening the body against viral infections of the respiratory tract and heart through stimulation of killer-cell activity and interferon production in the body. It imparts direct antibacterial and anti-inflammatory qualities to this effort as well. Astragalus is a viable option for early treatment of various forms of respiratory infection, including kennel cough (Borde- tella bronchiseptica), a condition that the- oretically involves this bacterium’s oppor- tunistic cooperation with various forms of virus. While astragalus works to stimulate T cell activity and helps to raise white blood cell counts, it also boosts the body’s defenses through its liver-strengthening attributes. In a study involving rats, saponin constituents were shown to enhance DNA synthesis in the liver—a process believed to be a major factor in the strengthening of cell structures against infection or the introduction of toxins. Other studies suggest that astra- galus may be useful for helping the body protect itself and speed recovery from the damaging effects of long-term steroid therapies. Astragalus is known to strengthen kidney circulation, making it useful in early stages of kidney infection or renal failure. For any of the aforementioned purpos- es, up to 20 drops of the extract can be Astragalus membranaceous Herbs for Pets 58 administered for each 20 pounds of your animal’s body weight, up to twice daily. In addition to its broad-spectrum abili- ty to boost resistance to disease, astragalus is traditionally used to boost energy levels in debilitated people and animals, which adds to its promise as a candidate in the treatment of various cancers, especially those compounded by depressed immune functions. For pet owners who are going through the horrors of chemotherapy or radiation treatments for their animals, astragalus may offer a foothold in main- taining some functional balance in an immune system that is stressed by both a disease and toxic intervention. To use astragalus in this capacity, first consult a holistic veterinarian. Astragalus is also known to have antivi- ral qualities that are specific to infections of the heart. Again, if you suspect a problem of this serious nature, talk to a holistic vet- erinarian. Availability: Astragalus is available through many herb retailers. The seed can be purchased from specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Astragalus is easy to grow from seed—some rich soil, full sun, and ample watering are all it requires to thrive. If you decide to grow this plant in your garden, however, choose a place where it can remain for quite some time. Astragalus roots require three or more years to reach their full medicinal potential, and during this time, the plants will likely spread throughout the area where they were planted. Do not plant astragalus unless you are certain that the seed you have is in fact A. membrana- ceous, and do not plant astragalus if you live in an area where soils have a high sele- nium (a nonmetallic element) content. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For respira- tory infections, astragalus combines well with coltsfoot, grindelia, or mullein leaf. For kidney infections or dysfunction, couch grass, corn silk, pipsissewa, and goldenrod are noteworthy adjuncts. For use in situations involving liver toxicity, cancer, or depressed immune functions, gentle tonic herbs with diuretic, alterative, and nutritive qualities are indicated to help remove toxins and excess waste from the body. Dandelion, burdock, red clover, licorice, and alfalfa are excellent herbs to investigate. For an overactive thyroid, Astragalus works well by itself, but if you don’t have access to any, an alternative choice might be bugleweed. Cautions and Comments: While A. membranaceous, the medicinal variety of Astragalus, is among the safest of medici- nal herbs for both humans and animals, many other species of Astragalus are toxic, especially to grazing animals. Buy astra- galus roots, preparations, and seeds only from reputable sources. Also, astragalus is known to accumulate selenium in its tissues in areas where a high selenium content is present in the soil. Selenium can be toxic in high doses. Check with your county extension agent before planting this herb. In Chinese medicine, astragalus is con- traindicated in “excess heat” and “yin deficiency” patterns. BEE BALM Monarda spp. Mint Family Appearance: This pungent genus of dry land mints is known by many common names: wild bergamot, purple bee balm, horsemint, wild oregano, Oswego tea, and sweet leaf. Leaves are lance shaped, oppose one another on the stem, and have a tendency to curve backward toward the ground. Leaf margins are B Materia Medica 59 b sometimes, but not always, toothed. Like most members of the mint family, the stems of bee balm are distinctively square (four-sided). Flowers are presented in clusters at the top of the plant, each con- taining dozens of tiny, rose- to purple-col- ored blossoms. Perhaps the most distin- guishing characteristic of this plant is its strong but pleasant odor, which ranges from sweetly sagelike to that which leads many to believe they have discovered a wild strain of oregano. The plant can grow to 3 feet on its sturdy stems, but most are found in the range of 6 to 18 inches tall. Habitat and Range: Wild bee balm likes meadows and slopes that are predomi- nantly dry and sunny. Unlike most mints, bee balm is drought tolerant and prefers dry land habitats. Bee balm (M. fistulosa) is generally found at elevations below 4,000 feet. Other varieties of Monarda, such as M. menthaefolia, grow at higher elevations in shady, moist soils. The range of this plant remains largely undefined, but in the U.S. it seems to be spreading westward from the east. Livestock enjoy grazing on this plant and have undoubtedly served as a vehicle in the expansion of bee balm’s range. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms by midsummer and often con- tinues to bloom until the first frost Parts Used: Leaves plucked from the plant; the entire aerial plant if the stem is taken Primary Medicinal Activities: pro- motes sweating (diaphoretic), expels intes- tinal gas (carminative), antiseptic, reduces pain (analgesic), antifungal Strongest Affinities: Skin, mouth, di- gestive tract, kidneys, urinary tract Preparation: Unlike most leafy herbs, which begin to break down and lose their potency after about six months, bee balm can be dried and stored for up to two years. The fresh or dried leaf, stem, and flower material can be made into an alco- hol or glycerin tincture. The dried plant can be infused for use in skin and eyewashes. Common Uses: Although this plant is widely available and infinitely useful, it is often overlooked by herbalists, and it has not received the clinical study that it deserves as a healing ally. Despite an over- all lack of scientific validation, bee balm is a safe herb to use in both animals and humans. Many North American Indian tribes used this plant extensively for heal- ing and in spiritual ceremonies. Like most mints, bee balm has a special affinity toward the digestive tract, where it Monarda fistulosa Herbs for Pets 60 is useful for relieving gastritis and spastic colon. However, it does not taste good, and most herbivores abandon it in favor of less pungent forage. Therefore, for use as a digestive aid in animals, the best form of administering bee balm is gelatin capsules (gel capsules) or a glycerin extract. Bee balm has excellent antibacterial qualities and is especially useful for mouth and gum infections. Two methods of appli- cation work here: a poultice can be made from the dried or fresh herb and applied directly to the affected area, or a strong infusion or tincture can be used the same way. The poultice or infusion can also be effective as an antifungal agent. Dogs, cats, and horses and other large animals with fun- gal infections of the skin are likely to benefit from a generous topical application of bee balm poultice or salve or from twice-daily skin rinses with cooled bee balm tea (also see “Calendula”). To make the tea, cover a generous handful of the herb with hot water and allow it to steep until the water has thoroughly cooled. Don’t worry about straining the herb—just pour the entire mix- ture over the affected areas of the animal. In dry weather, or in cases where the animal chooses to lick the rinse off before it can be effective, you might consider applying the tea as a fomentation (see chapter 1). Bee balm skin rinses also can bring soothing relief to itchy skin that has resulted from infected fleabites or spontaneous dermatitis (commonly caused by poison ivy, nettle stings, or contact allergic reactions) and help to relieve pain while reducing scarring from minor burns. The rinse also imparts a pleasant odor to your pet. In large animals, bee balm tea can be used as a douche or enema to treat fungal or bacterial infections, or to treat irritations of the rectum or vagina. A dilute infusion can be used as a gentle antiseptic and anti-inflammatory eyewash or ear wash, especially if a fungal or bacteri- al infection is suspected. For application in the eye, don’t make the infusion too strong—it should be only light yellow in color. Rinse the eye and surrounding tissues with the use of an irrigation syringe. To add stronger antimicrobial activity to the rinse, a pinch of dried Oregon grape root or certi- fied organic goldenseal can be added to the infusion while it is steeping. Just remember to keep the eye rinse very weak. Ear rinses can be made much stronger. Bee balm works well for low-grade uri- nary tract infections, and you might find it useful for kidney infections as well. Unless you can get your animal to drink the tea, a glycerin-based tincture is probably your best bet: administer 12–25 drops per 20 pounds of animal weight two to three times per day. Availability: Wild harvested or organically grown bee balm is available through herb retailers, as is the tincture. Seeds and plants can be purchased through specialty cata- logs and nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Bee balm reseeds readily and transplants well. This is an excellent plant to introduce into your herb garden. No stratification or other spe- cial treatment is required, and the plant is adaptable to almost any soil. Gather the upper parts of this plant when it is in full bloom (May through September, depend- ing on location), which is when the parts are the most potent. Pluck individual leaves to minimize impact, or gather the stem and leaves after the plant has bloomed and gone to seed. If the latter is your choice, clip the stems about 1 inch above ground level to allow for perennial regrowth and root pro- tection. When gathering while the plant is in bloom, always be sure to leave plenty of flowers intact for pollination and seed development. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Combines well with catnip, chamomile, or fennel for digestive upsets and gas. Works well as an B Materia Medica 61 b infusion with echinacea, couch grass, rasp- berry leaf, or goldenrod for urinary or kidney disorders. As a skin rinse, bee balm serves as a good base infusion to which feverfew flowers can be added for control of fleas. Cautions and Comments: Bee balm is a safe herb, but it often grows in areas that are heavily grazed by livestock, where the pres- ence of neighboring weeds may have led to the introduction of herbicides. Always check or ask for evidence of spraying before you harvest. BLACK WALNUT Juglans nigra Walnut Family Appearance: A large tree that may grow to 120 feet, black walnut is char- acterized by its 6-inch- to 2-foot-long leaves, which are each divided several times into twelve to twenty-four, lance- shaped and toothed leaflets. Fruits are presented as green orbs with fleshy outer husks that later dry into very hard dark-brown nuts. Habitat and Range: Common through- out eastern North America; sporadically distributed throughout the Dakotas, Nebraska, and Kansas; introduced as an ornamental tree in most other regions of the U.S. and southern Canada Cycle and Bloom Season: Blooms in spring; bears fruit beginning in early summer Parts Used: Primarily the green (un- ripe) outer fruit hulls Primary Medicinal Activities: expels worms (anthelmintic), tightens skin and mucous membranes (astrin- gent), may induce vomiting (emetic), laxative Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, skin Preparation: Extract of the green, unripe hulls Common Uses: Our purpose for in- cluding black walnut in this herbal repertory for animals is as much to dis- courage its misuse as it is to express its medicinal attributes. Black walnut hull extract is unquestionably one of the best and safest worming agents offered by the plant world. But like many sub- stances that can actually make a tape- worm hate life, it can be toxic to the host if not used with proper care, cau- tion, and training. Black walnut offers symptomatic worm intervention that is generally safer and kinder to the host animal than most other herbal Juglans nigra Herbs for Pets 62 wormers. The holistically minded pet owner should also take into account that such intervention is actually con- trary to the holistic principles of using herbs in a natural context. Black walnut kills and expels tapeworms, but the underlying reasons an animal is infested with an overpopulation of these oppor- tunity-seeking parasites in the first place is not addressed. For more on the prin- ciples we are referring to, and our rec- ommended approaches to parasite con- trol, please read the section “Parasite- Related Problems” in chapter 3. For now, we must tell you that black wal- nut, although safe and effective when used in the correct dose and where indicated by specific circumstances, is an herb best reserved for use by experi- enced practitioners. Availability: Black walnut is available in the form of an alcohol tincture from several human-oriented herb product companies. Black walnut is also used in several over-the-counter wormers, most of which we do not recommend by virtue of holistic principles. Propagation and Harvest: Black walnut is a beautiful, full-sized shade tree that can be purchased from many landscape nurseries and fruit tree cata- logs. The green, unripe fruit hulls are harvested while they remain fleshy, in early to late spring. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Garlic and raw pumpkin seeds, added to a good natural diet, are the better choic- es for worm control in the majority of circumstances. Cautions and Comments: Black wal- nut can be toxic to horses and may cause laminitis, severe gastritis, and breathing problems in these animals. These problems are believed to be caused not by the hulls themselves but by a fungus that attacks the green fruit hulls shortly after they fall to the ground. While this suggests that the properly harvested, fungus-free hulls may be safe for use in horses, we are often left with an unanswerable ques- tion of whether or not the hulls we are using are in fact clean of this fungus. Problems have been recorded in cases where horses had merely used black walnut shavings as part of their bed- ding! Concentrations of strong tannins, volatile oils, and various alkaloid ingre- dients contained in the bark, leaves, stems, and hulls of black walnut may lead to vomiting, diarrhea, and gastritis in dogs and cats if ingested in excessive quantities. Remember, anything that can kill a tapeworm has the potential of being harmful to your animal. BORAGE Borago officinalis Borage Family Appearance: Borage looks similar to its relative comfrey except borage has a more unruly stature. Plants may grow to 3 feet tall and quickly sprawl all over a flower bed shortly after rocketing skyward from their emergence as flattened, well-mannered lit- tle rosettes of basal leaves. The unique, 2- to 6-inch-long broadly lance-shaped or nar- rowly oval leaves have wrinkled, prickly haired surfaces that bring to mind two-day- old beard stubble. Flowers are brilliant blue, with five petals and a black-tipped conelike structure at the center of each flower. Flowers are borne in drooping clusters at the upper branches of the plant. Habitat and Range: Native to many parts of Europe and Asia, borage has been widely introduced as a garden plant in North America. It grows just about B Materia Medica 63 b anywhere that has a long enough bloom season to allow for seed development— basically, from the midlatitudes of Canada southward. Cycle and Bloom Season: Borage is a self-seeding annual that blooms from spring to midsummer in most areas. Parts Used: Leaves, flowers, and the oil extracted from seeds Primary Medicinal Activities: Stimulates milk production (galactagogue), stimulates mucous secretions in the bronchi (expecto- rant), astringent, anti-inflammatory, diuret- ic, mildly calming to the nerves, adrenal stimulant Strongest Affinities: Adrenal glands Preparation: The most common uses of this plant require extracting oil from the seed—a process that is impractical for the do-it-yourself herbalist. The leaves can be dried and used within three months for infusions, in capsules, or in bulk form pow- dered and added to your pet’s food. Dried leaves lose their medicinal qualities rather quickly, so use this herb as early after drying as possible. Fresh leaves can be scraped of their prickly hairs and made into a poultice or briefly steamed in their entire form for use as a warm cover dressing for overexerted muscles and minor skin inflammations. Although fresh borage can be fed to horses and other herbivores, most animals dislike the prickly texture of the foliage. Common Uses: Borage is one of many herbs that have been in traditional use for many centuries but nonetheless has not received the scientific attention it deserves. What we do know about borage is that its seeds contain impressive amounts of EFAs, especially gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), a compound that has proven to be extreme- ly useful in the treatment of various liver, cardiovascular, and metabolic disorders. In fact, borage seed oil may contain twice the GLA offered by the oil of evening primrose (Oenothera biennis) seeds. The use of evening primrose should be avoided in sub- jects with blood-clotting disorders. Some scientists claim that the GLA in evening primrose oil can decrease blood cholesterol and blood pressure and cure rheumatoid arthritis. Recent studies suggest that EFA deficien- cies may be strongly associated with many chronic diseases in both people and ani- mals, including atopic eczema, diabetes, and various inflammatory disorders. In dogs and cats, fatty acid disorders are character- ized in the early phases by a dull coat, itchy skin, and excessive shedding. Gamma- linolenic acid is important in the production of prostaglandins, compounds that are Borago officinalis Herbs for Pets 64 critical to the healthy performance of countless metabolic functions—from break- down of carbohydrates, fats, and other essential nutrients into usable forms, to maintenance of cellular integrity and prop- er functioning of smooth-muscle tissues (including the heart, uterus, and vascular system) throughout the body. In other words, animals cannot survive without a proper balance of fatty acids, including GLA, in their bodies. The body does not produce GLA, and therefore it must be received through dietary sources. The problem is that GLA is relatively rare in nature—it occurs in only a few vegetable sources. Borage seed oil is one of the richest GLA supplements avail- able and can be easily administered by breaking a gel capsule onto your pet’s food each day. Ask your holistic veterinarian for recommendations on how much of the oil your animal may need. Borage leaf has also received attention from herbalists who believe that it may be useful for gently strengthening adrenal function, particularly in subjects who have recently undergone extended steroid thera- pies. The adrenal cortex (the outer tissues of the adrenal glands) is chiefly responsible for the body’s production of corticosteroids, the hormones responsible for natural reduction of inflammation. When synthetic corticosteroids are introduced into the body, natural adrenal functions are replaced and the adrenal cortex often begins to shut down its natural production. As a result, many animals who are ending prednisolone or other steroid therapies have depressed adrenal function. Fat metabolism and mineral balances may also be affected if this happens. While borage is by no means as powerful as licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.) in its adrenal-stimulatory actions, it is believed by many herbalists to gently stimulate adrenal function that is slightly depressed, especially when used over an extended period. It may be particularly useful in cases where water retention and high blood pressure are prevalent in an animal’s holistic condition. In these situations, the stronger herb licorice may be contraindicated because of its potential side effects. While the use of borage in this capacity lacks scientific vali- dation, it has nonetheless been used safely and effectively for hundreds of years. The dried leaves may be tinctured (12 drops per 20 pounds of body weight, twice daily) or fed in bulk form (1⁄2 teaspoon sprinkled onto each pound of your animal’s food). Borage also has a folkloric reputation for increasing milk production in nursing mothers (both human and otherwise)—an action that may be attributable to increased hormone production by the adrenal gland. Topically, borage leaves can be applied as a soothing poultice or compress for minor skin irritations. To sum up its poten- tial for topical use, consider borage as a lim- ited alternative to comfrey. Availability: Virtually any nursery or seed catalog that sells herbs is likely to have borage. Propagation and Harvest: Borage prefers dry soil and full sun. Aside from these requirements, it is extremely easy to grow from seed or nursery-raised trans- plants. If you choose to transplant borage from one part of a garden to another, do it while the plants are young because the tap- root grows straight down and is easily dam- aged when removed from the soil. Borage is a successful self-seeding annu- al that drops thousands of tiny seeds almost immediately after blooming. Give the plant plenty of room to sprawl, and consider planting it with other annuals because it may become a nuisance when dozens of young plants emerge beneath your peren- nials during the second year. Harvest the mature leaves while the plant is in full bloom. Borage leaves are B Materia Medica 65 b especially susceptible to mold while they are drying, so never harvest when the leaves are wet and never stack the leaves on top of each other. Dry them in an area that is away from direct sunlight and has plenty of air circulation. Spread the leaves on clean newspapers or a nonmetallic screen and turn them once or twice daily to assure quick, even drying. The dried leaves can then be crumbled and stored in a glass jar for up to three months before they begin to lose their usefulness. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For similar topical applications, look toward comfrey, which is perhaps a more effective alterna- tive when indicated. For anti-inflammatory applications and situations involving depressed adrenal function, such as with Addison’s disease, look toward licorice and astragalus as stronger alternatives. Cautions and Comments: The leaves of this plant contain small amounts of PAs, a potentially toxic group of compounds that may lead to liver damage. Although the presence of these alkaloids in borage is very low (much lower than in comfrey) and require ingestion of large and sustained quantities to become harmful in most ani- mals, borage has nonetheless been banned from human use in Germany. BUGLEWEED Lycopus spp. Mint Family Appearance: Bugleweed also goes by the name of water horehound. The deeply and irregularly lobed leaves of Lycopus americanus differentiate it from other mints (and even other species of Lycopus). Other species of bugleweed (such as the less common L. uniflorus and L. asper) have leaves that are not deep- ly lobed but are simple and coarsely toothed, making them difficult to differ- entiate from other mints such as skull- cap. The easily identified L. americanus remains by far the most common and conspicuous variety in North America, making it the bugleweed to remember. Bugleweed, unlike many other mints, does not have a minty odor. Small whitish to pink flowers are whorled in the leaf axils (the point at which the leaf meets the stem). Stems may be lightly to moderately hairy, especially toward the base of the plant. Habitat and Range: An inhabitant of stream banks and marshes, bugleweed is typically found in the shade beneath wil- lows and other shrubs. Several species of Lycopus are widespread throughout most of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennial, blooming from early to midsummer Lycopus americanus Herbs for Pets 66 Parts Used: Leaves, stems, flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Slows thyroid function, mild cardiac sedative, calms nerves, diuretic, constricts subcu- taneous blood vessels, astringent, cough suppressant Strongest Affinities: Thyroid glands, heart, nervous system Preparation: Although this herb may be useful in dried bulk form or in cap- sules, it doesn’t taste very good, and it may be difficult to administer to a dog or cat in an appreciable quantity that doesn’t just pass through the short digestive tract. An alcohol or glycerin tincture is your best choice here. Common Uses: Although relatively lit- tle research has been done to validate bugleweed’s usefulness in animal sub- jects, it may prove useful in dogs and cats with hyperthyroid conditions. While bugleweed cannot physically correct a diseased thyroid gland and does not work as quickly as synthetic drugs, human studies have confirmed that bugleweed slows the release of the hor- mone thyroxine in the thyroid, making it useful in the treatment of mild forms of hyperthyroidism. Specifically, it should help ease abnormal excitability, relieve acute hyperventilation, slow a rapid heart rate, and relieve spastic coughing in dogs and cats who suffer from sponta- neous hyperthyroidism. It should be noted, though, that small, frequent doses of the herb extract must be given for a period of at least a few days before results are seen. Giving 2–6 drops per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight three times daily is a good starting point. Bugleweed is also useful in many heart and vascular system disorders. It is believed to work in the cardiovascular system in a way that is similar to the drug digitalis—by strengthening the heartbeat while slowing a rapid pulse. But unlike digitalis and other such drugs that are used primarily in humans, bugleweed is virtually free of dangerous side effects. Adding to bugleweed’s usefulness in cardiovascular disorders is its ability to help expel water from the body. This makes it useful in animals with lung fluid associated with weak, rapid pulse and unproductive coughing. However, some extra caution is advised here: bugleweed is believed to suppress the cough response even if such suppres- sion is not conducive to the healing process. In respiratory disorders such as Bordetella or pneumonia, cough sup- pression may be contradictory to the holistic principles of using herbs in the first place and may even be dangerous to the animal. Remember, the primary goal of herbal therapies is to assist the body in its capacity to heal itself, not to interfere with its efforts to do so. If the animal is successful at expelling mucus as a result of persistent coughing, the body is doing its job, and the use of bugleweed is probably contraindicated. See a holistic vet. The nerve-calming and vasoconstric- tor actions of bugleweed make it useful for pain relief in situations that involve irritability and tension. This is true espe- cially when circumstances are com- pounded by injured nerves such as in posttraumatic circumstances where an animal is in pain from a crushing injury, is jumpy and cannot get comfortable, and just paces, whines, and pants. Bugleweed does not contain salicylates, so it can be used for posttraumatic pain relief in cats. It is especially useful in cats with preexisting functional thyroid adenoma or other forms of disease that may contribute to an overactive B Materia Medica 67 b thyroid. In humans, bugleweed is often used by herbalists in the treatment of migraine headaches. Availability: Seeds are available from specialty seed catalogs. Bugleweed herb and herb tinctures are available through natural products retailers. Propagation and Harvest: This herb requires consistently moist soil and at least 50 percent shade cover. For the best results, sow the seeds indoors in February or March then transplant them to an area that gets plenty of shade and water throughout the sum- mer. Plants are ready to harvest when the flowers are just beginning to bloom. The freshly cut herb is the best choice for making your own medicine, but if this isn’t possible, cut the stems at about 3 inches above ground level dur- ing a period when the foliage is com- pletely dry. Hang them in small bunch- es of four to six stems apiece in an airy location away from direct sunlight. When properly stored, the dried herb retains its medicinal potency for at least six months. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For use in hyperthyroidism, bugleweed com- bines especially well with lemon balm (Melissa officinalis). For use in heart and vascular disorders associated with a rapid, erratic pulse, ginkgo and mother- wort serve as substitutes in many cases, and skullcap, hawthorn, garlic, and astragalus should all be investigated as adjuncts. For nervousness associated with abnormal irritability, pain, or rapid heartbeat, bugleweed will combine nicely with valerian, skullcap, hop, or chamomile. When water retention is an associated factor in any of the above conditions, try adding dandelion leaf to the formula as a diuretic aid. Cautions and Comments: Like all members of the mint family, bugleweed is a safe herb with no known toxicity when used sensibly. However, since bugleweed constricts blood vessels and may have hormonal properties, common sense dictates that it should not be used in pregnant or nursing animals. For obvi- ous reasons, bugleweed should not be used in animals with depressed thyroid function. Another point to consider before using bugleweed in your pet is that very little research has been done into the attributes and side effects of bugleweed in some animals. Although it can be safely used in most dogs, cats, and horses, its effects in birds, rodents, and other animals are largely unknown. If in doubt, contact a professional who is familiar with the specific applications of this herb. BURDOCK Arctium lappa Sunflower Family or A. minor Appearance: In its first year of growth, burdock appears as a rosette of large heart-shaped leaves up to 12 inches long. During the second year, the plant continues skyward, often reaching 6–8 feet, while branching out to produce multitudes of thistlelike, light lavender to purple-flowered seed-bearing burrs at the upper reaches of the plant. Each burr contains several small black seeds and is covered by reverse-hooked spines that enable them to stick to anything that brushes by. The entire plant is covered with tiny hairs that give the leaves and the stems a tacky texture similar to that of ultrafine grit sandpaper. The light- brown taproot may weigh 2–3 pounds and extend 2 or more feet below a sec- ond-year plant. This sturdy taproot, combined with the annoying and Herbs for Pets 68 extremely efficient reproductive qualities of the burrs, has earned burdock a hated reputation as a farm and garden enemy. Habitat and Range: Burdock is a Eurasian import that has made its home throughout most of North America. It prefers rich, deep, consistently moist soil and is frequently found in profuse abun- dance along the edges of cultivated fields and at roadsides (particularly where human or livestock traffic can cooperate with the hitchhiking burrs). Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial that blooms in mid- to late summer Parts Used: Root Primary Medicinal Activities: Blood cleansing, liver and gallbladder stimu- lant, diuretic, nutritive Strongest Affinities: Liver, skin Preparation: Although all preparations of this herb are useful, the active con- stituents of this plant must be given in relatively large doses to be of therapeutic advantage. Since most animals don’t like eating it, a strong tincture of fresh or dried root is the most effective prepara- tion. The medicinal ingredients of bur- dock root are extracted well in a glycerin menstruum (solvent), and the flavor of the resulting liquid, or glycerite, is sweet and agreeable to most animals. The fresh roots have a high water content, which is imparted to the finished tincture. A tinc- ture that contains more than 40 percent water spoils quickly. Therefore, it is best to use 100 percent undiluted vegetable glycerin in your mixture. Fresh or dried burdock root can be decocted, as well, and poured over your animal’s food. Be liberal with the quantity—burdock is a healthy food. Common Uses: We cannot emphasize the value of this herb enough in the long-term care of companion animals. Burdock has an ancient and respected reputation as a nutritive liver tonic that helps to clean and build the blood. Just 2.5 ounces of fresh burdock root con- tains up to 61 milligrams of calcium, 77 milligrams of phosphorus, 1.4 milligrams of iron, 0.03 milligrams of thiamine, and 0.05 milligrams of riboflavin. Burdock root is a specific treatment for chronic or acute psoriasis or eczema; it has a strong affinity toward the treat- ment of flaky, oily, or inflammatory skin disorders that can be traced back to liver deficiencies or a general overload of toxic substances in the body (usually the result of a poor diet). It is also useful in the holistic treatment of arthritis, rheumatoid disorders, inflammatory kid- ney and bladder diseases, and virtually any other type of metabolic disorder that may be the result of poor waste elimina- tion. Adding to all of this is a diuretic action that helps in the elimination of waste materials from the body. In simple terms, burdock helps clean the body from the inside out. Burdock contains chemical elements that have been shown to be effective in preventing disease that may result from environmental toxicity. Specifically, bur- dock helps to remove mutagenic sub- stances such as pesticides and airborne pollutants from the bloodstream before they cause harm to the body. Animal studies have indicated that burdock extract has free-radical scavenging quali- ties in the liver, thus weeding out car- cinogenic elements before cellular dam- age can occur. Virtually every living creature is con- tinually subjected to the harmful effects of human society—our companion ani- mals are no exception. The liver is the organ that begins the cleansing process. B Materia Medica 69 b The liver not only filters the blood but contributes bile and numerous enzymes to the digestive tract that are essential to the breakdown and absorption of essen- tial nutrients. By assisting liver function and prompting the efficient removal of systemic waste, absorbed or ingested toxins, and allergens from the body, imbalances such as arthritis, kidney stones, bladder infections, and eczema can be avoided. By helping the liver do its job, we are also relieving pressure from secondary immune functions that need to remain unencumbered in their fight against viruses and other microbes that may have bypassed the liver. Furthermore, if the liver can work at opti- mum efficiency, less solid or toxic waste will reach the kidneys—a set of delicate organs that are vulnerable to the liver’s deficiencies. Burdock is an excellent long-term liver tonic, and it is gentle enough to use in cases of preexisting liver or kidney dis- ease. It is an excellent choice for animals suffering as a result of a poor diet. Just remember, diet is where the road to a long, healthy life begins. Burdock will not replace a good natural diet, but it can help tremendously in allowing the body to utilize the good nutrition it receives. Availability: Fresh organically grown burdock root is available at many health food stores. Dried burdock root and root tincture are available through most herb retailers. Seeds are available through specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Provided you have deep, rich soil for taproots that can penetrate the earth 3 feet, burdock is easy to grow. Burdock likes moist (but not wet) soil, and it prefers to have at least a couple of hours of shade each day. Sow the seeds as you would carrots, in early spring. The roots are ready after the leaves die back in the fall of the first year. Second-year roots can be used if dug in the spring, but remember that biennials die after their second year of growth and the roots lose potency as they approach their demise. Burdock roots can be refrigerated for several weeks after harvest, or they can be chopped and dried, made into tinc- ture, or decocted for immediate use. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Dandelion root serves well as an alternative to bur- dock. For treatment of flaky or itchy skin problems, burdock can be supplement- ed with licorice, red clover, dandelion, or yellow dock. As a liver aid in conditions associated with chronic constipation, burdock can be supplemented with dan- delion, chicory, turkey rhubarb, yellow dock, or Oregon grape. In cases of pre- existing liver damage resulting from chemical toxicity or vaccinosis, use the Arctium minor Herbs for Pets 70 burdock with milk thistle or licorice. As an adjunct to an immune-support for- mula, combine burdock with echinacea or astragalus. Cautions and Comments: This is one of the safest herbs available to humans and animals. In essence, burdock is a nutraceutical, a food that also offers medicinal attributes. No toxicity has been noted with this herb. CALENDULA Calendula officinalis Sunflower Family Appearance: This herb is also known as pot marigold. The bright yellow, orange, or red-orange flowers of calen- dula are a familiar sight in gardens and landscape designs found everywhere. Calendula officinalis is a small plant that seldom exceeds 18 inches in height. The lance-shaped or oblong alternate leaves have coarse surfaces and are borne on sturdy branching stems. Calendula should not be confused with other marigolds, namely French marigolds, and other members of the Tagetes genus of the sunflower family, which have a pungent odor and much different leaf characteristics. Habitat and Range: Originally a native of Europe and Africa, calendula is a culti- vated plant throughout most of the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: The word calendula is derived from calends (the first day of the Roman month) because the plant was thought to bloom on the new moon of each month. While calen- dula really doesn’t keep such an accurate calendar, it does remain in a constant and generous state of bloom throughout most of its annual life span. Parts Used: Flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- inflammatory, increases lymph circula- tion, heals wounds, astringent, antibac- terial, antifungal, anti-tumor, liver stimu- lant, promotes menstruation (emmena- gogue) Strongest Affinities: Skin and mucous membranes Preparation: Water or oil infusion, tinc- ture, poultice, salve, ointment Common Uses: Calendula is among the first herbs to consider in minor first aid situations. A broad array of medicinal compounds in the flowers of the plant (various essential oils, flavonoids, saponins, triterpene alcohols, carotenes, and others) combine to help speed cell reproduction and inhibit bacteria and fungi at the site of injury. For minor cuts, insect bites, abra- sions, and postsurgical incisions, a calen- dula salve applied externally brings quick, soothing relief to pain and swelling, while lending wound-healing, antimicrobial properties to the body’s healing effort. Infusions of the flowers are effective as a soothing and healing skin wash for various forms of inflamma- tory dermatitis, such as those caused by fleabites, poison ivy, eczema, and sun- burn. The infection-fighting, skin-healing nature of this plant makes it useful for treating burns as well. A cooled water infusion may be used as an eyewash for conjunctivitis, where the mild but pre- dictable astringency of the plant com- bines with its bacteria-fighting properties to reduce irritation and infection. To make an eyewash or skin rinse, refer to chapter 1. Internally, an infusion or tincture of the flower may be used in treating C Materia Medica 71 c inflammation or ulceration of the diges- tive or urinary tracts, where it serves in the drainage of lymph-engorged tissues and reduces inflammation. It may also prove beneficial in the treatment of can- didiasis, a fungal infection of the mucous membranes in the mouths and digestive tracts of birds, cats, horses, and some- times dogs. The antifungal qualities of this herb also make it a possible option for topical treatment of chromomycosis, a fungal infection of the skin in cows, horses, dogs, cats, and amphibians, or for the treatment of entomophthoromy- cosis, a fungal infection of the nostrils, mouth, or lips of horses. While virtually no scientific data exist to validate the effectiveness of calendula against these three forms of disease, calendula’s safety and reputed effectiveness as a broad- spectrum antifungal agent make it an option worth trying. Preparations containing calendula have been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic colitis. And animal studies have shown that the saponin constituents in calendula may possess antitumor activities. Availability: Over thirty varieties of cal- endula are available at nurseries every- where. Propagation and Harvest: Sow seeds in early spring or transplant the starts after the danger of frost is past. Calendula likes moderately rich soil and full sun. It is not picky about pH—as long as the soil is not excessively alkaline or acidic, calendula will do just fine. Once established, plants self-sow from their prolific seed production. Seedlings that emerge each spring should be thinned to about 6 inches apart, so you can have a continuous, relatively carefree supply of calendula. Harvest the flowers when- ever they are in full bloom. They can then be made into an herbal preparation while they are fresh, or you can dry them indoors for use in the near future. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For use in first aid salves, calendula combines espe- cially well with comfrey and Saint-John’s- wort. To increase its effectiveness in anti- fungal uses (internally or externally), try adding bee balm, Oregon grape, or licorice. For urinary or digestive tract inflammations, calendula can be coupled with corn silk, marshmallow, or plantain. Cautions and Comments: Although calendula is without question one of the safest herbs, it does have a reputation for stimulating menstruation. In some stud- ies it has been shown to possess abortifa- cient (abortion-causing) activities in rodents, so it should be avoided during early pregnancy. Calendula may contain a very small measure of salicylic acid, a Calendula officinalis Herbs for Pets 72 constituent that is potentially toxic to cats. Although this compound is likely confined to the leaves and stems of the plant and does not occur in quantities that are likely to be of immediate danger to cats, its presence should be taken into account prior to long-term internal use. CATNIP Nepeta cataria Mint Family Appearance: Wild catnip is always a wonderful discovery. Its pungent tangy- mint aroma wafts to the nose with the slightest disturbance of the plant. And the flavor and soothing effects of the tea are likely to please even the most discriminating palate. Characteristically a mint, catnip has square stems and oppo- site leaves. Leaves are petiolate (stemmed), coarsely but often bluntly toothed, and nearly heart shaped to broadly lance shaped. Once one has become familiar with this plant, the aroma is a sure giveaway. The entire plant is distinctively fuzzy with an almost flannel-like texture. Unlike most other mints, which bloom in whorls at the upper leaf axils or in terminate clusters or spires, catnip blooms at both the upper leaf axils and in spikelike terminate clusters. Habitat and Range: Catnip is a Eurasian import that is now widespread in North America. It likes full sun and rich, moist soil, and is most frequently found in disturbed areas such as along irrigation channels and at the edges of cultivated fields. Unfortunately, this char- acteristic often makes it difficult for the herbalist or wild food forager to find uncontaminated plants. Fortunately, cat- nip can be found at many nurseries. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from late spring to midsummer Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers are collected before seeds begin to develop. Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, sedative, antispasmodic, helps alleviate vomiting (antiemetic), feline-euphoric, diuretic Strongest Affinities: Digestive and nervous systems Preparation: Fresh or dried chopped herb, water infusion, tincture, or, of course, stuffed in a catnip toy Common Uses: Catnip is a gentle gas reliever and antispasmodic for easing flatulence and stomach upsets. It also acts as a mild sedative to help calm the nerves and promote restful sleep in most animals. Due to an ingredient called nepetalactone, cats become intoxicated Nepeta cataria C Materia Medica 73 c when they sniff this plant. The effect of the herb when ingested is relaxing in a different way, calming to the stomach and relaxing to the nerves but without feline-erotic visions of candy-coated mice. Interestingly, about 20 percent of our feline friends do not experience a euphoric response to catnip. This is an excellent herb to consider for a high- strung animal with a nervous stomach, especially if episodes of vomiting are pre- cipitated by stressful events such as run- ning the vacuum cleaner, having the neighbors and their screaming child over for dinner, or—worse yet—bringing another kitten into the “royal palace.” You can administer 12–20 drops (0.25 to 0.5 milliliter) of a glycerin-based catnip tincture for every 20 pounds of an ani- mal’s body weight, ten to twenty min- utes prior to being subjected to stressful circumstances. For travel or other pro- longed periods of stress, the tincture can be added to the animal’s drinking water—12 drops per 8 ounces of water is a good starting dose. If the animal does not respond, try adding 6 drops at a time, until the desired calming effect is evident. Dropping a few fresh leaves into the animal’s drinking water may work as well. You can also try feeding dried cat- nip to your pet by putting it onto her food at a dose of 1⁄8 to 1⁄2 teaspoon per pound of food fed. Just remember that this might make kitty roll around in her dinner! Availability: Catnip has become a roadside weed in many areas. If you are not so fortunate, the plants or seeds are available through many nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Gather the leaves, stems, and flowers before the plant goes to seed. The herb can then be dried indoors. Spread the herb loosely on a clean sheet of paper, rearranging it frequently to prevent mold. The herb is ready for storage when it is crispy dry. Alternatives and Adjuncts: To help settle an upset stomach and to prevent nervous vomiting, catnip combines well with fennel. Chamomile serves as an effective adjunct or alternative in these circumstances. For motion sickness, a pinch of ginger can be added to a tea- spoon of dried, powdered catnip. The combination can then be given to a dog or cat in a small gel capsule. One capsule should do for a cat; a dog may require two or three, depending on her size. Cautions and Comments: The herb is safe, but use it sparingly in pregnant ani- mals, as it has been theorized that the volatile oils it contains may be passed on to the fetus, the result of which is unknown. CAYENNE Capsicum spp. Nightshade Family Appearance: Like many common names, the words capsicum and cayenne are used as generic terms for a broad range of small, very hot chili peppers. Most of these peppers are genetically engineered variations of two species of the Capsicum genus: C. frutescens and C. annuum. There are dozens of varieties, but they all share a similar appearance: shiny oval to lance-shaped, 1- to 5-inch- long leaves; small, white, star-shaped flowers; and sturdy, sometimes vinelike stems that reach anywhere from 1 to 3 feet tall when mature. Habitat and Range: Originally a native of tropical regions of South and Central America, virtually all of the capsicums are now cultivated in areas throughout the world with long growing seasons. In Herbs for Pets 74 northern climes, capsicum can be grown as an attractive houseplant. Cycle and Bloom Season: Wild South American capsicums are perennial plants that can reach 7 feet in height, but in North America most capsicums are culti- vated as annuals. Most capsicums bloom in early summer and produce ripe fruit by mid-August. Parts Used: Fruits Primary Medicinal Activities: Warms and reddens the skin (rubefacient), dilates blood vessels (vasodilator), stops bleeding (hemostatic), counterirritant, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, strength- ens tissues (tonic) Strongest Affinities: Skin and circula- tory system Preparation: For internal uses, the dried and powdered fruits are most com- monly contained in gel capsules. The whole or powdered fruits may be used in oil infusions, salves, ointments, or tinc- tures. Various brands of capsaicin creams and ointments are commercially avail- able at drugstores for topical treatment of arthritis, muscle aches, stiffness, and other conditions. Common Uses: Capsicum is reliable in its activity as a peripheral vasodilator. Used internally, it acts to warm the body by quickly dilating small capillaries and increasing circulation to the skin and extremities. (This is why sweating and flushed skin is experienced when we eat foods containing cayenne.) Because of this activity, capsicum is commonly used in the systemic treatment of impaired blood circulation, and because it triggers the outward movement of blood throughout the body, it is often added as a “carrier” for the active components of other herbs. Its effect in this capacity can be quite dramatic, especially when it is combined with herbs that have an affin- ity toward the skin or extremities. By itself, capsicum is useful for opening cap- illary occlusions that are the by-product of a crushing injury, and it is considered a specific remedy for chronically defi- cient peripheral circulation—situations characterized by continuously cold paws, hands, or feet. Capsicum is also regarded as a circulatory stimulant for the lungs and may be useful for improv- ing pulmonary efficiency in animals with hypostatic pneumonia (a condition aris- ing from poor blood circulation through vascular structures of the lungs) or other conditions where edema or other factors are interfering with proper blood circula- tion in pulmonary tissues. In most internal applications, cap- sicum is administered once per day in the form of a gel capsule. For a dog or a cat, the capsule would contain a small pinch of the powder. For horses and other large animals, several full large capsules may be needed to bring about desired results. Finding the correct dose is contingent upon the specifics of the individual animal and the situation at hand. Topically, capsicum works as a contact rubefacient, serving to quickly open subcu- taneous capillaries while acting as a nerve block and reducing pain at the site of appli- cation. These topical attributes make cap- sicum especially useful for therapies that are to be confined to a specific portion of the body, such as those for stiff or arthritic knees that may benefit from the herb’s instantaneous warming effect. The com- pound chiefly responsible for this activity is called capsaicin, and in addition to its capacity to block pain and increase circula- tion, capsaicin has been shown to activate the body’s own anti-inflammatory media- tors at the site where it is applied. It not C Materia Medica 75 c only helps to reduce pain and congestion in arthritic joints but also acts as an assis- tant to the body’s internal anti-inflammato- ry mechanisms. These combined actions make topical preparations of capsicum use- ful for safely relieving the symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. On the top of our list of uses for cap- sicum, though, is its effectiveness at stopping bleeding. It’s interesting to note that while capsicum has such a pro- found ability to increase blood circula- tion when taken internally or applied onto the skin, its effects are quite oppo- site when applied to the site of internal or external bleeding. To stop the bleed- ing of a barbed wire cut, a claw that was clipped too short, or any other minor to moderate wound where profuse bleed- ing does not coagulate readily on its own, capsicum powder, or ground cayenne from the kitchen cabinet, can be liberally applied directly to the site of injury. Unless bleeding is emanating from a fairly large vessel, the result is like- ly to be instantaneous, and believe it or not, capsicum really doesn’t hurt much when applied to an open wound. Availability: Readily available wherever culinary spices are sold. Capsicum plants are available through virtually any nurs- ery that stocks vegetable plants. Propagation and Harvest: Capsicum is often slow to start from seed, so it is best to purchase young plants. Like most peppers, capsicums that are planted out- doors require warm, sunny days and nighttime temperatures that seldom fall below 55 degrees Fahrenheit (F) in order to produce fruit. Many varieties are quite suitable as houseplants. Alternatives and Adjuncts: To stop bleeding, capsicum combines well with yarrow. For circulatory problems, hawthorn, ginkgo, ginger, and yarrow should all be considered as well. Cautions and Comments: Contrary to what may seem obvious, capsicum does not cause irritation to the digestive tract when consumed in moderate quantities, but the key word here is moderate. You should not feed capsicum to animals who have a sensitive digestive tract or inflammatory digestive or urinary system disease unless you have a full under- standing of all underlying conditions. When used properly and in moderation, capsicum is a safe herb, but extra care and attention are needed to assure that capsicum is truly indicated. No two ani- mals are identical, and where capsicum may serve to benefit one, it can cause painful irritation to another. In other words, it is best to have your animal examined by a holistic veterinarian before proceeding with any internal Capsicum sp. Herbs for Pets 76 therapy that includes capsicum. Cap- sicum is a strong irritant to mucous membranes and should always be kept away from the eyes and nose. This is the stuff that bear-defense pepper spray is made from. Its topical use should be avoided with animals who have hyper- sensitive skin. Although capsicum is gen- erally considered safe during pregnancy, we recommend that its use be limited to topical applications. In our opinion, strong urinary tract irritants should not be used in pregnant or lactating animals. Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water after handling any form of this herb, and don’t touch your eyes, lips, or any other mucous membranes for about thirty minutes after. CHAMOMILE Matricaria recutita Sunflower Family Appearance: German chamomile is characterized by its 1⁄2- to 1-inch flowers, each with a yellow disk surrounded by ten to twenty white rays (petals). The com- mon name chamomile is used in reference to dozens of related species, but most of the medicinal uses are isolated to two genera, M. recutita (German chamomile) and Chamaemelum nobile (Roman chamomile), and their respective sub- species. The differences between these two groups of chamomile rest in their life cycles, the number of flowers they pro- duce, and their overall size. German chamomile is an annual plant that can grow to 2 feet tall, producing numerous flowers on each of its many stems. Roman chamomile, on the other hand, is a creep- ing perennial that seldom exceeds 1 foot in height and produces fewer but larger (1-inch-wide) flowers. Both German and Roman chamomiles share a nearly identi- cal range of therapeutic usefulness, but German chamomile is by far the more popular medicine because it has received much more research attention and has long been regarded by herbalists as a more potent medicine than Roman chamomile. For the purposes of this book, our primary focus is on German chamomile; there is, however, a generally overlooked wild relative of cultivated vari- eties of chamomile that also deserves a place in the animal herbalist’s repertory: pineapple weed (M. matricarioides). Pineapple weed looks, smells, and even tastes much like its cultivated cousins, but its flowers have no petals. This small way- side weed is often found growing in incon- spicuous ground-hugging mats in vacant lots, on road margins, and sometimes right in the middle of a driveway! Habitat and Range: A Native of Europe and western Asia, chamomile is cultivated worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: Chamomile is notorious for its continuous bloom. In areas where the occurrence of frost is rare, chamomile often produces flowers throughout the year. Parts Used: Flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- spasmodic, expels intestinal gas, anti- inflammatory, sedative, antimicrobial, stimulates digestion (bitter), heals wounds, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Skin, digestive tract, liver, nervous system, mucous membranes, smooth-muscle tissues Preparation: Water or oil infusion, tinc- ture, salve, ointment, fomentation Common Uses: Chamomile is a mild sedative, antispasmodic, and digestive tonic that is safe, gentle, and effective in C Materia Medica 77 c a broad spectrum of applications. The herb tea or tincture is helpful for indiges- tion, gas, and vomiting. Chamomile is perhaps the first herb to reach for in cases of digestive upset that arises from nervousness and hyperexcitability. The chemistry of chamomile is complex, and its medicinal activities are not attributa- ble to any single class of constituents but rather to a synergistic sum of all its parts. However, dozens of scientific studies (using both animals and humans) have given us solid information about which of chamomile’s chemical compounds contribute to its effectiveness as a holis- tic healing device. For example, ape- genin, chamazulene (and its precursor, matricin) and other volatile oil con- stituents of the flowers have been shown to be strong antispasmodic agents both in and on the body, as have several of chamomile’s flavonoid constituents. In the digestive tract, chamomile serves to ease nervous spasms, helps to expel gas, aids in the production of bile to improve digestion, and reduces inflammation. All of these activities amount to an excellent remedy for chronic or acute gastric dis- orders, including various forms of inflam- matory bowel disease. For inflammations of the skin, including those caused by fleabites, contact allergies, and various bacterial or fungal infections, a cooled water infusion of the flowers can be used as a soothing, healing, antimicrobial rinse. For conjunctivitis, whether it be from bacterial infection or the result of air- borne irritants or allergies, the cooled infusion can be carefully strained through a paper coffee filter, diluted with saline solution (the end product should be transparent and light yellow), and used as an anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial eyewash that can be applied liberally several times per day until the inflammation subsides. Chamomile has also been shown to have a tonic (constricting and strength- ening) effect on smooth-muscle tissues throughout the body, including the heart, bladder, and especially the uterus. While uterine tonics may be beneficial before pregnancy and during late-term pregnancy, herbs that constrict uterine tissues are generally contraindicated dur- ing early pregnancy. In our experiences chamomile serves as a general-purpose calming herb that can be fed to animals as a “first try” rem- edy for any variety of spasmodic or anx- iety-related problems. Because it tastes good, is soluble in water, and is safe for most animals, its use should be consid- ered before stronger, less-palatable anti- spasmodics or sedatives are employed. Chamomile’s usefulness in expelling worms is often overlooked in favor of faster acting herbs (such as wormwood, black walnut hulls, or garlic), but it Matricaria recutita Herbs for Pets 78 should not be. Chamomile is relatively nontoxic when compared to most other “herbal wormers.” While it doesn’t work as quickly as the other anthelmintics, it does work, especially for roundworms and whipworms, and it offers anti- inflammatory activities that help coun- teract the effect parasites often have on intestinal mucosa. Pineapple weed (M. matricarioides) is even more pronounced in its worm-expelling activities. For internal uses, we prefer a glyc- erin tincture of the herb because it can be administered in small, easy-to-feed doses of 0.25–0.50 milliliter per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily as needed to suppress symptoms. The sweet-tasting glycerin tincture can be administered directly into the animal’s mouth, or it can be added to the animal’s drinking water. The glycerite is also useful in treating gingivitis, especially when small pro- portions of stronger antimicrobial herb extracts (such as thyme, rosemary, bee balm, Oregon grape, or echinacea) are added. To use chamomile in this capacity, the tincture can be applied directly to the gums of the animal with a cotton swab. Chamomile extract can also be used in a vaporizer or steamed from boiling water for inhalation treatment of asth- ma, allergies, bronchitis, and the like. In homeopathic form, chamomile is used for teething puppies to keep them from chewing everything in sight. Availability: Chamomile can be pur- chased from any health food retailer and is available at most supermarkets. The plants are available through most nurs- eries, as are the seeds. Propagation and Harvest: Chamomile is easy to grow in all climates, and once established its promiscuous, free-seeding character yields abundant growth year after year. If left to its unruly self, it is like- ly to find its way out of flower beds and into pathways and beyond. Chamomile blooms continuously throughout the growing season. The flow- ers can be plucked off at any time and dried indoors on a piece of clean paper or a nonmetallic screen. Fresh flowers are useful, too, and in fact are a stronger option for use in skin rinses and against intestinal parasites, but the dried flowers have a much more pleasant flavor. Alternatives and Adjuncts: In cases of nervous stomach problems and gas, look to catnip, fennel, and bee balm. Chamomile combines well with calendu- la, juniper leaves, or uva ursi in anti- inflammatory skin rinses. For irritable bowel, diarrhea, and other gastric disor- ders, consider plantain, slippery elm, and marshmallow. For inflammatory urinary tract problems, chamomile combines with corn silk, plantain, uva ursi, white oak bark, couch grass, and marshmal- low. For use against worms, chamomile can be combined at a 4:1 ratio (four parts chamomile to one part other herb) with garlic, Oregon grape, organically raised goldenseal, wormwood, or black walnut hulls. Cautions and Comments: Chamomile is, without doubt, one of the safest herbs in existence, but some animals (and humans too) are extremely allergic to this plant and its relatives. Always check for sensitivity before feeding this herb by applying a small amount of the prepara- tion to an animal’s skin. Then if no reac- tions are observed, feed just a drop or two and watch for any changes in your animal. Studies suggest that excessive use of chamomile during pregnancy may increase fetus reabsorption and inhibit fetus growth in some animals. C Materia Medica 79 c CHAPARRAL Larrea tridentata Caltrop Family Appearance: Chaparral (also common- ly known as creosote bush) is the pre- dominant low-desert shrub of the U.S. Southwest. The abundance of this shrub almost makes a description of it unneces- sary, as many who live or travel between the Pacific Ocean and inland states of the Southwest invariably find themselves within what seems to be an endless expanse of these ancient plants. But, for those who are unfamiliar with the plant, chaparral is the chest-high to 10-feet-tall dark green bush with spindly wind- whipped branches, which contributes to the highway hypnosis we all suffer while driving to and from Las Vegas. The leaves are tiny (1⁄8 inch long) and have a greasy- leathery texture. The bark is reddish brown toward the base of the plant and progressively lighter (to almost white) on the smaller limbs. Flowers are minute and yellow, developing into oddly fuzzy seed-bearing capsules. Chaparral is one of the oldest living inhabitants of our planet, with some individual plants esti- mated to be over ten thousand years old! Habitat and Range: Profusely abun- dant from the deserts of central Texas westward through the southern half of New Mexico and Arizona to the deserts of southern California and Nevada. Cycle and Bloom Season: Chaparral often blooms according to precipitation. Generally, this occurs any time from March through May. Parts Used: Leaves, flowers, fruits Primary Medicinal Activities: Inhibits bacterial reproduction (bacteriostatic), antifungal, kills certain types of amoeba (amoebicidal), antioxidant, helps with blood cleansing Strongest Affinities: Skin, blood, liver Preparation: A decoction is used exter- nally as a skin and coat rinse or as an ingredient in salves and ointments. For small animals, the fomentation method of application is strongly advised (see chapter 1) because this form of prepara- tion allows the active constituents of the herb to remain on the body longer and prohibits the animal from licking off the decoction. Salves or ointments that con- tain a large percentage of chaparral should also be kept out of the mouth of the animal. For horses or other large ani- mals, this is less of an issue, especially if the decoction is applied to portions of the body that are beyond reach of the animal’s mouth. Larrea tridentata Herbs for Pets 80 Because this plant is naturally designed to resist harsh desert elements, it is poorly soluble in water. Therefore, decoctions and alcohol-based tinctures are the best methods of extraction for this plant. Common Uses: American Indians of the Southwest have used this plant for centuries—for everything from the internal treatment of tumors and hepatic (liver) diseases to topical skin treatments, including sunscreen, for themselves and their animals. Today, herbalists use the plant as a strong bacteriostatic and antioxidant agent in the treatment of blood and liver disorders. However, recent scientific research and documented incidents have raised both hope and concern. Some studies have shown that chemical constituents in chaparral may inhibit the growth of cancerous cells, while others have shown exactly the opposite. And recently, a few accounts of serious liver damage (in humans) have been attributed to this herb. Many theories as to why this plant may suddenly be harming us after hundreds of years of safe medicinal use. One the- ory is that perhaps humanity and chaparral are evolving away from one another. Nevertheless, thousands of people still use chaparral on a daily basis, and it remains a popular herbal medicine in natural products markets worldwide. In animals, chaparral has been shown to have strong antifungal, antibacterial, and, remarkably, amoebicidal proper- ties. The constituent believed to be responsible for most of chaparral’s medicinal activity is a lignan compound known as nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA). Nordihydroguaiaretic acid may be effective in treating various forms of amebiasis, including Entamoeba histolyt- ica, an amoeba that can be passed from humans to the digestive tracts of dogs (but rarely to other animals) and causes acute or chronic colitis characterized by persistent diarrhea. It has also been proven effective against Salmonella, Streptococcus, Phylococcus aureus, Baci- llus subtilis, and various other pathogens and molds. Unfortunately, chaparral’s toxicity prohibits it from most internal uses. But its remarkable antimicrobial properties make it an excellent broad- spectrum topical agent that is as useful for the animal handler as it is for the ani- mal receiving care. Used as a hand rinse before and after handling animals who may be carrying Salmonella or other transmittable pathogens or as a rinse applied prior to handling animals who are prone to infec- tion from human-carried pathogens, a decoction of chaparral serves an effective two-way adjunct to soap and water. For external treatment of fungal infections of the hooves, nails, or skins of various large and small animals, chaparral is among the first herbs to try. Just remember, keep chaparral from going into the ani- mal’s digestive tract. Availability: Available through herb retailers; profusely available in the low desert regions of the southwestern U.S. and Mexico. Propagation and Harvest: In arid regions, chaparral can be transplanted into the garden as a slow-growing land- scape shrub. The leaves, twigs, and flow- ers can be harvested any time. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For anti- bacterial skin rinses, bee balm, chamomile, sage, thyme, or rosemary can be used. For treatment of psoriasis and other inflamma- tory skin disorders, chaparral combines well with calendula or aloe. C Materia Medica 81 c Cautions and Comments: Ingestion of any form of this plant in large enough quantities may lead to liver damage. For this reason, it is a good idea to take extra measures to assure that your animal does not lick off external applications of chap- arral after they are applied. Therefore, we recommend that you wrap dogs, cats, and other small animals in a towel after a skin rinse has been applied. CHICKWEED Stellaria media Pink Family Appearance: Common chickweed is a weak-stemmed sprawling annual that is commonly found in lush, low-growing mats or entangled in other growth (oftentimes in rose beds). Chickweed exhibits a unique characteristic that makes it easy to differentiate from all look-alikes: a line of minute hairs runs up only one side of the stem; switching sides at each pair of leaves. Opposite leaves may grow to 11⁄2 inches and range in shape from broadly lance shaped to oval but always have distinct points at their tips. Flowers are small (1⁄4 inch across) and white with five petals that are clefted at their tips to give the false appearance of ten petals. Chickweed blooms continuously, each time drop- ping its seeds as it continues its sprawl. Habitat and Range: Chickweed inhab- its moist meadows, ravines, and dis- turbed areas throughout all of North America, from the Brooks Range of Alaska to all points southward. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms and free-seeds itself contin- uously throughout growth Parts Used: Freshly harvested leaves, flowers, and stems Primary Medicinal Activities: Sooth- ing to the skin; lubricates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes (demulcent), diuretic, tonic Strongest Affinities: Skin and diges- tive tract Preparation: Fresh whole plant, fresh juice of the plant, water or oil infusion, salves, ointments. If you have access to a juicer, try this: Juice enough of the fresh plants to fill an ice-cube tray (preferably a stainless steel one), then freeze it. If the tray is stored in a resealable bag and kept in a freezer, the frozen juice cubes keeps for about three months. Individual cubes can be thawed and the juice used as needed, internally or externally. Common Uses: Whether for human or animal purposes, chickweed is a safe, deli- cious resource for providing soothing, Stellaria media Herbs for Pets 82 cooling relief for virtually any form of minor irritation. Internally, chickweed acts to soothe, protect, and mildly lubricate the upper digestive tract. Fed in its entire fresh form, it is useful for relieving minor esophageal irritations, such as those caused by something Rover ate that had rough edges, or even a minor bite or sting that Godzilla the iguana suffered from snapping at an insect with bad manners. Chickweed can also be fed to dogs or cats as a source of lubrication and light roughage that may assist in the expulsion of hair balls. For mild cases of stomach upset that are believed to be the result of an irritated stomach lining or for a mild case of colitis, fresh chickweed or chick- weed juice is indicated as a mild first aid tonic for dogs, cats, and horses or any other herbivore. If chickweed is not astrin- gent or mucilaginous enough to bring relief, the therapy can be progressively “upgraded” by using stronger herbs. Chickweed is nutritious and an excellent nutritive and digestive tonic for birds. Chickweed poultices are useful for cooling and soothing minor burns and skin irrita- tions, particularly when associated with itching and dryness. Availability: Chickweed grows just about everywhere in the world. If you cannot find a wild source, many special- ty seed catalogs now carry the seed. Don’t bother with the dried herb you are likely to find in the marketplace—it just isn’t the same! Propagation and Harvest: Because chickweed is a vigorous free-seeder, transplanting it into the garden is as easy as grabbing a handful of the plants and spreading them on a moist flower bed. Give your chickweed plenty of water, rich soil, and at least four hours of shade each day, and it will likely be at your service forever. Although this plant likes to sprawl, its delicate (and delicious) nature seldom poses a problem to the weed-weary gardener. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Aloe juice or gel is a better option for burns and irritations of the skin. In salves and oint- ments, chickweed combines nicely with calendula or Saint-John’s-wort. For cases of gastrointestinal irritation that will not respond to chickweed’s gentle nature, slippery elm, plantain, or marshmallow should be considered. Cautions and Comments: Generally, chickweed is considered to be a safe medicinal food plant—it can be fed to most animals in whatever quantities they desire. Large quantities of chickweed, however, can have a laxative effect. Always keep in mind that some animals may be allergic to chickweed. Perhaps the most important thing to consider with the use of this plant is that it often lives among hated weeds that have been subjected to herbicides, and it is fre- quently found in waste areas that are subject to various contaminants. CLEAVERS Galium aparine Madder Family Appearance: The Galium genus is large and widespread, with no fewer than thirteen species in the Pacific Northwest alone. Species can be divid- ed into two general groups: perennial and annual. In essence, the annual vari- eties are sprawlers and climbers, often forming ground-covering mats with much weaker taproots and more deli- cate stems and leaves than perennial species. All Galium plants have square stems and slender leaves that grow in whorled clusters like bicycle spokes of two to eight leaves, depending on the C Materia Medica 83 c species. Flowers are small and white to greenish in color. Galium aparine (see photo) is a widely distributed annual variety that has earned most of the attention of the herb market because of its delicate, aromatic, and readily water soluble nature. It has earned the com- mon names of “cleavers” and “tangle- weed” because of the thousands of infinitesimal, reversed hooks on the angles of its stems. These tiny hooks enable the plant to cling to just about anything in a fashion similar to the way static-charged hair clings to clothing. This allows cleavers to reproduce effec- tively because the delicate seed-bearing foliage is easily uprooted and carried away by passersby. Perennial varieties such as northern bedstraw (G. boreale) do not share this unique characteristic. Habitat and Range: Cleavers (G. aparine) and most other annual varieties prefer moist habitats and are commonly found growing in shaded ravines and along streams. Northern bedstraw (G. boreale) and other perennial species can tolerate a much wider diversity of habi- tats and are commonly found along road margins and in dry, sunny areas. Both cleavers and northern bedstraw are com- mon throughout North America and most of the Northern Hemisphere, up to about 6,000 feet in elevation. Cycle and Bloom Season: Annual or perennial (depending on species). Most Galium spp. bloom in early to midsummer. Parts Used: Entire fresh plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Tonic, helps with blood cleansing, diuretic, astrin- gent, anti-inflammatory, heals wounds Strongest Affinities: Lymph system, urinary tract, skin Preparation: Juice, tincture, or tea of the fresh plant Common Uses: Herbalists have long regarded cleavers as a valuable lymphat- ic tonic. In essence, the lymph system is responsible for “washing” body tissues. Throughout the body, lymph is passed across capillary barriers to remove waste materials from healthy cell communities. The lymph is then returned to the blood- stream, where in a properly functioning body it is cleaned of waste material by the liver and kidneys. The waste then (hopefully) leaves the body via the usual urinary and digestive outlets. Cleavers is used in virtually any condi- tion that is characterized by general or localized swelling or in situations where lymphatic circulation has been impaired by the formation of scar tissue, ulceration, or infection. Although the activities of cleavers are subtle, the herb is believed to Galium aparine Herbs for Pets 84 increase circulation of lymph in impaired areas of the body through dilation of small, almost cellular-level capillaries. This would explain the remarkable ability of cleavers in helping speed the healing of gastric ulcers and the herb’s long-standing reputation for aiding drainage of lymph- engorged cysts, tumors, and inflamed tis- sues of the urinary tract. In addition to its lymphatic qualities, cleavers lends mild astringent activities to its job of relieving inflammations of the upper digestive and urinary tracts. In cats, these activities make cleavers a safe long-term aid in the treat- ment of feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD), also known as feline urinary syn- drome (FUS), and the herb may also be useful for chronic low-grade kidney inflammation. Because cleavers is thought to increase lymphatic flow throughout body tissues, it may be useful as an alterative therapy in the treatment of various skin disorders. From a holistic perspective, skin problems such as psoriasis and eczema are usually the result of poor elimination of systemic waste. Instead of being “washed” out by the lymph system, “filtered” by the liver and kidneys, and eliminated from the body, the waste materials build up in the body, resulting in diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and conditions such as flaky, oily, or itchy skin. By improving lymphatic circulation, a critical level of sys- temic waste management is assisted. Although relatively little scientific research has been done to validate these claims, its long history of use and safe track record make cleavers a worthwhile tonic for those who are willing to accept natural healing based on anecdotal evidence. A typical starting dose of the glycerin tincture for dogs, cats, birds, and other animals is 0.5–1.0 milliliter per 50 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. Horses, rab- bits, and other herbivores can be fed the fresh herb in their daily meals. Availability: Cleavers is a common wild plant throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. It is available in various forms at local herb retailers, but remember that the dried herb (or any preparation of the dried herb) is inferior medicine compared to the fresh plant. If you plan to purchase a commercial preparation of cleavers, check the label to make sure that it was produced from the fresh plant—otherwise, you might be buying an expensive but powerless herb. Fresh plant tinctures, in our opin- ion, is the best choice. Propagation and Harvest: A few specialty seed catalogs offer cleavers (G. aparine) seed, and many nurseries sell starts of “sweet woodruff,” a generic term for any variety of perennial Galium spp. sold as bedding plants. While these cultivars likely possess medicinal attrib- utes, exactly how they measure up to the “herbalist-approved” G. aparine is unknown. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For prob- lems involving the lymphatic system, cleavers combines with calendula, echi- nacea, or astragalus. For skin and liver problems, cleavers is best if combined with alterative, diuretic, and liver- strengthening and stimulating herbs— dandelion, burdock, Oregon grape, milk thistle, and yellow dock should be con- sidered. For treatment of tumors, cleavers is traditionally combined with red clover, licorice, violet, or aloe. For urinary tract problems, check out corn silk, marshmallow, and couch grass as alternatives or adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Cleavers is a safe herb. No contraindications have been noted with animal or human use, although allergic reaction is a possibility to consider before feeding. C Materia Medica 85 c COLTSFOOT Petasites and Sunflower Family Tussilago species Appearance: The common name of coltsfoot is shared by two distinctly dif- ferent genera, Tussilago and Petasites. The classic Old World coltsfoot is T. far- fara, a European native that produces light yellow, dandelion-like flowers and leaves proportionately large and heart shaped. The Petasites genus, on the other hand, produces its flowers on a leafless stem before the leaves fully develop. Five species of Petasites inhabit North America, while T. farfara is strictly a naturalized import here. Both genera of coltsfoot are equally valuable as medi- cines. For the purposes of identifying varieties native to North America, we focus on the Petasites clan of coltsfoot. The flowers of Petasites are generally drab and featherlike, ranging in color from white to light purple, and are pre- sented in a cluster at the top of the plant. Leaves vary in shape according to species, from triangular (P. frigidus and P. nivalis) or narrowly arrow shaped (P. sag- itatta), to broadly oval shaped with deep palmate (resembling a hand with the fin- gers spread) lobes (P. palmatus). The 3- to 10-inch-wide leaves are presented on long leaf stems that extend directly from thick, creeping rootstocks and are dark green on their upper surfaces and lighter green and feltlike on their undersides. Habitat and Range: Coltsfoot requires consistent moisture at its feet and is usu- ally found along streams, in wet mead- ows, and on shaded road margins, par- ticularly where water seepage is contin- uous. Several species of Petasites range in forested areas from Alaska southward to California and eastward across the northern half of North America. The European variety of coltsfoot (T. farfara) has escaped cultivation in the northeast- ern portions of the U.S., where it enjoys similar habitat characteristics. Cycle and Bloom Season: Late March to early June Parts Used: Leaves and stems of the mature plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Expect- orant, eases cough spasms (antispasmod- ic), anti-inflammatory, antibacterial Strongest Affinities: Lungs and upper respiratory tract Preparation: Water infusion (tea), tinc- ture, or syrup Common Uses: People have been using coltsfoot for hundreds of years in the Petasites palmatus Herbs for Pets 86 treatment of respiratory ailments rang- ing from chest colds to whooping cough, asthma, and viral pneumonia. Coltsfoot has long been regarded as a first choice for relieving the rawness and pain of unproductive spasmodic coughs. It is soothing because of its mucilage, and the ingredient petasin acts as an antispasmodic and nerve sedative for the bronchial rings and pulmonary receptors in the lungs. Coltsfoot is useful in easing the dis- comforts of respiratory infections that are characterized by dry cough or seem- ingly immobile accumulations of thick phlegm in the bronchi. We find it partic- ularly useful for tracheobronchitis in dogs (specifically kennel cough), espe- cially when combined with anti-viral herbs such as licorice. Preparations of T. farfara have been shown to inhibit Bordetella pertussis, a bacterial compo- nent of the kennel cough malady, as well as various other strains of gram-negative bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus hauseri, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus vulgaris. All of this makes coltsfoot useful as a respiratory disinfec- tant, expectorant, and cough suppres- sant in a wide variety of different ani- mals—plus it acts in a holistic manner. Many forms of cough suppressants (including wild cherry bark) simply sup- press the body’s efforts to heal itself by acting upon the brain to block the body’s cough response mechanisms. Coltsfoot, on the other hand, gently assists the body in its efforts to clear invading microbes out of the upper res- piratory tract. Glycerin tinctures are the ideal form of administration of this herb. A good starting dosage for most ani- mals is 0.5–1.5 milliliters (or about 1⁄3 teaspoon) per 20 pounds of an ani- mal’s body weight, two to three times a day. Availability: Although coltsfoot is cur- rently under FDA scrutiny and will likely be labeled as “unsafe for internal use,” the tincture or dried herb remains wide- ly available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Coltsfoot (both Tussilago and Petasites) can be propagated in a garden if given ample shade and rich, consistently moist, slightly acidic soil. This winter-hardy plant does best in a cool climate. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For deep coughs and bronchial congestion, colts- foot may be combined with mullein, horehound, licorice, or elecampane. For respiratory infections that are believed to be bacterial or fungal in origin, coltsfoot can be boosted with echinacea, Oregon grape, bee balm, or thyme. For respira- tory viruses, licorice and echinacea are good adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Coltsfoot contains PAs. The PA content of coltsfoot is about one-third of that contained in com- frey (Symphytum spp.), and most of this compound is contained in the plant’s flowers, not the leaves and stems. What this means is that the PA content of colts- foot is really quite low. Nevertheless, it can cause harm if it is used in absence of com- mon sense. For more on pyrrolizidine alka- loids (PAs), see “Comfrey.” COMFREY Symphytum officinale Borage Family Appearance: Comfrey is a robust plant with coarsely textured, broadly lance- shaped leaves that may exceed a foot in length at the base of the plant and become progressively smaller toward the top of the plant. The leaves and hollow stalk of the plant are covered with bristly C Materia Medica 87 c hairs that tend to irritate human skin. The downy tubular flowers are presented among the small upper leaves in droop- ing clusters and are usually a shade of pink or purple but are sometimes white or pale yellow. Large plants may reach 3 or more feet in height and multiply vig- orously by continuous root division, sometimes forming their own sort of hedgelike clump. Symphytum upland- icum (Russian comfrey) may grow in excess of 6 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Over thirty-five species of Symphytum are in cultivation worldwide, most having originated from Europe and western Asia. In North America, common comfrey (S. officinale) and Russian comfrey (S. uplandicum) are the most common garden varieties. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from early spring to late fall Parts Used: All aboveground parts Primary Medicinal Activities: Heals wounds; anti-inflammatory; astringent; lubricates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; expectorant Strongest Affinities: Skin, digestive tract, respiratory tract Preparation: Water or oil infusion, poultice, salve, fomentation Common Uses: Where does one start with an herb that has had such a rich his- tory as a healing device? Comfrey tradi- tionally has been used for everything from mastitis in goats to cancer in humans. Virtual libraries of scientific research and anecdotal records have been compiled over the centuries to substantiate, deny, or otherwise argue comfrey’s value and safety as an herbal medicine. Most of what you may have heard about this plant extends to ani- mals (especially mammals), including toxicity issues, and almost everyone who has lived around horses, goats, sheep, llamas, and a comfrey patch knows how valuable this plant is. Comfrey is among the first herbs to consider in the topical treatment of burns, skin ulcerations, abrasions, lacera- tions, flea and other insect bites, or just about any other irritation. Likewise, a poultice, salve, or infusion of the leaves can be applied directly to bruises, frac- tures, sprains, and other closed-tissue injuries. Most of the healing effects are attributable to allantoin, a compound that has been shown in several studies to speed cell reproduction, both inside and outside of the body. In fact, many herbalists have found that comfrey works so well at speed-healing injuries that it Symphytum officinale Herbs for Pets 88 can actually seal bacteria into the site of an open wound. To prevent this from happening, a strong antibacterial herb such as Oregon grape, thyme, usnea, or Saint-John’s-wort should be added to any comfrey preparation that is intended for open wounds, especially burns. In addition to its cell-proliferation activity, comfrey’s mucilaginous nature provides a soothing, lubricating, and protective barrier to the skin and inflammations of the digestive tract. Comfrey also con- tains rosmarinic acid and several other compounds that have been shown to contribute anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and astringent qualities to its list of heal- ing attributes. For external treatment of closed injuries, skin ulcers, or mastitis, you can make a poultice or fomentation from the fresh or dried leaves and apply to the affected area. If you have access to fresh comfrey leaves, wrap a handful in a clean towel, then place the towel into a bowl of boiling water. Allow it to soak until the water just begins to turn green, then remove the towel and leaves and squeeze the excess water from the towel back into the bowl. After allowing the fomentation to cool slightly, apply the warm compress to the affected area. With horses and other large animals, this might require you to secure the com- press onto a swollen limb with a strip of gauze or a clean piece of fabric torn from some old clothing. Leave the compress on for as long as possible—preferably eight hours or more. The extra “comfrey tea” that you squeezed back into the bowl can be applied to the compress from time to time and allowed to soak through to where it is needed. In cases of mastitis or other ailments where a fixed compress is not practical, an ointment or salve is a better option. If neither of these preparations is available, try making a strong tea of the leaves (fresh leaves are always superior to dried) and rinsing the entire area with the lukewarm liquid sev- eral times per day. Internal use of comfrey has become a controversial issue and is strongly dis- couraged by the FDA, though millions of people have been using this herb safely and effectively in their animals (and themselves) for centuries. As is true for many other herbs, the safe use of com- frey is measured by moderation and common sense. For treatment of colitis, stomach ulcers, or just about any other inflamma- tion of the digestive tract, a handful of the fresh leaves or 2–3 ounces of the dried leaves can be fed directly to horses and other large herbivores on a daily basis for up to two weeks. For dogs and cats, 1⁄2–1 teaspoon of the dried herb for each pound of food fed should be of therapeutic benefit. Comfrey is traditionally used for bronchitis and other respiratory ail- ments that are relieved by its soothing anti-inflammatory nature. A cooled tea serves this purpose well. Administer 1 tablespoon per 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. In all cases of internal use, feeding of com- frey should be limited to occasional short-term therapies. By no means should comfrey be fed to an animal as a daily food supplement because the plant contains small cumulative amounts of potentially toxic PAs. For the same reason, highly concentrated preparations such as tinctures or strong decoctions should not be employed internally. Availability: Any nursery that carries herb plants has access to comfrey. The dried herb and various salves, ointments, and other preparations containing com- frey are available through health food retailers and herb stores. C Materia Medica 89 c Propagation and Harvest: Comfrey can be easily started from root cuttings. It grows in just about any soil and is hardy as far north as central Canada. The biggest plants, though, are found in rich, deep, moist soil with a pH level in the range of 6 to 7.5. Once established, comfrey needs little attention. In fact, its rambunctious growth will amaze you. We live in an area of Montana that has a scant one hundred-day growing season and winter temperatures that may plunge to –40°F, yet our comfrey (which grows from beneath the foundation of the house) can be divided into multiple new starts at least twice per year! Alternatives and Adjuncts: For exter- nal applications, comfrey combines espe- cially well with calendula, chamomile, aloe, Saint-John’s-wort, or bee balm. For gastric disorders, comfrey combines with cleavers, calendula, catnip, or chamomile. Cautions and Comments: The issues of toxicity that have haunted comfrey in recent years have become a major sub- ject of frustration for herbalists, a source of apprehension and political ammuni- tion for opponents of herbal medicine, and a wealth of misinformation, confu- sion, and fear for the casual herb user. While the FDA and other protective agencies are doing their jobs as best they can during a major health care revolu- tion—and it is not our intent to criticize them—most herbalists agree that com- frey has received an undeserved bad rep- utation. The FDA has banned the sale of comfrey for internal use, but in thou- sands of years of use by millions of peo- ple, only two reports of hepatotoxicity have been documented in humans. Indeed, comfrey contains PAs, which are known to cause liver damage or can- cer if ingested in large enough quanti- ties. Most of the concern surrounding these alkaloids, however, comes from studies or cases where the alkaloids were isolated from the rest of the plant’s chem- istry and then fed or injected into test ani- mals in quantities or concentrations hun- dreds of times greater than those that would occur in nature. Common sense dictates that anything ingested in over- abundance is potentially toxic, but given the fact that the PA content in a fresh comfrey leaf amounts to only about 0.3 percent of its total chemistry, the average horse would need to eat several hundred pounds of the leaves each day before any toxic effects would be observed! Coffee contains over one dozen potentially toxic alkaloids—so does chocolate. However, the real threat from PAs comes from the fact that these alkaloids may accumulate in the body, perhaps to toxic levels, if used continually over a long period. Therefore, if you plan to use comfrey or any other herb that contains PAs in an internal application, do so with modera- tion and only for short periods. Don’t use comfrey in pregnant or lactating animals or in animals with preexisting liver disease. Also, keep in mind that the PA content of the root is ten times greater than that of the fresh leaves; therefore, the root shouldn’t be used internally. On the other hand, the PA content of the dried leaves, the form in which comfrey is most readily available in the marketplace, is practically nil. CORN SILK Zea mays Grass Family Appearance: We’re sorry if you were expecting something other than the obvious here, but the corn silk we’re referring to is simply the hairlike pollen- receiving portion of a corn stalk, the part most of us throw away first when we peel an ear of corn. Herbs for Pets 90 Habitat and Range: Farms and gar- dens throughout the world Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms in early summer. The “silk” develops just as the plant is beginning to form cobs. Parts Used: Silk Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic; lubricates, soothes, and protects inter- nal mucous membranes; anti-inflamma- tory, stimulates the liver (cholagogue), astringent Strongest Affinities: Genitourinary tract, including the kidneys Preparation: A low-alcohol (less than 25 percent alcohol) tincture or an infu- sion (tea) of the fresh silk is preferable. The dried silk may be used if it is fresh, but it is not as potent as silk that has been recently pulled from the plant. Common Uses: First and foremost, corn silk is indicated wherever chronic inflammation exists in any portion of the urinary tract or kidneys. It is specifi- cally indicated in FLUTD, where it serves to reduce inflammation without caus- ing added irritation to the kidneys. Unlike many other diuretic and astrin- gent herbs used to increase urine out- put by means of kidney irritation, corn silk does not contain harsh volatile oils that may compound the problems of inflammatory kidney disease. Therefore, it is useful for improving kidney func- tion during early onset kidney failure or for helping with the reduction of pain and inflammation in the passing of kidney or bladder stones (especially when combined with marshmallow). The astringency factor of corn silk is enough to tighten and strengthen the lining of the bladder and the smooth- muscle tissues of the urinary tract, mak- ing the herb useful in some cases of chronic urinary incontinence, but it is not strong enough to effectively stop acute cases of bleeding or inflamma- tion. So, corn silk is best remembered as a long-term medicine for chronic uri- nary problems. Corn silk has been shown to lower blood pressure and blood sugar levels and to possess chola- gogue and diuretic activities in labora- tory animals. All of these activities serve as clues as to why corn silk is especially effective as a general kidney tonic. The effectiveness of fresh silk over dried cannot be overstated, and the best meth- ods of administration involve the direct feeding of the herb in a low-alcohol liquid base (a strong tea is ideal). Dosage is diffi- cult to generalize because of the variable nature of genitourinary diseases. But a safe starting point is to use 1 milliliter (about 30 drops or so, or 1⁄4 teaspoon) of the low- alcohol tincture per 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. If the tinc- ture is alcohol-free, it can be administered directly into the mouth. If not, it should be no more than 25 percent alcohol and should then be further diluted with at least an equal amount of water. To make a tea of the fresh silk, chop it as finely as possible, then steep a heaping tablespoon of the herb in near-boiling water until the mixture cools. After the tea is strained, it can be fed to the animal—1⁄4 cup (if possible) per 20 pounds of body weight, twice daily. Many herbivores enjoy eating corn silk. This is fine, but remember that if you want to get an optimum amount of the herb into your animal’s uri- nary tract, it really needs to be adminis- tered as a liquid. Availability: Finding dried corn silk is easy and several manufacturer’s pro- vide extracts of this herb, but if you C Materia Medica 91 c want fresh corn silk, you might have to plant some corn in your herb garden. If you have access to organically raised fresh corn at your local health food store, you can use the silk from this. However, nonorganic sources of corn silk should be avoided because the silk has likely been sprayed with a pesti- cide. Corn silk should look fresh, juicy, and colorful. If it has turned brown, much of its medicinal activity has diminished. Propagation and Harvest: Corn is easy to grow, and dozens of varieties are available to suit virtually any set of growing conditions. (We live at an ele- vation of 5,500 feet in Montana, and even we can grow corn.) Harvest your corn before the silk turns brown—usual- ly in early summer. If you want to eat the corn, make sure that it has an opportunity to receive pollen from the tassels of the plants for at least a week before you harvest, otherwise your cobs will have no kernels. Plan to use your fresh silk immediately. Cooled corn silk tea can be stored in the refrigerator for about a week—a glycerin tincture keeps for at least a year if kept refrigerated. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For chronic urinary tract inflammation, corn silk combines well with couch grass, calendula, or cleavers. If infec- tion is evident, add echinacea, Oregon grape, yarrow, or thyme. For urinary incontinence, read about Saint-John’s- wort, ginkgo, and uva ursi. To help pass kidney stones, try a half-and-half combination of corn silk and marsh- mallow. For use as a kidney tonic, corn silk combines with marshmallow, hawthorn, ginkgo, or goldenrod. For use in FLUTD, corn silk combines with couch grass, echinacea, marshmallow, and horsetail. Cautions and Comments: Corn silk is known to be safe, but this herb is actu- ally the pollen-receiving part of the plant. It stands to reason that animals with pollen allergies may have adverse reactions to corn silk. Corn silk has been shown to stimulate uterine con- tractions in rabbits and therefore should be used with caution (if at all) in pregnant animals. COUCH GRASS Agropyron repens Grass Family Appearance: If you are a gardener, you probably already know, and hate, this plant by the name quack grass. Couch grass (pronounced “cooch grass” in much of Europe, its native birthplace and medic- inal origin) is a profusely common weed in North America. To the untrained eye, Agropyron repens looks like every other Zea mays Herbs for Pets 92 waist-high wild grass—with perhaps the most distinctive exception displayed by its leaves. Each leaf, or blade, of couch grass looks as though somebody pinched a crimp in it 1 or 2 inches away from the tip. While this does not serve as a definitive means of identification, it provides a good point from which you can begin the process of ruling out look-alike grasses in your area, one species at a time. If you wish to gather this plant for medicinal use, find some samples of what you think might be couch grass, and then take them to your county extension agent, a botanist, or somebody else who can iden- tify grasses. Unless you are experienced at using a botanical key (a scientific reference used to identify plants through recogni- tion of their taxonomic features), identify- ing couch grass is hit or miss. Fortunately, the look-alike grasses are not toxic—but they’re probably not medicinal. Habitat and Range: Couch grass is native to the Mediterranean area. It now makes itself at home virtually everywhere on earth. In North America, expect to find it in areas where livestock grazing, farming, or other human-related activi- ties have delivered the seeds. Cycle and Bloom Season: An aggres- sive perennial that reproduces by seed or spreading rhizomes (horizontally creep- ing roots) Parts Used: Rhizomes Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, astringent, anti-inflammatory, mild diuretic Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract Preparation: Tincture or decoction of the fresh or freshly dried rhizomes. Use fresh leaves as a dietary supplement. Common Uses: Historically, many ani- mal lovers have come to know A. repens as dog grass because dogs, cats, and other animals love eating the fresh spring leaves of the plant. Our dogs are no exception—we have clumps of dog grass growing in front of our house, and whenever an opportunity arises (one that doesn’t interfere with a game of Frisbee), our dogs both actively graze on the plants. It’s interesting to watch how they actually differentiate the couch grass from other grasses in their intuitive drive to eat the plants. But even more interesting is the way our dogs instinc- tively use this plant to fulfill special health care needs. Specifically, they eat couch grass to the point of vomiting, and while humans may find this some- what disgusting, an inquisitive herbalist with a holistically oriented mind can clearly see what the animals are doing. They are either using the grass as a digestive cleansing agent or they are vomiting so they can reingest their stom- ach contents. The latter may be indica- tive of poor nutrient absorption—eating food twice, in effect, allows for more complete absorption of certain nutrients. The point is this: if your animal eats grass, the grass is likely to fill a nutrition- al or medicinal need, and such activities should not be overlooked when assess- ing your animal’s holistic health—even if you do wish to look away and forget about it. As a food, a patch of couch grass pro- vides grazing animals with a rich source of vitamins A and B, iron, rough fiber, and silica (for healthy bones, hooves, nails, and coat). But most of the medici- nal value of couch grass is contained within the rhizomes of the plant. Couch grass serves as an excellent tonic and disinfectant for the urinary tract. It is a soothing, anti-inflammatory demulcent and saponin-based diuretic C Materia Medica 93 c with mild antimicrobial activity. Couch grass is considered a specific remedy for chronic or acute cases of cystitis and ure- thritis, where the root tea or tincture helps to reduce inflammation, inhibit bacterial reproduction, and lessen pain during urination. It should be noted that although couch grass has been shown to possess broad antibiotic activity, it may be too weak to be effective against infec- tions that are already well established. In such cases, couch grass should be com- bined with stronger antimicrobial herbs such as echinacea, thyme, or Oregon grape (or certified organic goldenseal— don’t buy wildcrafted goldenseal because the plant is at risk of becoming extinct). As a diuretic, couch grass increases the volume of urine by stimulating sodi- um excretion, helping to wash away waste materials from the body via the kidneys. This makes couch grass an effec- tive adjunct to a variety of liver- supporting, alterative herbs (such as dandelion or burdock), especially in the treatment of rheumatism or chronic skin problems. The demulcent properties of couch grass soothe inflammation, so it can also be used for kidney stones and gravel. And because couch grass is gentle on the kidneys and seldom irritates the bladder or urethra during long-term use, it is a primary herb to consider when treating the symptoms of FLUTD in cats, a condi- tion that is usually due to factors other than infection. For use in urinary problems, the best way to administer this herb is in the form of a cooled decoction. Make the decoction by gently simmering a heap- ing teaspoon of the chopped dried root, or 2 heaping teaspoons of the chopped fresh root (rhizomes), in 8 ounces of water for about twenty min- utes. The decoction can be squirted directly into the animal’s mouth. A safe starting dose is about a 1⁄2 teaspoon (2–3 milliliters) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, two to three times daily. If direct administration is too difficult, the dose can be added to the animal’s drinking water. Try to figure out how much your animal drinks, then add enough couch grass to meet dosing requirements. Glycerin or alcohol tinc- tures can be used at half the above dosage and are best if diluted into water. Keep in mind that this is a subtle herbal medicine—the needs and sys- temic requirements of the animal you are helping may require several increas- es in dosage over several days or weeks of administration. Availability: Couch grass is not a pop- ular herb in the U.S. (although it is pop- ular in Europe), and some of the dried Agropyron repens Herbs for Pets 94 rhizomes that you find in herb stores are on the verge of becoming useless dust. Fortunately, it grows everywhere. The only problem is identifying it among other weeds and finding the physical stamina to dig up the stubborn rhi- zomes. If you meet these criteria, you can easily become a garden hero in your neighborhood. (On the other hand, everyone may think you’re nuts for actu- ally wanting the weed.) The golden rule: Beware of pesticides. Finding “clean” couch grass is often difficult. Propagation and Harvest: As far as propagating couch grass is concerned, go ahead if you don’t mind sacrificing the engine on your tiller and if you don’t care if the plant strangles the rest of your garden. The rhizomes can be harvested anytime throughout the growth season but are usually strongest when dug up in the fall. The best medicines are made from the fresh rhizomes, but dried roots are useful, too, if used within a year of digging. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For urinary inflammations that are secondary to infec- tion, combine with Oregon grape, organi- cally raised goldenseal, thyme, or echi- nacea. For stones or any other cause of uri- nary tract inflammation, marshmallow, corn silk, and plantain are valuable adjuncts. If blood is present in the urine, see your holistic veterinarian—your pet needs stronger measures than couch grass. Cautions and Comments: No toxicity has been noted for couch grass, although excessive amounts may lead to vomiting or diarrhea. Always be careful about veri- fying the cleanliness of the sources of this herb—it is on just about everybody’s “noxious weed” list, and pesticide residues can remain with the plant for sev- eral years. DANDELION Taraxacum officinale Sunflower Family Appearance: It’s time for all good herbalists to put their egos aside. Dandelion is actually confused with several other species of the sunflower family, and although we may hate to admit it, many of us have been fooled into using one of the look-alikes. The primary consideration to bear in mind when identifying Taraxacum officinale or any of its hundreds of variations is this: Dandelion has no branching char- acteristics but instead grows in a rosette fashion directly off of its tap- root. And dandelion never has spines on its midrib as does Lactuca serriola (prickly lettuce), which otherwise looks similar to dandelion when young. Although dandelion impostors likely won’t harm you, they won’t offer you dandelion’s benefits, either. Habitat and Range: A native of Europe and Asia, dandelion has found its way onto every continent—except maybe Antarctica. Cycle and Bloom Season: Dandelion is a perennial that may bloom several times throughout the year. In areas where there is severe winter climate, dandelion may appear only as a free- seeding annual. Parts Used: All parts of the plant are useful for various applications. Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic, stimulates the liver, stimulates salivation and improves digestion (bitter), nutritive, laxative, anti-inflammatory, tonic Strongest Affinities: Liver, gallblad- der, gastrointestinal tract D Materia Medica 95 d Preparation: Water infusion, decoc- tion, tincture, fresh or dried leaves and flowers Common Uses: To begin an accurate assessment of dandelion’s deep-reaching medicinal attributes, we must first put healing into a whole-body perspective. All higher organisms (including dogs, cats, birds, mice, lizards, goats, and humans) maintain vital body functions within tightly knit parameters of sys- temic cooperation. A precise and bal- anced relationship between nutrition and elimination of waste is a critical part of this cooperation. If a systemic excess or deficiency occurs that the body can- not correct through elimination, supple- mentation, or immune system interven- tion, it will try to compensate by shut- ting down a system or storing waste materials wherever it can. In other words, a state of “dis-ease” results. Enter the dandelion. Dandelion is one of the most com- plete plant foods on earth. A 1-cup serv- ing of fresh dandelion greens provides as much as 2,000 international units (IU) of vitamin A (one and a half times the rec- ommended daily allowance [RDA] for an adult human); 20 percent protein (by content, that’s double what spinach pro- vides); vitamins C, K, D, and B complex; iron, manganese, phosphorus, and many other trace minerals; and an especially rich supply of potassium. All of these vital nutrients are conveniently contained within a single source in quantities that the body can fully absorb. This means that dandelion can gently supplement a diet without overworking the liver and kidneys with excess vitamins and minerals (which is often signified by dark urine). Supplementing your companion ani- mal’s diet with dandelion leaf is as sim- ple as drying the greens and crumbling them onto her food. If your animal doesn’t like eating dandelion or if you need to get nutrients into her more quickly, try making a leaf tea using organic unsalted vegetable or meat broth in place of plain water. Plan on feeding about 1 teaspoon of the dried herb for each 20 pounds of body weight daily. Horses, llamas, sheep, goats, mules, and other large animals often eat the greens directly out of their pastures. If they don’t, try hand feeding the greens to them or adding a little molasses. If your animal is sensitive to changes in diet, then start her off with a small amount of dandelion at a time. In addition to providing your animal with many of the nutrients she needs, the leaves have what herbalists call a bit- ter tonic effect: the body’s metabolism is “warmed up” before the digestive sys- tem is forced to go to work. When a Taraxacum officinale Herbs for Pets 96 small amount of a bitter herb is taken into the mouth, the recipient immediate- ly experiences a sudden increase in sali- vation. As the bitter herb reaches the stomach, bile and other digestive agents are then triggered into production. The result is more efficient digestion, reduced indigestion, better absorption of nutrients, and increased appetite. Dandelion leaf is particularly useful in animals who have a chronic problem with indigestion. If your animal has fre- quent gas or passes food that does not appear digested, get her to chew a fresh dandelion leaf while you reconsider her diet, or apply a few drops of dandelion tincture (an herbal glycerite is most palatable) onto her tongue. It does not matter if the animal doesn’t appear to swallow it; the bitter tonic action is trig- gered in the mouth. Dandelion is well known among herbalists as a safe but powerful diuretic and liver stimulant. Congestive heart fail- ure, pulmonary edema, arthritis, gallblad- der disease, and kidney stones are all imbalances resulting from the body’s inability to eliminate water or accumulat- ed excesses. In mainstream practices, drugs such as furosemide are often used to drain off excess fluid from the body and thus promote the elimination of accumulated waste materials. Pharma- ceutical diuretics are fast acting, easy to administer, and effective, but while they do a great job at expelling fluid, they tend not to discriminate between what the body needs to keep and what it needs to lose. As a result, the body often loses too much potassium, a crucial heart and brain nutrient, through urination. In this event, potassium must be supplemented throughout the therapy. Dandelion leaf, on the other hand, contains its own rich source of fully assimilable potassium, an attribute that helps to replace what would otherwise be lost through urination. How effective is dandelion as a diuret- ic? Many contemporary herbalists claim that dandelion may be as effective as the aforementioned furosemide. The big trade-offs, though, are ease of adminis- tration, getting enough of the tea into the animal to bring about desired effects, and the time that it may take for dandelion to start working. While furosemide can be administered in a lit- tle pill, a dandelion therapy involves get- ting your animal to drink warm tea or take a tincture extract (the broth method works nicely). None of this is meant to encourage you to stop the diuretic ther- apy prescribed by your veterinarian. If you wish to seek the dandelion alterna- tive, see a holistic veterinarian first. While dandelion leaves are nutritive and diuretic, the root possesses its own usefulness as a safe, reliable liver tonic. The liver is the primary filtering organ of the body; it is responsible for removing toxins and excesses from the blood for elimination via the kidneys. The liver also plays critical roles in digestion through its production of bile, bilirubin, and vari- ous enzymes. If bile ducts in the liver or gallbladder become congested, blocked, or otherwise diseased to the point of dysfunction, the body invariably suffers one or more toxicity-related imbalances. Such imbalances may be characterized by symptoms such as jaundice, rheuma- toid conditions, eczema, dandruff, or chronic constipation. And while dande- lion leaf tea or tincture may do much toward relieving the symptoms of such conditions through a nutritive and diuretic action, the root will have more effect on the underlying causes. Dandelion root has a well-validated ability to stimulate bile production and circulation throughout the liver. In one study involving dogs, researchers observed a three to four times increase in bile production after administration of D Materia Medica 97 d dandelion root. The gallbladder, which stores bile from the liver, is also stimulat- ed, causing this small, hollow organ to contract and release bile into the diges- tive tract, thus aiding in digestion and acting as a gentle laxative to promote the elimination of solid waste. One of the best features about dande- lion root as a liver and gallbladder stimu- lant is its gentle nature. Unlike many chol- agogue herbs, dandelion does not further irritate an already inflamed condition. In fact, in clinical studies using an over-the- counter preparation of the root, dandelion was shown to be effective in treating inflammatory diseases of the liver and gall- bladder, including gallstones. The flowers of dandelion are known by herbalists to be high in lecithin and to have weak but useful analgesic qualities. Their usefulness as a pain reliever stems from the fact that they don’t contain any salicylates, the alkaloid compounds found in aspirin that are toxic to cats and may be irritating to the stomach lining. To use the flowers, infuse a generous handful in a cup of near-boiling water. When the water has darkened as much as possible, it can be cooled and administered with a dropper: 30–40 drops per 20 pounds of body weight. If this proves to be too difficult for you and your animal, try drying the flow- ers and sprinkling them on her food. You shouldn’t expect aspirin-like effectiveness, but this is a mild painkilling option worth considering. Dandelion is perhaps the first herb to consider when optimized digestion and waste elimination is a necessary part of an herbal therapy. In holistic healing, the body, whether it be human or another kind of animal, should not be viewed as a collection of individual body systems but as an intricately balanced coopera- tion of relative components. From this perspective, it is easy to see how dande- lion can serve a positive role in its effort to help the body at what it is designed to do—stay healthy. The body cannot achieve this goal unless it is able to effec- tively utilize nutrients and eliminate waste—and dandelion is here to help. Availability: Everywhere! Propagation and Harvest: If you wish to propagate dandelion (no, we’re not insane), give the plants deep humus-rich soil and full sun. Gather dandelion greens for use in salads in early spring— they get bitter with age. Leaves intended for herbal teas and medicines can be gathered anytime in dry weather. Wet dandelion leaves tend to develop mold while they are drying, so don’t wash them after picking. Shake them off and dry them on newspapers in a well-venti- lated area, away from light. Then stir them often to prevent molding and store them in plastic bags only after they are completely crispy dry. Gather the roots as late in fall as possible; this is when they contain the greatest concen- tration of beneficial constituents. Chop them up (we use a food processor), then spread them onto newspaper and dry with the same consideration you gave to the leaves. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For liver and digestive problems, consider milk thistle, burdock, yellow dock, marshmal- low, chickweed, and Oregon grape as possible adjuncts or alternatives. Cautions and Comments: The first and foremost consideration in using dan- delion as food or medicine is the cleanli- ness of the plants you are using. Always make sure that the greens you are feed- ing have never been sprayed with herbi- cide. If they ever have, don’t try washing them. Move on to another patch. You won’t have trouble finding more. Herbs for Pets 98 DILL Anethum graveolens Parsley Family Appearance: A healthy dill plant is an attractive addition to any herb garden. Plants may reach 6 feet in height. The dark green finely divided leaves have a delicate feathery appearance, and the yellow umbel (umbrella-like) flowers are attrac- tive to bees. The entire plant is distinctive- ly aromatic and delicious—just brushing past one can make your mouth water! Habitat and Range: Originally a native of southeast Europe and southwest Asia, dill is a common resident in herb gar- dens worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms in early to midsummer, dill is successful at reproducing from the copious quantities of viable seed it pro- duces shortly after blooming. Parts Used: Foliage, flowers, and seeds Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, soothes the stomach (stomachic), stimulates milk production, antibacterial, diuretic Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract Preparation: Feeding of the fresh or dried herb, tea, tincture, poultice Common Uses: Dill is good for relieving nausea and flatulence, especially when these maladies are secondary to a sudden change in diet—such as when your puppy decides to steal a tamale from your foolishly unattended dinner plate. The effectiveness of dill in this capacity is largely attributable to the plant’s numer- ous volatile oil constituents, which com- bine to cause an antifoaming action in the stomach, like many over-the-counter anti- gas remedies. The highest concentrations of these oils are held within the seeds of the plant, but the dried leaves and stems (the herb you likely have in the kitchen) can be used too. If your dog is belching something that is suspiciously reminiscent of what was supposed to be your dinner and the problem appears to be getting progressively worse, try direct-feeding 2–8 ounces of cooled dill seed tea (1 tea- spoon of dill seed to 8 ounces of water) to the animal. If your animal doesn’t like the flavor, try adding the tea to her drinking water—or, if need be, disguise it as “yummy people food” by making the tea with some clear, unsalted broth instead of water. If belching, bloating, or other forms of indigestion are a problem after every feeding, call a holistic veterinarian and reassess your animal’s diet. Think holistically—a sprinkling of ground dill seed on your pet’s food may bring about symptomatic relief, but if the condition is ongoing, a deeper problem needs to be addressed. In addition to providing relief from excess gas, dill also possesses antibac- terial qualities that are strong enough to inhibit bacterial reproduction in the mouth but too weak to compromise beneficial microbes deeper in the diges- tive tract. This makes dill useful for treating halitosis and the early onset of gingivitis in dogs and cats. The herb or seeds can be infused and added to drinking water, or a poultice or glycerin tincture can be swabbed on the ani- mal’s gum line two or three times daily. Dill is useful for treating mild to moderate cases of colic. If they will take it, horses and other large herbivores can be fed the seeds or even the entire fresh plant—as much as they need. Dill seed contains carvone, anetho- furan, and limonene, volatile oils that have been shown to increase the pro- D Materia Medica 99 E duction of cancer-fighting enzymes (namely, glutathione s-transferase, or GST) in the body. These enzymes react with certain types of carcinogenic chemicals, eliminating them from the system. While this in itself represents only a small measure of cancer preven- tion, it makes dill another medicinal food to consider when custom-tailoring your animal’s diet plan. While dill con- tains limonene, a substance known to repel fleas, its presence is not large enough to be of use by itself. The carvone that dill contains, how- ever, is believed to increase the effective- ness of various other natural insecticides (such as those contained in feverfew or oxeye daisy), making dill a useful adjunct in the never-ending battle against fleas. Dill has a folkloric reputation as a sub- stance that stimulates the production of milk in nursing mothers. Availability: The grocery store or your favorite nursery Propagation and Harvest: Dill is easy to grow from seed or starts and can be seeded in fall for an early spring harvest in areas where winters are harsh. In areas where the growing season is long but not too hot, a continuous self-seeding crop of dill is not only possible but per- haps inevitable. Harvest the leaves and flowers when they are lush and aromat- ic, the seeds shortly after they have turned brown, before they begin to fall to the ground. This is best accomplished by clipping off the entire umbel, then shaking the seeds into a paper bag. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For gas and other digestive problems, dill com- bines with fennel, parsley seed, or cat- nip. For infections of the mouth, Oregon grape, sage, and thyme are stronger options. For bad breath, a combination of parsley, dill, and peppermint makes an excellent formula. For fleas, try making a skin and coat rinse by combining dill, feverfew flowers, and yarrow into a tea. Cautions and Comments: Dill is safe but because of its volatile oil con- stituents, dill should be used conserva- tively in pregnant or lactating animals. ECHINACEA Echinacea spp. Sunflower Family Appearance: Echinacea, also known as purple, pink, or white coneflower, is a taprooted perennial that may grow as high as 40 inches. Nine species of Echinacea are native to North America; all have flowers with distinctive conelike central disks, with the most common species ranging in color from pale to dark purple. The rays of most species Anethum graveolens Herbs for Pets 100 droop away from the disk when mature. Echinacea purpurea (see photo) is by far the most widely distributed species in North America. For several decades, this species has been popular as a medicinal herb and garden flower. Dozens of vari- eties of E. purpurea have been devel- oped, and it is estimated that the entire world market supply of this species comes from cultivated plants. Several other species, however, such as E. angus- tifolia and E. pallida are quickly succumb- ing to commercial and environmental pressures. Habitat and Range: In the West, echi- nacea is largely an introduced plant. Partial to open plains and woodlands, its natural range once extended from east- ern Canada southward into the Ozarks and westward throughout the corn belt states to the east slopes of the Rockies. Market pressures and continuing loss of habitat have eliminated most of the wild stands of echinacea. Its range continues to shrink, and today only small isolated populations of wild echinacea survive west of the Missouri River. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in early to late summer, depending on climate Parts Used: Most often the root is used. The leaves, stems, and flowers are useful too, although they are much weaker medicine. Primary Medicinal Activities: Immuno- stimulant, antimicrobial Strongest Affinities: Immune system, lymph system, urinary tract Preparation: Tincture, decoction, dried and powdered root, or direct feeding of the fresh leaves, stems, and flowers Common Uses: First and foremost, echinacea is an immune-supporting herb—it serves to support intact immune functions through stimulatory and strengthening actions at various levels within the body. No single constituent contained in the root or flowering upper parts of echinacea can be attributed to the immune-tonifying functions of this plant. Instead, most herbalists agree that the complex structure of this plant should be viewed as a therapeutic syner- gy of dozens of biochemical influences. However, a few key elements stand out as strong clues to exactly how echinacea works. A great deal of scientific research has identified echinacea’s most influential immunostimulatory components as an extensive array of caffeic acids, volatile oils, polysaccharides, polyenes, polyines, and isobutylamides. In simpler terms, echinacea’s immunostimulatory qualities are derived from a wide array of chemical compounds that allow the plant to be used in a variety of forms without sacrificing its effectiveness. For instance, while many of the acid con- stituents in echinacea are poorly water soluble and require a strong alcohol base to extract them into a tincture form, the plant’s polysaccharide con- stituents are exactly the opposite—they are easily extracted into water—and, in fact, they are largely destroyed by alco- hol. Since both of these chemical groups have been shown to possess very strong immunostimulatory quali- ties, it would appear that the plant is naturally designed to accommodate a wide variety of metabolic needs. Echinacea serves to support disease resistance in several ways. At the blood level, it accelerates phagocytosis, the means by which macrophages and other antibodies attack and remove bacteria. At cellular levels, echinacea helps to E Materia Medica 101 e reduce the production of an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, the com- pound that occurs between cells to bind them together. Eliminating this enzyme at the onset of an infection is believed to make body tissues less pervious to invad- ing microbes and, in turn, the invaders more vulnerable to scavenging antibod- ies that have already been stimulated into action. Echinacea has also been shown to stimulate the lymph system, thus helping the body to eliminate waste materials from the tissues. And it pos- sesses measurable antimicrobial qualities that assist the body’s fight against infec- tion by intervening with bacteria at the point of invasion. Echinacea’s multidirectional means of immune system support, its primary usefulness, depends on a healthy immune system. Without a healthy pop- ulation of unencumbered antibodies to work with, echinacea’s capacity to fight infection is limited to its simple, and less-than-impressive, antiseptic actions. This means that timing is critical to echi- nacea’s effectiveness—this herb should be taken at the first onset of infectious symptoms, otherwise its activity will amount to a losing battle fought against microbial opponents that have already fortified their positions within the ani- mal’s body. Learn to recognize minute variances in your animal’s behavior and feeding habits. Take extra time to give your pet a cursory examination during your daily grooming session or playtimes, and look for anything that may point to the intro- duction of an infection—an inflamed gum, a swollen fleabite, or a slightly runny nose may be indicators for the proactive use of echinacea. If you are too late and an infection has set in, it’s time to consider calling in some other troops from the herbal army. Don’t despair. Try boosting echinacea with a small percent- age of an antiseptic herb such as Oregon grape, usnea, or organically grown gold- enseal. By combining echinacea with about 10 percent by weight or volume of one of these other herbs, you will be offering a small measure of direct antiseptic intervention without compro- mising populations of the beneficial microbes the body needs in its fight. Applying antiseptics topically, directly onto the point of infection, also aids in the healing effort. So how much echinacea should you give, for how long, and in what form? Many people think that the potency of an echinacea preparation can be deter- mined by the intensity of the tingling sensation it causes when placed on the tongue. If this is your current method of judging echinacea preparations, please abandon it. A great deal of recent and continuing research has shown that the isobutylamides responsible for this sen- sation represent only a fragment of echi- nacea’s active constituents and that their absence may not affect the overall effectiveness of echinacea. The more we learn about echinacea, the more com- plex and diverse its medicinal actions seem to be. There is no best kind of echinacea preparation per se. As long as care and quality have gone into its propagation, its harvest, and the manufacture of the end product, all echinacea preparations contain adequate medicinal constituents. The question of what preparation to use internally in your animal hinges on how easy or difficult it is to get a therapeutic quantity into the animal. Echinacea is by no means a good-tasting herb, and its administration is complicated by the fact that dogs and cats have short digestive tracks and fast metabolic rates. In these animals, the problem isn’t finding a preparation that contains high enough concentrations of active constituents but Herbs for Pets 102 finding one that is both palatable and fully assimilable by their short digestive tracts. Cats in particular don’t like alco- hol and the sour tingle that alcohol extracts impart on the tongue. (They typically foam at the mouth and some- times act as if you are force-feeding them a vile, poisonous fluid.) Dogs typically drink from toilets without complaint and are somewhat less picky, and since gel capsules often pass directly through them undigested, we prefer to use low- alcohol glycerin extracts for our carni- vores. Glycerin-based preparations are low in tongue-tingling isobutylamides but rich in readily available polysaccha- ride constituents, and the sweet taste of the vegetable glycerin helps mask the unpleasant flavor of the herb. Herbivores are naturally designed to efficiently metabolize plant materials; horses, goats, llamas, and other large animals can be fed the flowering plants, or dried root can be added to their feed. Dosage and duration of use vary based upon the needs and individual nuances of the animal, but a conserva- tive rule for dogs and cats is to give 12–25 drops of the tincture three times daily. Horses, cattle, sheep, and other large animals can be fed a couple of handfuls of the dried whole flowering herb per day. Several high-quality pow- dered echinacea preparations are now available for equines and other large animals as well. Use them as directed by your veterinarian or as suggested on the label. In recent years, a rather heated con- troversy has arisen within the herbalist community concerning how long echi- nacea can be used before the body builds a tolerance to its immune-stimu- lating actions. In a German study con- ducted in 1989, a diminished response to echinacea was recorded in human subjects after five to ten days of normal dose administration. This result raised questions of whether echinacea is effec- tive when used over the long term. Closer scrutiny of this study, however, has since led to the conclusion that while echinacea’s activity does fall off sharply after about five days of use, its long-term use still maintains a level of immune sys- tem activity higher than that observed prior to its initial administration. Many herbalists believe that breaking the con- tinuity of echinacea use every five to ten days allows for a greater immune boost each time the therapy is reestablished after a two- or three-day respite. We agree and believe that a break is neces- sary, in any case, to monitor the unassist- ed recovery of the animal. Five days on, two or three days off is a good guideline to follow. Aside from its immune-stimulating qualities, echinacea is a good antimicro- bial for the mouth and urinary tract. It is useful for treating bacterial or fungal infections of the bladder and urethra, especially when added to a demulcent and anti-inflammatory combination of herbs. Echinacea also has a long-stand- ing reputation as a snakebite remedy. Used internally and externally simultane- ously, the herb is said to antidote the venom. Although little scientific evi- dence exists to support such claims, hun- dreds of years’ worth of use amounts to more than folkloric trivia. Knowing that about 85 percent of rattlesnake bites involve only a partial injection of venom (or no injection at all), it is likely that echinacea serves more to ward off infec- tion and prevent tissue damage than to actually nullify the venom. Echinacea relieves the pain and swelling of most insect bites and stings, especially when applied as a clay poultice. Echinacea is also used with some suc- cess for colic in horses, with free-feeding of the fresh leaves, stems, and flowers E Materia Medica 103 e being the most popular method of administration. Availability: Various preparations of echinacea are widely available through health product retailers. The seeds and plants are available through most nurs- eries. Because of continuing overharvest, wild stands of this plant are at risk of dis- appearing forever. Please make sure that the echinacea you are using is from cul- tivated sources. Propagation and Harvest: Echinacea purpurea, the primary echinacea of com- merce, is easy to grow and requires little care once the plants are established. Seeds require cold, damp stratification and light to break their dormancy. This means that the seeds must be sown on top of the soil or covered with just a trace of soil in order to germinate. Roots must be at least three years old to be of medicinal value. The plants are hardy and drought tolerant when mature. A well-established stand of echinacea reseeds itself, and mature plants can bear roots of up to 3 pounds each. Varieties such as E. pallida and E. angustifolia are much more finicky. Before you choose to grow them, bear in mind that despite what herbalists once thought, the gardener-friendly E. pur- purea provides medicine that is as potent as these other species. Dig mature echinacea roots from the garden after the plant has gone dormant for the winter, following its third year of growth. The roots can be chopped and tinctured while fresh or dried and ground for use in teas. The dried roots can be tinctured as well. Leaves, stems, and flowers can be selectively harvested when they are in full bloom in midsummer. If you opt to do this, bear in mind that a preponder- ance of leaves and flowers must remain on the plants to provide life support for the roots and to produce viable seeds. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Virtually any of the alterative, diuretic, chola- gogue, or expectorant herbs combine well with echinacea to support the body during microbial infections. To help fight infections of the mouth, digestive tract, or urinary tract, echinacea serves as an excellent adjunct to Oregon grape or couch grass. As a lymphatic, echinacea combines well with cleavers. Cautions and Comments: Echinacea is a very safe herb. But remember, echi- nacea can only be expected to support a healthy immune system. If the animal is malnourished or immune-compro- mised by preexisting disease or by other factors, you should consider dietary changes and/or other measures that feed and support the immune Echinacea purpurea Herbs for Pets 104 system before jumping into Echinacea therapy. Before using echinacea, it is a good idea to consult a holistic veterinar- ian—especially if you are uncertain of your animal’s level of disease resistance. ELECAMPANE Inula helenium Sunflower Family Appearance: Elecampane is a stout, impressive plant. Healthy specimens may grow in excess of 6 feet high. We have seen these plants in tightly clustered hedgelike stands so thick that one can- not see daylight through them. The nar- rowly lance-shaped leaves may exceed 16 inches in length and 4 inches in width. The daisylike flowers may reach 4 inches in diameter, are burnt orange, and have narrow rays that contrast with the robust overall appearance of the plant—a splendid addition to any herb or flower garden! Habitat and Range: Probably a native of southeastern Europe, elecampane has become naturalized throughout much of Europe and the eastern portions of the U.S. It has been cultivated throughout much of the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that generally blooms in early to mid- summer Parts Used: Rhizomes (roots) Primary Medicinal Activities: Expect- orant; sedative; respiratory stimulant; lubricates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; antibacterial, fun- gicide, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Lungs Preparation: Decoction or tincture Common Uses: Elecampane has long been regarded as a valuable medicine for a wide variety of lung disorders. Among herbalists, it is regarded as an expectorant that also lends antibacter- ial support, mild cough-suppressive qualities, and relief to mucous mem- branes by virtue of its slippery, oily, soothing mucilage. In other words, elecampane helps make coughing more productive by stimulating excre- tion of mucus, acts to protect and lubricate inflamed mucous membranes in the respiratory tract while inhibiting bacterial infection, and serves to sup- press the cough response just enough so that the body is relieved of unneces- sary stress. Unfortunately, relatively lit- tle scientific study has been performed to support all of these claims. Science has uncovered evidence to suggest that elecampane may have sedative qualities in mice, and we know that Inula helenium E Materia Medica 105 F it contains a volatile oil constituent called alantolactone, which is active against roundworms, whipworms, threadworms, and hookworms in hu- mans. Regardless of a lack of scientific study, this plant has been used for thousands of years as a treatment for bronchitis, pneumonia, and tuberculo- sis—and it is regarded by herbalists as safe enough for use in children with a dry, irritating cough. In animals, we find it useful for soothing a raspy hack that is the result of too much trail dust or perhaps even for kennel cough. Proper dose and duration of therapy must be determined through recogni- tion of specific symptoms and should be based on the special needs of the individual animal. Most of what we know about this herb is centered on the hands-on experience of those who are familiar with it. Therefore, if ele- campane seems to be a viable option for your animal, seek the advice of a holistic practitioner before you pro- ceed with its use. Availability: The dried rhizome or tinc- ture is available through herb retailers. Plants, root cuttings, and seeds are avail- able through specialty nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Elecampane likes full sun and a moist clay loam with an acid pH of 4.5 to 6. Aside from these requirements, you can grow it just about anywhere. Roots are dug in the fall of their second year. They can then be processed into tincture while fresh or dried in a warm location for future use. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For res- piratory disorders associated with heavy congestion, elecampane com- bines well with mullein or grindelia. For kennel cough, it can be combined with coltsfoot. Cautions and Comments: Elecampane has been shown to be highly allergenic in animals and humans with sensitivity to plants in the sunflower (Asteraceae) family. FENNEL Foeniculum vulgare Parsley Family Appearance: Fennel looks very much like dill—delicate finely divided leaves, yellow umbel flowers, and hollow stems. The most obvious difference between fennel and dill is the aromatic nature of the plants—fennel smells somewhat like anise (or licorice), whereas dill smells like, well, dill pickles. Fennel also has sturdier stems and a proportionately large bulb, which is considered a gour- met delicacy by salad and sautéed veg- etable connoisseurs. The entire plant may grow in excess of 6 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Native to Eurasia, fennel has become a full-time, natural- ized resident in the southern half of California, where it is frequently found on the edges of waste areas. Cycle and Bloom Season: There are many subspecies of Foeniculum vulgare— many are perennials, others are annuals or biennials. In northern climes, fennel usually grows as an annual. Parts Used: Seeds, leaves, roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, relieves stomach cramps, stimulates milk production, stimulates digestion, nutritive, and antibacterial Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract Preparation: Fresh or dried leaves, seeds, or roots; or a tincture of the seeds or roots Herbs for Pets 106 Common Uses: Fennel seed is among the first herbs to reach for in cases of flatulence or colic. Its activity in the digestive tract is similar to that of cat- nip. Fennel tastes different from any mint, however, and its flavor is often favored by dogs and cats who dislike “minty” herbs. About 20 percent of cats won’t go near a flake of catnip, making fennel the herb of choice for gastric upset and irritability. In chronic cases, it serves as a gentle antigas and antispas- modic agent that can be added directly to the animal’s food to bring sympto- matic relief while the caretaker looks for the deeper cause of the problem. In acute cases, such as when your horse finds an open bag of molasses and oats that you forgot to put away (or when she grazes on too much fresh alfalfa because you left a gate open), fennel may help to reduce the subsequent bloating that is caused by intestinal gas buildup. For flatulence or colic, horses can be free-fed fresh fennel greens—as much as they want—until they find relief. For dogs and cats, fennel seed works to relieve gastric discomfort from the “no-no’s” that are inevitably con- sumed as a result of human weakness such as tidbits fed from the Thanksgiving dinner table or from the dishes that “can wait until morning.” A cooled tea works well for this purpose— 1 teaspoon of the fresh or dried seeds (fresh are better) in 8 ounces of boiling water, steeped until cool. The tea can be fed at a rate of 2–4 tablespoons for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, or it can be added to drinking water as generously as the animal will allow. A glycerin tincture also works well, especially for finicky animals, because it allows for the convenience of a small dosage of 10–20 drops (or more precisely, up to 0.75 milliliters) per 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, as need- ed. Fennel is high in vitamin C, vitamin A, calcium, iron, and potassium and has varying amounts of linoleic acid. It is an especially good nutritional adjunct for dogs and cats with chronic indigestion that cannot be attributed to a specific disease entity. Fennel also helps increase appetite and reduce bad breath by mini- mizing belching and by acting as an anti- bacterial in the mouth. The leaf tea is said to be an effective skin and coat rinse for repelling fleas. Traditionally, fennel is fed to increase milk flow in nursing mothers. Availability: Fennel seed, root, and sometimes the greens can be found in food stores that stock specialty vegeta- bles. Fennel tinctures are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Fennel is easy to grow from seed or nursery Foeniculum vulgare f Materia Medica 107 f starts. It does best in areas with a cool climate and likes light, dry, slightly alkaline soil. The seeds should be har- vested in the fall, just as they begin to dry and turn to a light brown color. The leaves and flowers can be harvested and used anytime. For food use, the 1- inch-wide bulbs are “blanched” throughout the remainder of their growth by covering them with hills of soil. This makes the bulbs white and tender with a mild flavor. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Catnip serves as an excellent alternative, as does anise seed, celery seed, or dill seed. For chronic flatulence, try using a bitter herb such as dandelion leaf or Oregon grape a few minutes before each feeding. Fennel can then be used after meals if flatulence persists. Cautions and Comments: The volatile oils in fennel are thought to cause or contribute to photosensitive dermatitis in some animals, but such occurrences are rare. In general, this herb is safe. FEVERFEW Tanacetum parthenium Sunflower Family Appearance: Feverfew is a stout, fast- growing plant with sturdy ridged stems, deeply divided alternate leaves, and yel- low-centered white flowers that look like miniature (1-inch-wide) white daisies. The entire plant is aromatic. Habitat and Range: Feverfew is native to the Balkan region of Europe and has since been naturalized throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial or biennial that usually blooms from June through August Parts Used: All aerial parts Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- inflammatory, helps reduce arthritic inflammation (antirheumatic), dilates blood vessels, insecticidal, promotes menstruation Strongest Affinities: Vascular, gas- trointestinal, and reproductive systems Preparation: Dried herb, tincture, and tea Common Uses: Feverfew has become a well-known remedy for migraine suffer- ers. Several studies have shown that part of its effectiveness in treating migraines is attributable to a group of chemicals known as sesquiterpene lactones (espe- cially parthenolide) that are contained in the plants’ leaves and flowers. These com- pounds act to inhibit platelet aggregation Tanacetum parthenium Herbs for Pets 108 in the bloodstream, thus preventing blockage of small capillaries and helping to relieve the pounding, high-pressure pain of a migraine headache. In animals, this activity helps relieve posttrauma or postsurgical discomfort, especially where capillary circulation is diminished or impaired. Feverfew has been shown to block or inhibit the release of histamine, serotonin, thromboxane, and prosta- glandins, while inhibiting proliferation of certain types of mononuclear cells in the synovia of injured or arthritic joints. This means that feverfew might be useful in the proactive reduction of inflammation associated with arthritis, joint injuries, and various other diseases. Feverfew is especially useful in cats as an alternative to aspirin, which can be toxic to felines. And many of the classic anti-inflammatory herbs, including wil- low, poplar, and meadowsweet, contain salicylic acids, the natural precursors to aspirin. Feverfew may not address pain as directly as aspirin, but it does not con- tain any salicylate compounds and can therefore be used with a greater margin of safety. A glycerin-based tincture works well for this purpose, as does a cooled tea. A safe starting dosage is 12–20 drops of the tincture or 1⁄2 teaspoon of a strong tea for each 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight, twice daily. The upper parts of feverfew (especial- ly the flowers) contain pyrethrins, com- pounds that are known to paralyze fleas. To make a flea rinse for your pet, pour boiling water over some fresh herbs. Cover the container, and let the mixture stand until it is completely cooled. Strain the herb from the liquid, and pour the liquid onto your animal’s coat, making sure that it soaks down to the skin. Do not towel dry your pet. Let the rinse dry naturally and be sure to use all of the rinse as the pyrethrin will not remain active for more than a few hours. Availability: Feverfew is readily avail- able wherever herbal remedies are sold. The plants are available through most nurseries. For use against fleas, however, you really need a fresh plant—so plant one in your garden. Propagation and Harvest: Feverfew is easy to grow from seed or nursery starts. The plants are extremely winter hardy, drought resistant, and tolerant of poor soil. Tuck a plant into the corner of your garden, give it a little water, and watch it grow. (In fact, it will reseed its way right out of the garden!) Harvest the leaves and flowers as you need them. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For relief from pain and inflammation, feverfew combines well with skullcap, valerian, and licorice. For fighting fleas, combine with yarrow and celery or dill seed. Cautions and Comments: I (Greg) have heard that feverfew should never be fed fresh, because it may cause mouth ulcers. But throughout two decades of using and recommending this herb, I have yet to witness an adverse side effect. Nevertheless, caution dictates that we should take care in assuring that the herb is entirely dried first. FLAX Linum spp. Flax Family Appearance: Almost three hundred species of flax are distributed worldwide. The most common species have bright blue, five-petaled, 1⁄2- to 1-inch-wide flowers, narrow single-veined leaves, small five-chambered fruits, and wirelike stems that sway in the slightest breeze and seem to have a hard time support- ing their own weight. Plants range in height from 6 to 32 inches. f Materia Medica 109 f Habitat and Range: Common blue flax (Linum perenne) and several other blue-flowered species are found in prairies, in open meadows, and along roadways throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or perennial (depending on species) that blooms from June to August and reseeds itself readily Parts Used: Seeds (called flaxseed) Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutri- tive, soothes the digestive tract, laxative, antioxidant, tonic Strongest Affinities: Skin, nervous system, digestive system Preparation: Ground seeds, seed oil, stabilized seeds Common Uses: Flaxseed contains alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid, as well as omega-3 fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are important in the develop- ment and maintenance of a healthy brain, liver, heart, and immune system— in fact, these acids are so important, ani- mals cannot survive without them. Several studies have confirmed that omega-3 fatty acids are essential factors in the brain development of young ani- mals and may even help protect the brain against certain types of neurotox- ins. Numerous studies also have shown that daily supplementation with EFAs may dramatically improve the skin, coat, and nails in animals who receive it as a supplement to a good diet. Essential fatty acids have been linked to retinal development and antioxidant activities. The point is this: All animals require EFAs in order to enjoy healthy lives. The prob- lem is that many animals do not receive enough to adequately support their bod- ies’ needs and, as a result, suffer from chronic diseases that could have been easily prevented. Flaxseed oil is one of the richest plant source of omega-3 fatty acids known to humanity—but it is not the “totally complete,” stand-alone source of omega-3 fatty acids we once thought. A piece of the complex puzzle is missing, namely, gamma linolenic acid (GLA)—a fatty acid that is needed to support the body’s inflammatory responses to allergens and other inflam- matory stimuli. The problem is due to the lack of a critical enzyme, called delta- 6 desaturase (or D6D), that is needed to convert the linoleic acid constituents in flax into GLA. Although most mammals, including humans, should be able to produce D6D, most cannot. This is due to environmental factors, such as various pollutants, and perhaps even emotional stress factors, which have been shown to inhibit the body’s production of this Linum sp. Herbs for Pets 110 important enzyme. So if you are searching for a more complete omega-3 supple- ment, you should turn to fish oil, borage seed oil, or chia seed. All of these sources already contain gamma linoleic acids, and no metabolic conversion (or D6D) is required for the body fully utilize it. There are various ways to feed flaxseed to an animal. One option is to buy a nutritional supplement that includes flaxseed as part of a balanced herbal formula. Other options are to buy the seeds in their whole form and grind them immediately before adding them to your companion’s food. You can also use flaxseed oil. When deciding which form of flaxseed is best for you and your companion, you should consider several factors. First, it’s important to know that flaxseed oil (the fraction of the plant that contains the highest concentration of EFAs) becomes rancid very quickly. While flaxseed oil offers omega-3 EFAs in a form that can be fed in relatively small quantities and that is quickly and com- pletely absorbed into the body, it requires constant refrigeration and its shelf life is variable and unpredictable. On the other hand, its flavor is relatively easy to mask in an animal’s food. If you wish to use flax for digestive problems, you will need the seeds. Whole seeds keep for several months if refrigerated but must be ground into powder each time they are used. If you grind them ahead of time, they will quickly spoil. The freshly ground seeds can be used as an EFA supplement, but it’s difficult to gauge the amount of EFAs your animal receives with each feeding because as the seeds age, their EFA content deterio- rates. Another problem with the seed option is palatability—many animals don’t like the flavor of ground flaxseeds, and getting an appreciable amount of the powder into a finicky animal can be challenging. The solution: buy a natural pet product that contains stabilized flaxseed. Stabilized flaxseed is treated with zinc and vitamin B6, which makes the seed taste better and helps to prevent the EFA-containing oil from becoming ran- cid. If you buy a stabilized flaxseed prod- uct that is designed especially for ani- mals, follow the manufacturer’s feeding instructions. You can also buy stabilized flaxseed that is intended for humans and prorate the recommended dose up or down to your animal’s body weight. Human doses are generally based on the needs of a 150-pound person; therefore, if you have a 50-pound dog, you need to feed the dog one-third of the recom- mended dose for humans. It’s also a good idea to consult your veterinarian for the correct dosage for your pet’s weight. If you don’t wish to use a stabilized flaxseed product and have access to a source of fresh flaxseed, buy weekly sup- plies and grind a 1⁄2 teaspoon of the seed into a fine powder for each 20 pounds of your animal’s body weight. Sprinkle the powder onto your companion’s food each day, and be sure that she has plen- ty of water to drink with her meal because flaxseed absorbs water and gains mass while in the stomach. This swelling action is due to the combined fiber, mucilage, and oil content of the seed, which make flaxseed an excellent herb for colic, constipation, and other digestive problems. The oily mucilage of the seed helps lubricate the digestive tract while the swollen fibers serve as a safe but efficient intestinal cleanser (it works the same way as psyllium husks do). For cases of constipation, 1 tea- spoon of ground flaxseed can be thor- oughly mixed with 4 ounces of cool water. Allow the mixture to stand for an hour, or until it thickens—you should be able to rub a drop between your thumb f Materia Medica 111 g and forefinger and feel its oily nature. If the mixture doesn’t feel slippery, add more powder and let it stand again. The idea is to activate the flaxseed before putting it into your companion’s body and thus alleviate any possibility of expansion-related discomfort. Once you get a slippery consistency, 2 teaspoons of the mixture can be fed for each 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight (start with 1⁄2 teaspoon in cats). If possi- ble, the slurry should be fed on an empty stomach so the mixture can work its way throughout the digestive tract. Propagation and Harvest: Flax is easy to grow from seed. Simply scatter the seeds as thinly as possible, rake them into the top 1⁄8 inch of soil, and water thoroughly. Sprouts will usually emerge within seven days. Flax is a pretty border plant, but it really isn’t a practical herb to grow for medicinal purposes. It takes several plants to yield a useful quantity of seed, which must be thrashed and sepa- rated from the stems, leaves, and seed capsules. Without special equipment, this is a tedious task that yields only a handful of seeds that could have been purchased for a few cents at a health food store. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Borage seed oil, evening primrose oil, and black currant seed oil are also excellent sources of EFAs. Flaxseed oil can be combined with cod liver oil or other fish oils to make a rounded supplement of omega- 3 and omega-6 fatty acids. For digestive problems, psyllium husks, plantain, and marshmallow serve as good alternatives. Cautions and Comments: Dry flax- seeds should be fed with plenty of water, otherwise digestive upset and discomfort may result from rapid expansion of the seed fibers in the digestive tract. The best way to avoid this possibility is to premix flaxseed with water prior to feed- ing or to use a balanced flaxseed formu- la that is specially designed to be used in powder form. GARLIC Allium sativum Lily Family Appearance: Need we describe garlic? It’s what makes Italian dishes worth- while. It is the aromatic bulb that repels vampires yet attracts hungry people with its nose-tantalizing, mouthwater- ing scent. While most of us can readily identify a head of garlic in the super- market, relatively few of us are familiar with the living green plant. Garlic is a member of the Allium genus, a branch of the lily family that also includes hun- dreds of varieties of onions, leeks, chives, and shallots. In terms of appear- ance, the numerous varieties of garlic are differentiated from what we know as onions by the nature of their bulbs (commonly known as heads) and their leaves. Commercial varieties of garlic produce heads that are divided into segments (cloves), whereas onion bulbs are comprised of singular, multilayered globes. Garlic leaves are characteristi- cally flat and almost grasslike, whereas most onions’ leaves tend to be hollow and erect. Shallot leaves fall somewhere in between. For the purposes of holistic healing, it’s important to know that all of the Allium species come from the same source—nature. All of the various colors and shapes of onions, garlic, and their relatives have originated from wild Allium species that range throughout the world. On the slopes surrounding our Montana home, several species of wild Allium are among the first greens to emerge from the receding snows of early spring. With their emergence come Herbs for Pets 112 winter-weary bears, grouse, deer, elk, and moose, all of whom wish to indulge, if only briefly, in a snack of garliclike wild onions. As one watches these animals while they browse, it soon becomes apparent that they eat wild onions and garlic to fill some instinctive need other than hunger— they pick and choose only a few select plants, then move on to others. Could it be they know something we don’t? Certainly! It is obvious that nature put the Allium genus here for reasons far deeper than epicurean delight. Fortunately for those who cannot for- age the wilds of North America on behalf of their pets, the “supermarket varieties” of garlic are of optimum medicinal potency. Habitat and Range: It has been the- orized that garlic’s wild ancestors orig- inated from west-central Asia. Garlic’s use as a medicine dates back at least five thousand years, and since then hundreds of cultivars have been prop- agated worldwide. In North America, dozens of varieties can be found in open forest clearings and grasslands at foothill to subalpine elevations. Most are montane residents. Cycle and Bloom Season: Although commercial varieties are typically har- vested during their first year of growth when the bulbs are prime, most Allium species are self-seeding perennials that bloom in midsummer. Parts Used: Bulb (the segments of which are called cloves) Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- bacterial, stimulates the immune system, anticancer, nutritive, antioxidant, expec- torant, lowers blood pressure, antitumor, antiviral, antifungal, tonic Strongest Affinities: Liver, blood, car- diovascular system, immune system Preparation: Fresh, dried, tincture, or oil infusion Common Uses: Garlic contains consid- erable amounts of protein, fiber, potas- sium, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, vitamin A, thiamine, niacin, taurine, zinc, riboflavin, and dozens of other nutritive compounds. A single clove of fresh garlic may contain as much as one hundred sulfur compounds, all of which have been shown to possess medicinal qualities. Most of us who read the ads and labels for garlic preparations or supple- ments at health food stores are continu- ally reminded of allicin—a volatile oil constituent of garlic. Once believed to be the definitive factor in garlic’s healing abilities, allicin represents only a seg- ment of garlic’s complex, medicinally versatile chemistry. This is not to say that allicin is not useful; actually it is one of the most impressive broad-spectrum antimicrobial substances available in nature, with dozens of scientific studies to back up this claim. Researchers have found that allicin may be more effective against harmful microbes than tetracy- cline, a frequently prescribed antibiotic drug. And unlike conventional antibi- otics, garlic works against many forms of virus and won’t compromise populations of beneficial flora in the digestive tract when ingested in the appropriate amounts. Despite its clear value as a healing agent, allicin is not the only healing agent in garlic worth considering. In fact, the presence of allicin in garlic preparations is not required at all in many situations where garlic may prove beneficial. At least thirty other com- pounds that are contained in garlic g Materia Medica 113 g have been shown to be useful for con- ditions that range from skin disorders to cancer. Allicin is an unstable compound that dissipates quickly when exposed to air, moisture, or heat. Unless special meas- ures are taken to preserve it, the allicin content in many garlic preparations are nil by the time they reach someone who needs them. To confront this dilemma, several garlic preparations that have been “standardized to allicin” are avail- able on the market. These extracts, pow- ders, capsules, and tablets have had a certain percentage of allicin added in the laboratory to “guarantee their potency.” Such formulas are safe and effective when used properly for specific antimi- crobial purposes but are generally unnecessary and expensive for use in most other instances where garlic is indi- cated. And, despite the claims of many manufacturers, consumers can’t tell if the allicin content in a standardized preparation still exists at the time of use. Unless a laboratory analysis is performed after the product has reached store shelves, there’s no way of knowing whether the allicin’s potency has van- ished from the formula. Before you use a standardized formu- la, try to find out how the manufacturer can guarantee the allicin content in the product after it leaves the lab. If the company’s answer is satisfactory, then bear in mind that many of garlic’s other medicinal constituents may be absent or overpowered by an unnatural abun- dance of allicin and that you will be using garlic in a manner beyond nature’s design. Regardless of what the manufac- turer might say, nature endows garlic with a specific amount of allicin as well as hundreds of other compounds that serve unified purposes. When we isolate a single constituent from the whole plant, we are no longer working within a natural context, and we limit the healing potential of that plant to the confines of what we know, as opposed to what might be possible. While scientists are beginning to under- stand how single chemical elements and compounds work in or on the body, we still know very little about how they work in a synergistic capacity. In this realm, just beyond our understanding, a great many healing secrets are waiting to be discovered. Any good herbalist will tell you that the whole is always greater than the sum of its parts. The chemical complexity of garlic is good news for the self-reliant herbalist because in addition to allicin, garlic con- tains a multitude of compounds that are stable and easy to use. Despite its wide- spread recognition as a healthy food for humans, garlic demands some added respect, caution, and therapeutic consid- eration if it is to be used effectively in the Allium sativum care of animals. Here are three general rules of proper use: • Allicin is essential in applications where garlic is to be used as a natural form of antibiotic but may not be necessary if you are using garlic for general health maintenance or other purposes. • If you wish to employ garlic as an antibiotic, you need to use raw garlic or raw garlic juice within three hours of chopping or pressing the fresh cloves, or you need a good garlic extract from a reputable source. A properly dried garlic powder may be useful for inter- nal antibiotic applications as well, though only a residual trace of allicin remains in the powder until it is used. In this case, two compounds, alliin and allinase, meet with enzymes to form allicin as they enter the mouth. The allicin then does its work within the body—from the inside out. If you use garlic as a topical antibiotic, bear in mind that raw garlic juice is strong and may cause acute reddening and irritation of skin and mucous mem- branes if applied undiluted. Cut the juice with olive oil, vegetable glycerin, or water at a starting rate of one part pure garlic juice to two parts inert liquid (oil, water, etc.). If irritation persists, further dilute the juice. Such problems can be avoided by infusing fresh cloves of garlic directly into olive oil. • If you wish to use garlic as a cancer- inhibiting antioxidant agent, immune- system enhancer, blood-thinning agent, cardiovascular tonic, or nutri- tional supplement, any form of garlic will probably have the desired results. Perhaps the only exceptions are preparations of garlic that have been subjected to heat such as pickled, sautéed, boiled, roasted, or otherwise hyperheated cloves that have likely been depleted of their medicinal potential and a considerable percent- age of their nutrients. Used properly and in the correct form, garlic is valuable for treatment of virtual- ly any form of internal or external bacte- rial, viral, or fungal infection, including parasites (such as tapeworms) and pro- tozoan organisms (such as Giardia). Fresh garlic or properly dried powder (from a reputable market source) can be fed as part of your animal’s diet to fight infections of the mouth, throat, respira- tory tract, stomach, or intestines. In sheep, goats, and cows, it is said to help alleviate mastitis. Freshly crushed garlic or fresh garlic juice can be infused or diluted into olive oil for use as a topical antiseptic for minor injuries, ear infec- tions, or mites. The rule here is to be sure the garlic is diluted sufficiently—the volatile oils are strong and can cause burning irritation if applied to the skin in concentrated form. Never apply essential oil of garlic to any part of the body; it’s too concentrated. And never use garlic preparations in the eyes. To use in topical applications, you don’t need much garlic—just enough to impart a mild garlic odor to the oil. To make a garlic oil, crush two or three cloves of garlic, wet them with vodka to help release the oils, and cover them with 4 ounces of olive oil. Shake the mixture vigorously and let it stand in the refriger- ator for an hour before using. The oil should have an obvious, but not over- powering, garlic odor. Within three to twenty-four hours, the allicin will begin dissipating from your oil, and its useful- ness for killing microbes will be dimin- ished. But don’t discard it. It still possess- es immune-supporting and disease- preventing qualities, and it can be added to your pet’s meals. Use 1⁄2 to 1 level tea- spoon per pound of food per feeding, Herbs for Pets 114 g Materia Medica 115 g depending on the oil’s strength. Keep your garlic oil in the refrigerator in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Expect it to keep for no more than a month. Contrary to what many believe, garlic will not act as its own preservative, and old garlic oil may develop botulism—a bacteria that can be deadly to animals and people. The added alcohol (vodka) is not enough to prevent botulism either, but adding 1⁄4 teaspoon of vitamin E oil to the garlic oil before it goes into the refrigerator will help extend its shelf life while adding a new element of nutritional support. As you can see, this justifies the task of mak- ing your own oil. Many commercially prepared oils produced from raw garlic offer no information on how long they will remain fresh and effective. Scientific studies have shown that var- ious compounds in garlic stimulate immune functions in the bloodstream at levels of activity that are unparalleled by any other herb (yes, even by echinacea). Perhaps most intriguing is garlic’s effect on the body’s natural killer cells—those cells that seek out and destroy cancer cells and invading microbes. In a study conducted with human subjects who have AIDS, garlic was found to increase killer cell activity threefold. Similar ani- mal studies have been conducted with similar results. Given the fact that these studies were done on subjects with depressed immune functions, it stands to reason that companion animals with healthy immune functions may benefit from the added measure of immune sup- port supplied through moderate garlic supplementation in their diets. A 1988 study found that diallyl sul- fide, a garlic constituent, prevented tumor formation in rats, and several other studies have shown that garlic inhibits various forms of cancerous growths in the body. This effect may be attributable to the liver-strengthening actions of at least six garlic components. In this capacity, garlic gently enhances overall liver function and triggers en- zyme responses to help break down waste materials before they go into the bloodstream. In other words, garlic helps the liver cleanse the body and thus helps prevent toxic accumulations that may lead to cancerous growths. Garlic also helps to lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels, making it useful for miniature schnauzers, beagles, and other breeds that may be predisposed to hyperlipidemia—a condition that may lead to chronic seizures. Any form of uncooked garlic performs these func- tions, and its use is as simple as sprin- kling it onto an animal’s food. A once-a- day dosage of 1⁄8–1⁄4 teaspoon (powdered or freshly chopped) per pound of food fed is usually sufficient for most animals. We have seen very good results from the use of garlic against tapeworms. Used in powdered, fresh, or extract forms, garlic might not kill these persist- ent parasites, but it will make their living quarters much less desirable. Intestinal parasites don’t seem to like volatile oils or sulfur compounds, and if fed to an animal in correct dosages over a period of one to two months, garlic helps to drive these pests out. In our experiences with dogs, an increase in visible tape- worm segments in an animal’s stool is likely to occur after two to three weeks of daily garlic ingestion. After about two months, populations of these parasites are usually back to acceptable levels, or they may disappear completely. Garlic works in a similar fashion against protozoan infestations such as giardiasis, but in these cases a strong presence of allicin is needed to be effec- tive. Use fresh garlic and add Oregon grape root to your animal’s diet. This adds an antimicrobial “double punch” against these tough organisms. Garlic is one of the best all-around cardiovascular tonics in the plant world. In studies conducted in collaboration with the New York Department of Health, a component called ajoene found in both fresh and dried forms of garlic was found to be effective at pre- venting the formation of blood clots in the vascular system. In some provinces of France, racehorses suffering from blood clots are routinely fed garlic in their grain feed, and, as a result, the clots sometimes disappear in a matter of days. In fact, many researchers believe that garlic may be as useful as aspirin in this capacity, which makes it especially promising for use in cats since they cannot tolerate the salicylate con- stituents of aspirin. Garlic has also been shown to reduce cholesterol levels and the occurrence of atherosclerosis (fat buildup in the arteries) in both animals and humans, thus reducing the possibil- ity of stroke or heart attack. All of these attributes, combined with the immune- supportive, liver-strengthening capabili- ties of garlic, make this herb an excel- lent multisystem tonic for older ani- mals—especially dogs, who tolerate regular feeding of garlic better than cats do. Garlic’s effectiveness as a systemic flea or mosquito repellent is the subject of a great deal of debate among those who have tried it. Some people claim good results; others believe that the usefulness of garlic in this capacity is largely unfounded. Availability: Supermarkets and health food retailers Propagation and Harvest: Garlic is easy to grow. When sown in the fall, the plants thrive in even the harshest of winter climates, usually producing bulbs by late summer. A sandy loam with a slightly alkaline pH level is the best growing medium. In areas where winters are mild, the cloves can be pressed about 1 inch into the soil in late fall for an early summer crop. In north- ern climes, plant your cloves 4 inches deep as late as you can still work the soil in fall. Cover your planting with at least 6 inches of mulch. Expect to see sprouts shortly after the last hard frost. Garlic should be harvested in midsummer to late summer, after the tops of the plants have died back. Dig up the bulbs, then allow them to dry in the sun for two or three days before you store them in a cool, dry place indoors. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For topi- cal treatment of bacterial infections, con- sider Oregon grape, Saint-John’s-wort, bee balm, thyme, and chamomile as alternatives. For immune system and antioxidant support, investigate echi- nacea, astragalus, licorice, alfalfa, red clover, and burdock as adjuncts or alter- natives. For treating giardiasis and E. coli infections, garlic combines well with Oregon grape or organically raised goldenseal. Cautions and Comments: Toxic side effects from the consumption of garlic are rare in animals and humans alike, but the possibility of harming your dog, your cat, or your herbivore with garlic does exist, and there is a growing controversy about how much garlic is enough and how much is too much. At the root of this con- troversy is a dangerous misconception: the notion that more garlic is always bet- ter. Despite all of the grand attributes we have just described, moderation—the car- dinal rule of all herb use—applies strictly to garlic, particularly when it is used in cats. When misused (used excessively or over an extended period), garlic may cause Heinz-body anemia, a potentially Herbs for Pets 116 g Materia Medica 117 g life-threatening blood disease. Scientists theorize that two chemical compounds contained in garlic may be related to this disorder: s-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, or n- propyl disuldhide. These compounds are believed to deplete a naturally occurring glucose enzyme called Glucose-6-phos- phate dehydrogenase (G6PD). This enzyme has a special function of protect- ing the walls of red blood cells. Depletion of G6PD causes oxidative damage to the cells, thus forming Heinz bodies and trig- gering the body to reject them from the bloodstream (usually via dark-colored urine). If left unchecked, this process con- tinues until the numbers of red blood cells are lowered to the point that the animal becomes anemic and eventually dies. Fortunately, this nightmare is easily pre- vented with some common sense and a few precautions. Other side effects of garlic are more predictable and less threatening: digestive upset and gas when ingested (in which case, reduce the dose and relieve the gas with chamomile) or redness and irritation when applied to the skin (usually indica- tive of a preparation that is too concen- trated). First, it stands to reason that animals with preexisting anemic conditions should not receive garlic internally in any quanti- ty. Puppies don’t begin reproducing new red blood cells until after six to eight weeks of age. Until then, they need every red blood cell they are born with, so a diet that includes garlic is not appropriate for young puppies. It’s important to know that the possi- bility of Heinz-body anemia is dose dependent, meaning the more garlic fed, the greater the chances of a prob- lem developing. While we still don’t know exactly how much is too much, most recorded instances of Heinz-body anemia in animals involve the ingestion of large quantities of onions and other garlic relatives, many of which are likely to contain much larger percentages of enzyme-depleting constituents than a typical dose of garlic. Recorded cases of allium poisoning typically involve onion doses exceeding 0.5 percent of the sub- ject animals’ body weight—this means that a healthy 60-pound dog would have to eat a whole 5-ounce onion, or several cloves of garlic, just to start the Heinz- body process. And since red blood cells are regenerated quickly from the bone marrow, this grotesque overdose would probably have to be repeated several times on a frequent basis to cause per- manent harm. In further defense of gar- lic, several other foods can cause Heinz- body anemia as well—large amounts of turnips, kale, rape, or anything rich in vitamin K may lead to the disorder, espe- cially in herbivores. Small doses of garlic added to your companion animal’s food three or four days per week, perhaps 1⁄8 teaspoon of garlic powder per pound of food fed, are probably going to be of great benefit to the overall health of your pet. Just don’t overdo it. Cats are much more sensitive to the side effects of garlic than dogs are, so they require more caution and attention with its use. Watch for digestive upset and behavioral changes. And if your cat simply doesn’t want any garlic, don’t force the issue. Your cat’s behavior may be more than just a finicky attitude—animals know their needs better than we do. Remember to use common sense and moderation and to have respect for gar- lic as more than just a table condiment. No two animals are alike; one person’s miracle cure is another one’s poison. If you wish to use garlic in a therapeutic capacity, get to know your animal first, then consult a professional (or carefully read the label on your garlic product) before you proceed. GINKGO Ginkgo biloba Ginkgo Family Appearance: Characterized by its unique fan-shaped leaves, ginkgo is a slow-growing tree that may reach 100 feet in height. A healthy tree can live to be one thousand years old. Ginkgo is one of the oldest plant medicines on earth. In fact, it is one of the oldest species of trees still in existence. Habitat and Range: It is estimated that the Ginkgo genus once included several hundred varieties that spanned the globe for over two million years. Today, however, there is only one species, G. biloba, a native of China that has been introduced into North America and most of Europe and Asia for ornamental and medicinal purposes. Cycle and Bloom Season: Ginkgo is a deciduous tree that blooms in early spring, just as the leaves are beginning to develop into their fanlike shapes. Fruits (known as ginkgo nuts) develop and ripen by midsummer. The leaves turn yellow and begin falling in early to late fall. Parts Used: Although ginkgo nuts were used almost exclusively for thou- sands of years, the fall-harvested leaves are of primary interest to contemporary herbalists. Primary Medicinal Activities: Dilates blood vessels, anticoagulant, antioxi- dant, tonic Strongest Affinities: Brain, circulatory system, eyes Preparation: Tincture, tea, capsule Common Uses: Over four hundred sci- entific studies have been conducted to validate ginkgo’s effectiveness in both animals and humans. In fact, in Germany and other European countries, G. biloba extract (commonly known as GBE) is among the most frequently prescribed drugs of commerce. For a long time it was thought that almost all of ginkgo’s medicinal activity could be attributed to two groups of chemical constituents: flavone glycosides and terpene lactones. Dozens of human and animal studies have shown that these two groups of constituents act to improve blood circulation in small capil- laries, a trait that makes gingko espe- cially useful in the treatment of various forms of vascular deficiency—including the effects of old age. But current research indicates that these com- pounds represent only a small part of a complex array of interactive compo- nents. Specifically, ginkgo inhibits the platelet aggregation factor (PAF), the mechanism that causes slow-moving or obstructed blood to become “sticky” and begin forming into clots. Ginkgo does this especially well in small capillar- ies that are particularly susceptible to blockage and that serve tissues that are not reached by larger vessels such as areas of the brain, ears, and extremities. Ginkgo also helps regulate the tone and elasticity of blood vessels, making them stronger and less susceptible to degener- ative disease. These actions make ginkgo a first choice cerebrovascular tonic for older animals. Increased blood flow in capillary-rich tissues of the brain means that the brain is better fed and oxygenat- ed, which in turn can reduce the likeli- hood of stroke and may equate to a longer, higher-quality life for your pet. In fact, several studies have shown that the cerebrovascular activities of ginkgo may be beneficial in treating degenerative Herbs for Pets 118 g Materia Medica 119 g age-related cases of chronic depression or abnormal behavior. If the brain is not getting the blood it needs, mood and behavior will likely be affected—and Rover might start getting rather snippy in his old age. Most of the current hoopla surround- ing ginkgo is focused on its use in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, but its effec- tiveness as a vascular tonic in other parts of the body deserves equal considera- tion. Ginkgo works as an effective vascu- lar tonic throughout the body, especially in smaller, peripheral capillaries of the legs, ears, and rectum. This makes it use- ful in a wide variety of circumstances where circulation has been impaired by trauma, chronic or degenerative disease, or surgical intervention. By opening up and strengthening the structural integrity of small capillaries in impaired areas, gingko improves circulation and enables the body to heal itself more effectively, which is the primary goal of using herbal tonics. Ginkgo also has been used for hun- dreds of years as a tonic for weak kidney function. While relatively little research has been conducted to validate such use, ginkgo’s effectiveness in this capacity is likely attributable to the same vascular tonic activities since the kidney is a blood-dependent organ. In fact, its vul- nerability and demise in the event of diminished blood supply is second only to the brain. In recent months, we have heard from veterinarians and pet own- ers who have been using an herbal combination that includes ginkgo and hawthorn in the treatment of early-stage renal failure. The anecdotal reports claim a general improvement in kidney function. This makes sense because hawthorn acts to reduce blood pressure as it increases circulation within the larger arteries, while ginkgo serves to open and tonify the smaller vessels. In addition to its vascular actions, gink- go also works as a nervous system tonic in the brain. Although the mechanisms of its neurological activity are complex and still hold many mysteries, studies indicate that ginkgo somehow increases energy levels in the brain and stimulates the release of various neurotransmitters, many of which regulate constriction of important smooth-muscle tissues throughout the body—such as those of the heart, bladder, and uterus. The fact that ginkgo works to influence brain function in ways that are exclusive of its circulatory activities makes for a broad scope of therapeutic useful- ness. In many cases, urinary incontinence, seizures, various forms of neuralgia, skin problems, chronic digestive upset, cardiac arrhythmia, and behavioral disorders (to name just a few) may be the result of cere- brovascular or neurological dysfunction that might be relieved with the proper use of ginkgo. Ginkgo biloba Many studies suggest that GBEs have been standardized to contain at least 24 percent ginkgolides. In our opinion, however, excellent results can be obtained from any high-quality extract of the leaves. A typical dose for elderly animals or for those who exhibit early signs of cerebrovascular deficiency, kid- ney failure, or impaired circulation in the extremities is anywhere between 0.25 milliliters and 0.75 milliliters of the liquid extract, two or three times daily for each 50 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Exact dosage varies according to the specific circumstances of disease, size of the animal, potency of the extract, and duration of use. In other words, you are advised to seek a qualified holistic practi- tioner for a complete workup of your animal before proceeding with ginkgo therapy. Availability: Widely available through health food stores and herb retailers. Ginkgo trees are available through land- scape nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Ginkgo trees are not difficult to grow—all they need is room to spread their roots, a moderate climate (hardy in the southern two-thirds of North America), and some water from time to time. The problem is that they are slow growers, with yearly growth often measured in fractions of an inch. If you are lucky enough to have access to a mature ginkgo tree, however, take advantage of the fresh leaves, which are far superior to the dried leaves that are available at herb stores. Analysis of ginkgo leaves indicates that the broadest diversity of medicinal constituents is found when the leaves are just begin- ning to turn yellow (in the fall). Gather the leaves just as they are turning yellow, before they fall from the tree and in advance of any evidence of mold on the leaf surfaces. The leaves can then be used fresh to make tincture, or they can be dried for future use. The dried leaves keep for about one year. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Gingko combines well with hawthorn for car- diovascular or kidney disorders. For use as a general vascular tonic, ginkgo can be combined with garlic, cayenne, or yarrow. Cautions and Comments: By most standards, ginkgo is safe. But because of its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation in the blood, its use may be contraindi- cated in the presence of blood-thinning drugs or in animals with blood-clotting disorders. While ginkgo improves the body’s ability to heal after surgery, its use should be delayed until all risk of postop- erative hemorrhage has passed. GOLDENROD Solidago spp. Sunflower Family Appearance: Goldenrod is a common wayside weed that is easy to identify by its spire-shaped or triangular clusters of tiny bright goldenrod-yellow flowers. The leaves of the most common species are narrowly lance-shaped and may or may not have serrated edges. Plants are erect and range from 2 inches (Solidago multiradiata—mountain goldenrod) to 70 inches (S. canadensis; S. occidentalis; S. gigantea) in height. Most species share similar appearances. This is especially true of the larger species, which may dif- fer only in leaf texture or the presence of stem hairs. Habitat and Range: The Solidago ge- nus can be divided into two categories: those that grow in moist soils and those that prefer drier habitats. Generally Herbs for Pets 120 g Materia Medica 121 g speaking, most of the smaller mountain varieties are found in dry soils, often at the edges of forest roads or in open meadows. The larger varieties are com- mon to river and lake habitats, irrigated fields, drainage ditches, and so on, from below sea level to about 4,000 feet in elevation. Several species are widespread throughout North America, with S. canadensis (Canada goldenrod) being perhaps the most common. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennial, sometimes annual. Blooms throughout the summer months Parts Used: Entire flowering plant— roots and all Primary Medicinal Activities: Astrin- gent, tonic, diuretic, reduces inflammation of respiratory mucosa (anticatarrhal), strengthens kidney functions (nephritic), anti-inflammatory, helps prevent or elimi- nate urinary stones (antilithic), antibacteri- al, antifungal, stops bleeding Strongest Affinities: Respiratory tract, urinary tract, and kidneys Preparation: Dried herb, tincture, tea Common Uses: As with many common wayside weeds, goldenrod’s usefulness is usually overshadowed by that of other herbs that have greater mass-market appeal. This is unfortunate because while many people spend their hard-earned money on the latest herb sensation, a better alternative may be growing in profuse abundance just behind the house. Goldenrod is one such herb. It is extremely useful but far less marketable than many others simply because it is too abundant to give notice to. Goldenrod is an excellent antica- tarrhal, an herb that helps to reduce the production of mucus in the bronchi by decreasing inflammation of the mucous membranes. While the produc- tion of mucus is essential in the body’s holistic efforts to eliminate pathogens and waste products from the respirato- ry tract during bacterial, viral, or fungal infections, reducing the irritation of swollen membranes helps to comfort the sufferer while making the overall healing effort more productive. For dogs and cats, a teaspoon or two of a flower or leaf tea (made with a tea- spoon of the dried herb in 8 ounces of water, cooled to lukewarm) often brings quick relief for a persistent wet cough. Horses and other large herbi- vores can be fed a handful or two of the fresh herb for the same purpose. Although relatively little scientific research has been conducted into gold- enrod’s effectiveness as a kidney tonic, it has been used successfully in this Solidago canadensis capacity for hundreds of years. Spe- cifically, goldenrod is said to boost renal function quickly, making it espe- cially helpful for acute cases of nephri- tis, especially where anuresis (an inabil- ity to pass urine from the kidneys) is a prevalent symptom. Goldenrod can also be useful in preventing or assisting in the elimination of kidney stones. However, the activities of goldenrod may be contraindicated in advanced chronic cases of kidney disease, where stimulation of renal function may cause added stress to overworked kidneys. The various mechanisms and patholo- gies of kidney disease are difficult to assess accurately, and finding the cor- rect approach should be left to your holistic veterinarian. In topical applications, goldenrod has remarkable hemostatic qualities, espe- cially when the dried and powdered flowers are used. The powder can be applied liberally to stop bleeding and inhibit bacterial infection of minor cuts and abrasions. Goldenrod may moderate allergic reactions to airborne pollen and other allergens if taken for several weeks prior to the start of hay fever season. When a measured amount of golden- rod—a potentially allergenic plant—is introduced into the body just before hay fever season, the body begins building its antiallergen defenses before the real onslaught. Availability: Available through herb retailers; profusely abundant in vacant lots and forests throughout North America, Europe, and Asia. Propagation and Harvest: Harvest the entire plant when it is in full bloom. The entire plant can then be chopped and made into a tincture, or it can be dried for later use in teas. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For upper respiratory infections, goldenrod com- bines especially well with echinacea and Oregon grape. Consider mullein, colts- foot, wild cherry, marshmallow, slippery elm, and grindelia as adjuncts or alterna- tives for coughs. Dandelion, couch grass, corn silk, ginkgo, uva ursi, marshmallow, echinacea, and hawthorn should be investigated for treating urinary and kid- ney disorders. Cautions and Comments: Goldenrod has no known toxicity but may be con- traindicated in animals with certain forms of kidney disease. Although gold- enrod is not as allergenic as once thought (often it is blamed for allergies caused by ragweed and other plants), it should be used with caution in animals who are predisposed to pollen allergies. GOLDENSEAL Hydrastis canadensis Buttercup Family Appearance: Goldenseal is a perennial that may grow to 12 inches in height. The main stem of the plant is typically forked to produce two nearly circular 2-inch to 6- inch-wide leaves, one of which is usually larger than the other. The leaves are deeply lobed, five to seven times, with toothed margins. The plant may require three or more years of growth before it blooms, then it produces a single whitish green flower that has no petals. In mid- summer, the flower develops into a single raspberry-like red fruit that contains ten to thirty small seeds. Stems are hairy. The horizontally creeping root is thick and woody. All parts of the root have deep goldenrod-yellow inner tissues. Habitat and Range: The range and population of this North American native are rapidly diminishing. The orig- Herbs for Pets 122 g Materia Medica 123 G inal range of goldenseal once included most of eastern North America—from Minnesota and Vermont south into Georgia. Today, most remaining stands of wild goldenseal are isolated in the central and northern reaches of the Appalachians and, to a lesser extent, the Ozark Mountains. Cycle and Bloom Season: A long-lived perennial that blooms in early spring Parts Used: Primarily the root; to a less- er extent the leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, reduces inflammation of respi- ratory mucosa, tonic, astringent, stimu- lates the liver, antiparasitic Strongest Affinities: Mucous mem- branes of the respiratory tract, lower uri- nary tract, gastrointestinal tract, mouth, and eyes. Preparation: Tincture, tea, or poultice Common Uses: Wild goldenseal is van- ishing because of greed, sensationalism, and misinformed use. The greatest mis- conception about goldenseal is that it acts as an herbal antibiotic in the body, coursing its way through the body sys- tems via the bloodstream to attack any pathogenic microbes in its path. This is untrue. Goldenseal does not act as an antibiotic. In fact, the antimicrobial alka- loids of this plant (namely berberine and hydrastine) act only to inhibit bacteria, fungi, parasites, and protozoan bodies that they come in direct contact with in the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and urinary tract. These infection-fighting compounds are not absorbed into the bloodstream; they simply act as contact dis- infectants. With this in mind, goldenseal can be used against a broad spectrum of pathogens, including Streptococcus sp., Staphylococcus sp., Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella, and several others. As an anti-inflammatory, goldenseal is effective for ulcers and irritations of the mouth, upper respiratory tract, eyes, and, to a lesser degree, the digestive and uri- nary tracts. A poultice made from the powdered root can be applied directly to infections or ulcers in the mouth. Results are often seen within hours of application. For conjunctivitis that is secondary to bacterial or fungal infection in dogs, cats, birds, ferrets, rodents, horses, or reptiles, a goldenseal eyewash serves as a strong antimicrobial agent and also quickly reduces inflammation and red- ness. To use goldenseal in this capacity, make a strong tea from the chopped dry root, then add 12–20 drops of the dark golden-yellow fluid into 1 ounce of ster- ile saline solution—the liquid marketed for people with contact lenses. A few Hydrastis candadensis drops in each eye (or a fraction of a drop for small birds, rodents, and such) two or three times daily usually brings relief quickly. Internally, we like to use gold- enseal in conjunction with garlic for rid- ding our dogs and cats of tapeworms, and we have received good reports from veterinarians we work with who find this combination useful for treating giardiasis or E. coli infections in dogs, cats, and larg- er animals. Studies of the active compo- nent berberine substantiate these claims. Wild goldenseal is one of the most endangered wild medicinal plants in North America, and it is still being exploit- ed by the “bad apples” of the herb in- dustry. Fortunately, goldenseal can be replaced (in most cases) with Oregon grape root (Mahonia aquifolium), a natu- rally abundant member of the barberry family that also contains an impressive amount of the active constituent berber- ine. The continued survival of wild gold- enseal is totally dependent on human conscience and responsibility—if you think you need goldenseal, give Oregon grape a try first. Chances are you will be pleased with the results. If you still see a need for goldenseal, spend the extra money to buy goldenseal roots or gold- enseal preparations that have come from certified organic (cultivated) sources. If you use wildcrafted goldenseal, you are contributing to the rapid demise of a great healing treasure that can never be replaced. Availability: Herb retailers. Please buy goldenseal harvested from a cultivated source only. Propagation and Harvest: If you have a piece of ground that can support gold- enseal, grow some. The future success of this plant may depend on people like you. The best place to plant goldenseal is in the shade of a dense, hardwood canopy of a north-facing hillside. The plant re- quires deep compost-rich, well-drained soil with a pH level between 5.5 and 6.5. With enough shade and the right soil amendments, goldenseal can be propa- gated in a garden as well. Goldenseal can be propagated from stratified seeds or from rhizomes spaced 4 inches apart in rows that are 12 inches apart. Planting should occur in fall. Goldenseal requires at least four to five years (preferably seven) to reach maturity. Alternatives and Adjuncts: In many applications where an antimicrobial or anticatarrhal is indicated, any number of plants that contain the yellow alkaloid berberine can be employed in place of goldenseal. Choices include Oregon grape (Mahonia sp.), twinleaf (Jeffersonia diphylla), or yerba mansa (Anemiopsis cali- fornica). Before any of these herbs are employed, however, a fundamental ques- tion of holistic responsibility should be addressed in the minds of all earth- conscious herb users: Does substituting a wildcrafted herb for an overharvested one benefit the future of wild medicinal plants, or does it simply defer impact onto another species? The fact that Oregon grape is an abundant wild substitute is beside the point. Humanity is efficient at disturbing or depleting virtually anything on earth, and when we elect to abandon one natural resource for another in the absence of proactive holistic thinking, we are only contributing to a continuum of human impact. With this in mind, we should elect to use wild substitutes only when cultivated goldenseal is not avail- able. Coptis sinensis, a species of goldthread that is widely cultivated in China, may also serve as an excellent sub- stitute for goldenseal. A small portion of goldthread or goldenseal added to echi- nacea serves as a direct-intervention “double-punch” for infections of the Herbs for Pets 124 g Materia Medica 125 g mouth, urinary tract, and gastrointestinal tract, while the echinacea does its job at boosting the immune system. Cautions and Comments: Some ani- mal studies have shown that berberine calms the uterus, but other studies show that it stimulates uterine contractions, so it is inadvisable to use goldenseal, Oregon grape, or other berberine-containing plant medicines in pregnant animals. Goldenseal lowers blood sugar, so don’t use it in animals who are hypoglycemic. Goldenseal also may alter the metabolism and may have the potential to cause hypertension. Long-term internal use of goldenseal may overstimulate the liver and trigger excessive production of bile— a situation that is likely to result in vomit- ing. Cats are especially prone to this side effect. In light of this, goldenseal should not be used continuously, in excess of seven days, without a break. For proper dose and duration of therapy, and to ascertain if internal use of goldenseal is indicated for your animal, consult a holis- tic veterinarian. An unpleasant but not really threaten- ing side effect may occur in cats that are fed goldenseal or any other plant that contains berberine: excessive salivation. Since first writing this book we have heard from several cat owners and vet- erinarians who report a “foaming at the mouth.” If this occurs, simply discontin- ue use—it simply means that this may not be the best herbal choice for your particular kitty. GOTU KOLA Centella asiatica Parsley Family Appearance: Gotu kola produces dark green, nearly circular, 1- to 3-inch leaves and purple flowers that are atypical of the parsley family. The leaves have long petioles (stems) and leathery smooth surfaces that give the plant an appear- ance similar to what lily pads would look like if they grew on land instead of in water. Habitat and Range: Gotu kola is a native of India, south Asia, eastern Europe, and the Philippines. It inhabits drainage ditches, streambeds, and moist waste areas, often in ground-covering abundance. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in summer Parts Used: Leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Active against various skin problems (antider- matitic), peripheral vasodilator, helps reduce arthritic inflammation, antioxi- dant, wound healing, diuretic Centella asiatica Strongest Affinities: Skin, nervous system, circulatory system Preparation: Tea or tincture or any variety of topical preparation such as salves, lotions, and poultices Common Uses: Gotu kola is especially useful for burns, skin injuries, or dermati- tis that involve vascular insufficiency or accumulation of subcutaneous swelling. When taken internally it increases peripheral blood circulation and serves as a mild diuretic, thus assisting with the body’s natural ability to cleanse and heal the epidermis. When applied externally, it serves as an antioxidant and speeds the healing process by stimulating regeneration of skin cells. It has also been shown to accelerate the production of healthy scar tissue after surgery. It is known to promote hair and nail growth. Gotu kola is useful in treating leprosy (mycobacteriosis), an ulcerous bacterial infection of the skin that can occur in dogs, cats, and other animals. In these cases, it is believed that a terpene com- pound called asiaticoside breaks down the protective waxy coating of the dis- ease-causing bacteria, leaving the invad- ing microbes vulnerable to the body’s immune system. Recent studies also sug- gest that the betulinic acid content of gotu kola is active against melanoma, a life-threatening form of skin cancer. Gotu kola is said to improve mental clarity and to act as a mild sedative and nervine (moderates nerve transmissions) in animals. In a study where rats were trained to do simple tasks, gotu kola was shown to improve learning and memory. Researchers correlated this finding to a deceleration of neurotransmitter repro- duction in the brain—in other words, memory was retained because the process of neurotransmission remained less interrupted. This makes gotu kola a potential candidate for treating senility in aging animals. Gotu kola may also be useful in the treatment of epilepsy. For animals with arthritis, gotu kola improves circulation in the legs and helps to reduce inflammation. It has also been shown to promote healing and reconstruction of connective tissue in the joints. For external applications, gotu kola can be used as a skin rinse, poultice, or fomentation. Salves and oil infusions work well too, especially when vitamin E oil is added. For internal uses in a dog or cat, a tea from the dried leaves (1 teaspoon of herb to 8 ounces of near- boiling water) can be fed directly or put in the animal’s food. Feed 1 table- spoon of the cooled tea per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight, once daily. Alternatively, a tablespoon of the fresh leaves can be finely chopped and added to each pound of an animal’s food (the young light-green leaves are delicious in salads). Horses can be fed a handful of the leaves each day as a dietary adjunct. A low-alcohol tincture is yet another option. For each 30 pounds of a dog’s body weight, add 0.5–1 milliliter of tincture to food daily. Add 0.5 milliliters of tincture to your cat’s food daily. Availability: Herb retailers and a few specialty seed and plant suppliers Propagation and Harvest: Although gotu kola is seldom grown in North America, its cultivation is certainly possi- ble. The plants must be kept warm—at tropical temperatures—throughout their lives, meaning that they will need a greenhouse or a consistently warm, sun- lit place indoors in order to flourish in most of North America. The plants like nitrogen-rich soil, a mix of shade and sunlight, and room to spread. Herbs for Pets 126 g Materia Medica 127 g Alternatives and Adjuncts: For exter- nal treatment of skin problems, consider calendula, chaparral, aloe, comfrey, and chamomile as alternatives or adjuncts. For internal treatment of skin problems or arthritis, gotu kola combines with alternatives such as burdock, red clover, or yellow dock. Diuretic, nutritive, and cholagogue herbs such as dandelion leaf and root, Oregon grape, cleavers, and nettle should be considered as well. Licorice, devil’s claw, or yucca root serves as anti-inflammatory adjuncts. For vascu- lar problems, gotu kola combines with ginger, cayenne, peppermint, ginkgo, yarrow, or hawthorn. To improve mental clarity and circulation in the brain, add ginkgo to your gotu kola. Cautions and Comments: Although never witnessed by the authors or any- one we consult with, there is some scien- tific literature that presents the theory that excessive doses of gotu kola may have narcotic effects in animals, may cause photosensitivity, and may interfere with hypoglycemic therapies. Large doses may also present abortifacient activities and therefore should not be used in pregnant animals. GRAVELROOT Eupatorium purpureum Sunflower Family Appearance: Gravelroot is a large perennial, sometimes reaching 12 feet tall. The lance-shaped leaves have short petioles and grow directly off of the main stem in whorls of four or more. Leaves are distinctively textured and have coarsely serrated edges. Stems are smooth, succulent, and covered with purple spots, especially at the leaf axils. Flowers are small and pink, presented in showy slightly globe-shaped clusters at the top of the plant. Spotted gravelroot (Eupatorium maculatum) shares the habi- tat of and looks similar to E. purpureum, except the mature plants tend to be much smaller. Both are equally useful. Boneset (E. perfoliatum), a close rela- tive of gravelroot, is a proportionately smaller plant that offers a different range of therapeutic usefulness. Habitat and Range: Gravelroot is common at the edges of moist forest clearings, where it often forms dense thickets. Its range includes most of the eastern United States from Minnesota and Nebraska eastward to the Atlantic Ocean and south to Florida. In the West, E. maculatum is sporadically distributed from South British Columbia to New Mexico. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in midsummer Eupatorium purpureum Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic, anti-inflammatory, tonic, helps reduce arthritic inflammation, helps prevent or eliminate urinary stress Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract Preparation: Decoction or tincture of the root Common Uses: Gravelroot is traditionally used for expelling small kidney and blad- der stones (gravel) from the urinary tract. It is effective for reducing the pain and inflammation of cystitis, and is sometimes used to treat swollen prostates. The diuret- ic activities of gravelroot may help in the elimination of excess uric acid from the body, making it potentially useful in the treatment of gout and other forms of rheumatism. Although little scientific vali- dation exists for the medicinal uses of this plant, its abundance and long-standing reputation among herbalists as a safe and effective urinary tract remedy warrants attention. While this herb has been safely used in dogs and cats, we cannot recom- mend gravelroot as a first-choice herb sim- ply because we don’t know it as well as its alternatives. However, gravelroot is a pro- fusely abundant plant in many areas of North America, and it is a valuable resource when other urinary tract herbs may not be available. It is also a plant that is likely to gain market popularity in coming years, and chances are it will someday enter the market in some kind of pet formula. In any case, gravelroot is a good herb to remem- ber as an emergency standby resource. Availability: Despite its long history as an herbal medicine, commercial sources of gravelroot are difficult to find in many parts of North America, especially in the West. The solution to this problem is simple— grow your own! Seeds are available through specialty catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: This peren- nial is easy to grow. It sends up shoots from its rhizomes shortly after it is planted and forms a self-sufficient thicket. All it really needs is plenty of sun, rich soil, and frequent watering. Plants do best if shel- tered from wind because the stems tend to break easily. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For removal of gravel from the urinary tract, gravelroot is often combined with demulcent herbs such as marshmallow root, plantain, and corn silk. In urinary disorders that also involve inflammation or bleeding, gravel- root can be combined with stronger astrin- gents or other anti-inflammatory herbs such as uva ursi, cleavers, and corn silk. As an alternative, consider couch grass. Cautions and Comments: Only the root of this plant should be used because the leaves, stems, and flowers contain echina- tine, a pyrrolizidine alkaloid that may be harmful to the liver if consumed in large enough quantities. Although direct side effects appear to be rare in animals who eat this plant, raw milk taken from animals who have grazed on gravelroot and then fed to humans and other animals may have toxic effects. The symptoms of over- dose may include weakness, nausea, vom- iting, liver damage, tremors, collapse, diffi- cult breathing, convulsions, coma, or death. It is highly advisable to contact a veterinarian familiar with gravelroot before administering it to your dog or cat. GRINDELIA Grindelia squarrosa Sunflower Family Appearance: When grindelia is first encountered in the field, two thoughts Herbs for Pets 128 g Materia Medica 129 g often come to mind: This is a weed, and this is obviously a member of the sun- flower family. Grindelia has strong but flexible 1- to 3-foot-tall stems, saw- toothed leaves, and bright yellow flow- ers that grow one per stem. Beneath the yellow rays, the flowers have distinctive curved bracts. The flower heads have a sticky gumlike substance that has earned the plant the common name of “gum- weed.” Habitat and Range: Several species of Grindelia range throughout the western two-thirds of North America. All share similar appearances and most are inhab- itants of wide-open plains or dry, sunny forest clearings. Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial or short-lived perennial that reproduces by seed Parts Used: Flowers and leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Ex- pectorant, sedative, cough suppressant, anti-inflammatory, lowers blood pres- sure, relieves poison ivy–induced con- tact dermatitis Strongest Affinities: Respiratory tract and skin Preparation: For internal uses: tincture or tea. For contact dermatitis: tea (skin rinse), salve, lotion, ointment, or lini- ment (an externally applied tincture). Common Uses: Very little scientific attention has been directed toward grindelia, but its effectiveness and useful- ness as a respiratory herb is well known among Western herbalists. Native Americans, who passed their herbal wis- dom to us, used grindelia to treat every- thing from tuberculosis and pneumonia to gonorrhea and postpartum pain. From a scientific perspective, we know that the gummy substance secreted from the flower heads contains at least 20 percent resins, which are composed of substances that stimulate mucus secretion and reduce inflammation in the upper respira- tory tract, making a dry, hacking cough more productive. Adding to grindelia’s expectorant qualities are sedative and antispasmodic activities that calm a spas- tic cough by relaxing the smooth muscles of the upper respiratory tract while dilat- ing the bronchioles. This makes grindelia useful for relieving the symptoms of asth- ma in dogs and cats, especially when it is administered at the early onset of an attack. We also find it useful for easing the symptoms of bordetella (kennel cough). To evaluate whether grindelia is appropri- ate for your pet and to determine a prop- er dosage, talk to a holistic practitioner. Grindelia squarrosa Many North American Indian tribes used decoctions or simple teas of grindelia leaves and flowers as a sooth- ing skin rinse for poison ivy–induced der- matitis, and in recent years, grindelia lotions have started to appear in European markets for the same purpose. A simple homemade decoction or tinc- ture serves this purpose—apply as need- ed to the affected areas once or twice daily. Availability: Grindelia herb or herbal preparations are available through herb retailers. The seed is available through specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Grindelia tolerates poor soil and can be propagat- ed easily from seed. Harvest the flowers and leaves when the plants are in full bloom. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For asth- ma, a small amount of grindelia can be combined with nettle. Look at lobelia as a possible adjunct or alternative. For ken- nel cough and other respiratory infec- tions and irritations, check out hore- hound, coltsfoot, comfrey, mullein, and wild cherry as possible alternatives or adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Internal use of grindelia may have a relaxing effect on the heart muscle and may cause a decrease in blood pressure. As a result, grindelia may be contraindicated in ani- mals with heart or other circulatory problems. Excessive doses of grindelia are believed to cause renal irritation; therefore grindelia may be contraindicat- ed in animals with renal failure or other forms of kidney disease. Although it is generally regarded as nontoxic but unpalatable to livestock and other ani- mals, little research has been done on the effects of grindelia. Its use should be limited to what the holistic pet care com- munity has learned through clinical experience. See your holistic veterinarian before administering this herb internally. Barring allergic sensitivity, external appli- cations are generally safe for home treat- ment of poison ivy dermatitis on most animals. HAWTHORN Crataegus sp. Rose Family Appearance: Hawthorn is a small deciduous tree or large shrub (up to 16 feet tall) that is easily recognized and quickly remembered by its nasty 1- to 3- inch curved thorns that are strategically spaced along the branches, often at eye level. The leaves of most species are nar- rowly fan-shaped or oval. The margins of the 1- to 2-inch-long leaves are toothed with all leaf tips pointing distinctly for- ward. The white 1⁄4-inch flowers are pre- sented in flat clusters, each blossom hav- ing five petals and numerous stamens (the pollen-bearing structures). When in full bloom, the blossoms often have an unpleasant “dead” odor. In late summer, the flowers are replaced with clusters of red to black berries that contain two to five seeds each. Habitat and Range: The Crataegus genus is large and varied with hundreds of species (all of which readily hybridize) in North America. Most species are found in riparian thickets or moist mead- ows, where they serve as important for- age and nesting habitats for birds and other wildlife. They are found in Alaska and British Columbia southward into California and are widely distributed eastward throughout the western interi- or states at valley and foothill elevations. C. douglasii (black hawthorn, see photo) Herbs for Pets 130 h Materia Medica 131 h is one of the most common and wide- spread species. Cycle and Bloom Season: Deciduous perennial; blooms sometime between April and June Parts Used: Fruits (berries) or flowers and leaf buds Primary Medicinal Activities: Tonic (strengthens cardiovascular structures and functions), lowers blood pressure, dilates blood vessels, nutritive, antioxi- dant Strongest Affinities: Cardiovascular system Preparation: Fresh or dried berries, tincture, tea, and decoction Common Uses: Hawthorn berries have been considered one of nature’s best and safest heart and vascular tonics for mil- lennia. A great deal of scientific study has validated hawthorn’s usefulness in this capacity, and herbalists and researchers agree that hawthorn benefits the heart and arteries in at least three ways: • Hawthorn dilates both coronary vessels and vessels of the brain, helping to increase circulation and the transport of nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. It accomplishes this in an effective and unique fashion: while it dilates major vessels, it also increases blood flow from the heart to compen- sate for any reduction of arterial blood volume. In other words, it helps the body push more blood around by increasing cardiac output and decreas- ing blood flow resistance in the arter- ies so there is more blood flow at lower pressure. This effect has been shown in studies performed with dogs, especially when used in small doses over an extended period. • Hawthorn possesses antioxidant prop- erties. It scavenges free-radical mole- cules that are known to rob the blood of oxygen and may lead to various forms of vascular disease. • Hawthorn acts to steady and strength- en a weak or erratic heartbeat. In fact, it has been shown to be a possible alternative to the drug digitalis and may actually serve as a potentiating adjunct to this cardiac drug. All of these activities are largely attribut- able to the vast array of flavonoid con- stituents held in hawthorn. Flavonoids are typified as red pigments found in many kinds of fruits and vegetables, and hundreds of studies have indicated that these compounds are essential in maintaining disease resistance and the Crataegus douglassi integrity of smooth-muscle tissues throughout the body. It so happens that hawthorn may be the richest natural source of these vital nutrients. In a recent study using unfortunate rats, the flavonoid constituents held in hawthorn were shown to help prevent myocardial damage in situations where the heart muscle was subjected to physiological stress. This means that animals such as racehorses and working dogs, who are constantly under cardiovascular stress, are likely to find preventative benefits from daily supplements of hawthorn berries in their diets. It stands to reason that this cardiovascular tonic is useful in the daily care of older animals, especially those who suffer from chronic heart problems such as congestive heart fail- ure, postsurgical dysfunction, or cardiac anomalies that have resulted from heart- worm, bacterial or viral infections, or protracted chemotherapy. When com- bined with herbs that strengthen kidney function, hawthorn may also serve as a good adjunct therapy in the early treat- ment of kidney failure. Hawthorn’s vasodilator and hypotensive actions may help to improve blood circulation through the renal arteries and smaller vessels of the kidneys without the added stress of increased blood pressure. One of the nicest things about using hawthorn in treating animals is the fact that it tastes pretty good and is one of the easiest herbs to feed to your pet. If you are lucky enough to have a hawthorn tree near your home and an animal who likes red fruit, you can pick the ripe berries and feed them as tonic treats. As an alternative, the fully ripe berries can be picked, dried on a clean sheet of paper, and ground by hand with a mortar and pestle (be forewarned: the dried berries burn out small coffee grinders) into a coarse powder. The pow- der can then be added to your pet’s diet—1 teaspoon per pound of food fed each day. If your animal won’t eat the berries either way, try making a tea and pouring it over the food. If that doesn’t work, you can use hawthorn gel capsules wrapped with a little cheese, or, better yet, you can use a low-alcohol hawthorn extract. The berries are the commonly used and marketed part of the hawthorn plant, probably because they make such a pretty and palatable medicine. But in early spring, before the berries are avail- able, the flowering branch ends (leaves, flower buds, twigs, and thorns) can be clipped into small pieces and made into a decoction. Good luck getting it into your animal though—unlike the berries, the “twig tea” tastes awful! Availability: Hawthorn berries and the dried leaves and flowers are available through herb retailers. Various hawthorn preparations are available at health food stores. Propagation and Harvest: A few species of hawthorn are available through nurseries, particularly those spe- cializing in native plants. Hawthorn is not difficult to grow—all it really requires is plenty of water. But it tends to be a slow grower. Gather the berries when they are completely ripe, usually in mid- summer. Depending on the species, the berries are red or blue-red (almost black in the case of C. douglasii). The berries can then be used fresh, or they can be dried for future use. When properly stored, they should keep for at least a year. The flowering end-twigs should be harvested and used as soon as the blos- soms open in early spring. Alternatives and Adjuncts: When combined with a good natural diet and other tonic herbs, hawthorn acts exactly Herbs for Pets 132 h Materia Medica 133 h as an herbal heart tonic should, filling the special cardiac needs in the golden years of an animal’s life. Other tonic herbs can be used in combination with hawthorn to round out the supplemen- tal needs of older animals. These might include ginkgo or yarrow (for strength- ening capillary walls), garlic (for added antioxidant and immune system sup- port), alfalfa and red clover (to nourish the blood, increase appetite, and raise energy levels), dandelion leaf (to assist in the removal of excess water and lend tonic support to the kidneys), and oat- straw (as a nervous system tonic). Cautions and Comments: Hawthorn is safe. In fact, in the hundreds of animal studies that have been conducted with this herb since 1900, hawthorn has shown extremely low toxicity in every animal tested. We place the toxicity potential of hawthorn berries on the same level as that of rose hips, raspber- ries, or blueberries—in other words, hawthorn is a medicinal food. HOP Humulus lupulus Mulberry Family Appearance: Hop is a beautiful trailing vine with deeply lobed leaves reminis- cent of those of grapevines. Habitat and Range: Originally a Eurasian plant, several varieties of hop are grown throughout the world. Many have escaped cultivation and now adorn waste areas, railway easements, and ravines throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in mid– to late summer. Parts Used: Strobiles (strobili), com- monly known as hops Primary Medicinal Activities: Seda- tive, diuretic, stimulates digestion Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, urinary tract, digestive tract Preparation: Tea, tincture, fresh stro- biles Common Uses: Unlike many of the calming herbs we refer to as herbal seda- tives, hop is truly sedative in nature. It works as a mild but reliable nervous sys- tem depressant and hypnotic, whereas most other calming herbs work more as muscle relaxants. Provided it is used with prudence and respect, hop serves as an excellent general-purpose calming agent in cases of acute anxiety such as the dreaded trip to the groomer or a long horse-trailer ride on the interstate. Provided the animals accept the bitter flavor, a handful or two of the fresh or Humulus lupulus dried strobiles can be fed to horses, lla- mas, mules, or other herbivores just before or during an emotional crisis. A few drops of the tea or tincture can be fed to dogs and cats. Hop is also good for separation anxi- ety and for episodes of hyperexcitability that occur subsequent to traumatic events such as intermittent episodes of insomnia, whining, and restlessness that haunt an adopted pet who is recovering from physical or emotional abuse. Giving 10–20 drops added to each quart of the animal’s drinking water usually serves this purpose well. Hop is also good for helping an animal to relax in the pres- ence of physical pain, especially when hop is combined with valerian. While hop does not lend appreciable painkilling activities, it does assist the animal in dealing with pain naturally. (Animals are much better at this than we are.) Giving 1⁄8 teaspoon for each 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, no more than three times daily, usually suffices for pain or acute anxiety problems. While hop may help to relieve the severity of pain or an emotional crisis, it is important to remember that it cannot treat the underlying causes of behavioral disorders. Hyperactivity and excitability may be symptoms of a nutritional defi- ciency, a metabolic imbalance, an infec- tion, or hyperthyroidism. Look deep into your animal’s crisis from as many per- spectives as you can. Even if hop seems to be solving the problem, it may be only masking the symptoms of a serious disease. Animal studies have confirmed that the humulone and lupulone con- stituents in hop are active against many forms of gram-positive bacteria as well as some of the troublesome fungi, including Candida spp. Human studies have also shown promising results from the use of hop in treating gallbladder inflammation and urinary incontinence. In the incontinence study, 772 of 915 human patients who received a formula containing hop, uva ursi, and vitamin E experienced excellent results. Availability: Dried hop is available through herb retailers or wherever beer- making supplies are sold. Avoid the com- pressed pellets or strobiles and the con- centrated hop syrups used for brewing. What you want is the whole dried stro- biles. The compressed pellets and syrups are concentrated and may cause a serious toxic reaction in your animal. Ideally, of course, you should grow your own hop. Propagation and Harvest: Hop vines are easy to grow, cold hardy, and attrac- tive when trained to climb a trellis or gar- den archway. The plants need moist, rich soil and full sun in order to thrive and bloom. Plants and root cuttings are avail- able through nurseries. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For pain and posttraumatic irritability, hop com- bines especially well with valerian. If the pain is attributable to nerve trauma or dysfunction, consider skullcap, oatstraw, or Saint-John’s-wort as possible adjuncts or alternatives. For anxiety and restless- ness characterized by trembling or hyperexcitability to touch or a sudden sound (the animal jumps when sur- prised), hop can be combined with skull- cap or passionflower. Cautions and Comments: In 1998, the National Animal Poison Control Center had recorded eight instances of dogs dying after eating hops that had been used and discarded during the process of brewing beer. All of these dogs succumbed to malignant hyper- thermia—an acute, uncontrollable fever the first symptom of which is heavy Herbs for Pets 134 h Materia Medica 135 h panting, followed by rapid heartbeat and a rapid and continued rise in body temperature. Seven of the dogs were greyhounds, and it appears that this breed is especially susceptible to hyper- thermia from eating discarded hops. It also should be noted that the deaths of these dogs were from the ingestion of the spent (postbrewing) hops used in making beer, not from the medicinal- quality hops used in making tinctures. The problem appears to stem from three common denominators: • The chemistry of spent hops or the manner by which they are metabo- lized by greyhounds may be quite dif- ferent from the manner in which fresh or dried strobiles are processed by the same animals. It is evident that the chemical and biochemical rela- tionships among hops, malt syrup, various sugars, and other elements of beer-making may be responsible for the ultimate results and should be investigated. Heat raises yet another question—the process of boiling the herb is likely to change the chemistry of hop and the entire beer-making combination. • The hops used may have been com- pressed and therefore would have been concentrated. • Although we still do not know why, it appears that greyhounds are especial- ly predisposed to this problem, and therefore they should never be fed hops. In light of this problem, a subsequent study was conducted and published in The Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association. The study found that all of the greyhounds examined in an emergency clinic for the disorder had ingested approximately 250 milliliters of spent hops each—that’s about one cup. Spent brewing hops are sweet and tasty, making them a target for gluttony and toxic excess. Despite the fact that there have been no additional reports of hops- related hyperthermia in dogs ten years later, caution dictates that it is best to limit your dogs’ access to spent home- brew hops, especially if your pet is a greyhound. Limit your use of hops to small quantities of a high-quality formu- lation designed for animals, or use unadulterated fresh or dried hops with moderation. HORSETAIL Equisetum arvense Horsetail Family Appearance: The horsetail family is generally divided into three groups: (1) annual varieties that produce separate and distinctly different fertile and sterile stems, (2) annuals that produce sterile and fertile stems that are similar in appearance, and (3) evergreen perenni- als that produce fertile and sterile stems that are alike. Despite these variances, the entire family shares fundamentally similar characteristics: hollow, distinc- tively grooved and jointed stems and dark, scalelike leaves that appear as sheaths surrounding the stems at the joints. In early spring, Equisetum arvense produces a small 3- to 12-inch fertile stem that lacks chlorophyll (the con- stituent that makes plants green). This stem dies back as its larger green, sterile counterpart matures. The subsequent, 6- inch to 2-foot-tall sterile stems have whorled branches that resemble green bottlebrushes. Equisetum hyemale is much larger (up to 5 feet tall) and lacks any branching characteristics. It looks like a prehistoric cross between minia- ture bamboo and an asparagus spear. Both species are often seen growing side by side. Habitat and Range: Lakeshores, stream banks, and other wet areas, up into alpine elevations throughout North America. Horsetails often represent the primary ground cover in shady wet thickets. Cycle and Bloom Season: The green sterile plants emerge in spring. Perennial varieties remain green and usable throughout the year; annual varieties die back in late fall. Parts Used: All aerial parts Primary Medicinal Activities: Diu- retic, astringent, stops bleeding, tonic Strongest Affinities: Musculoskeletal system, skin, and hair Preparation: Tincture or decoction for internal uses; a poultice for external compresses Common Uses: Horsetail contains a vast array of synergistic chemical com- pounds that all contribute to myriad medicinal uses, but most notable is its usefulness in healing bone and connec- tive tissue injuries. Most of horsetail’s regenerative actions in the musculoskeletal system can be attributed to its remarkable con- tent of bioactive silicon. In the body, sili- con is a fundamental starting point, or matrix, for the formation of bone, carti- lage, skin, and other connective tissues, including those of the aorta and trachea. Silicon is perhaps the most common ele- ment on earth. In fact, most of the sand on our planet is composed largely of sili- con but not in a form that can be absorbed and used by the body. The sil- icon contained in horsetail is unique in that it is in a form that can be metabo- lized for tissue repair and development. For you and your companion, horse- tail can help speed recovery from joint and bone injuries, including postsurgical trauma. For internal use, a decoction or tincture preparation is needed. Horsetail is poorly water soluble and is abrasive, so unless it is put into a form that the body can easily absorb, it may cause irritation to the urinary tract and kidneys. To make a decoction, take a large handful of the dried herb and place it into a nonmetallic cooking vessel (to avoid picking up metallic residues). Add a 1⁄2 tea- spoon of sugar and enough water to barely cover the herb. The sugar helps to extract the silicon constituents and makes a more palatable finished product. Simmer the mixture over low heat for about twenty minutes or until the water has turned dark green. Strain through a fine cloth and allow to cool. The clarified decoction can be added directly to your companion’s food—1 tablespoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight daily, five days a week. Horsetail tincture can be used the same way but at a smaller dosage of 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of body weight. Horsetail is also useful for a variety of urinary tract problems, particularly those that involve bleeding or an accumulation of superfluous tissue in the urinary tract. The hemolytic and antimicrobial proper- ties of horsetail make it beneficial for uri- nary tract infections that involve minor bleeding from the bladder or urethra. To help avoid urinary tract irritation during long-term use (more than ten days), it’s a good idea to use horsetail in conjunc- tion with soothing, protecting, and lubri- cating herbs such as marshmallow, plan- tain, or chickweed. Marshmallow is our first choice because it adds excellent antimicrobial properties to the therapeu- tic effort. There is evidence to support claims that horsetail may help prevent bone Herbs for Pets 136 h Materia Medica 137 h degeneration, skin and coat disorders, and even senility in older animals. Scientific studies have concluded that as a body ages, silicon levels in the circulatory system and skin decrease, which in turn leads to tissue degeneration and a dimin- ished capacity to form new tissue. Other studies suggest that horsetail may be use- ful in preventing certain forms of senility and degenerative bone disease, namely those directly related to the balance between silicon and aluminum in the body. In theory, these ailments may result from a toxic excess of aluminum, a condi- tion normally counteracted by the pres- ence of silicic acid, silicon, and other vital compounds that are contained in horse- tail. In other words, dietary supplementa- tion with horsetail may help maintain a healthful balance of silicon in the bodies of aging animals. See your holistic veteri- narian to ascertain if and how much horsetail is suitable for your companion. Availability: A common plant through- out most of the world. The dried herb and tincture are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: For medi- cine of optimum quality, harvest E. arvense in mid– to late spring while the leaves of the bottlebrush-like plant still point skyward. Later, as the leaves spread horizontally, they become less water sol- uble and therefore do not make as good a medicine. Clip the plants just above ground level, and spread them out on a piece of newspaper to dry thoroughly before use. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Combines well with marshmallow, cleavers, plantain, chickweed, corn silk, or couch grass for urinary tract problems. To help in the healing of bone and connective tissue injuries, horsetail tincture combines well with comfrey or nettle and serves as an excellent adjunct to glucosamine and chondroiton sulfate supplements. For nervous system support in older animals, horsetail serves as an excellent adjunct to hawthorn and ginkgo. Cautions and Comments: Do not use horsetail in cases of hypertension or car- diac disease. Horsetail may cause breast milk to change flavor during lactation. If there is a history of silicate stones of the urinary system, caution should be used. Do not gather this plant from areas that are downstream of commercial farming activities as it may contain inorganic nitrates that are metabolized into abnor- mal nicotine-like alkaloids. Livestock have reportedly been poisoned by eating large quantities of horsetail, possibly due to alkaloid interfering with either the production or use of vitamin B1. Equisetum arvense JUNIPER Juniperus spp. Cypress Family Appearance: There are over 130 species of juniper worldwide; about 26 of these species are native to North America. The berries of all are useful, but Juniperus com- munis (common juniper) has a reputation among herbalists and wild food epicure- ans as having the berries with the strongest medicine. Species of this large genus of ever- greens are differentiated by their size (trees or low-growing shrubs) and the specific characteristics of their leaves (needlelike or scalelike). All junipers can be easily identified by their foliage and cones (commonly called juniper berries), which have a strong and distinctive gin- like aroma. Habitat and Range: Common juniper is generally a mountain shrub that can be found on rocky hillsides and forest clearings up to about 10,000 feet in ele- vation. Juniper is widespread from Alaska to California and throughout much of temperate North America. The afore- mentioned tree varieties are high-desert dwellers of eastern California, Nevada, Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Arizona, and New Mexico. Cycle and Bloom Season: Evergreen, producing fruits that take two to three years to ripen Parts Used: Fruits (berries) and leaves (often called needles) Primary Medicinal Activities: Astrin- gent, diuretic, antimicrobial, strengthens kidney function, lowers blood sugar, tonic Strongest Affinities: Genitourinary system (including the kidneys), skin Preparation: Decoction of the leaves or berries, tincture (berries), or whole (dried or fresh) berries can be fed direct- ly or as a food additive. Common Uses: Recent scientific studies conducted at the College of Medicine at Taiwan National University and the Universidad de Granada in Spain have shown that juniper offers new hope in the treatment of diabetes and cardiovas- cular disease. In the study conducted in Spain, a decoction of ripe juniper berries was administered to both diabetic and healthy rats. In both test groups, the decoction was found to lower blood glu- cose levels by increasing glucose uptake in the diaphragm, while at the same time increasing the amount of insulin released from the pancreas. The result was a lower mortality rate in animals with insulin-dependent diabetes and new hope for those with other forms of diabetes. In the study conducted in Taiwan, a compound derivative of the berries called 14 acetoxycedrol was found to have anticoagulant effects in the blood and a relaxing action on vas- cular tissues, actions that should prove useful in reducing the risk of cardiovas- cular disease in humans and other ani- mals. In the minds of modern herbalists, these wonderful new discoveries only add to juniper’s long history as a heal- ing ally. During the black plague, many European physicians carried three or four juniper berries in their mouth at all times to prevent infection. Medical instruments were soaked in a disinfect- ing decoction of the berries. Native Americans used every part of the shrub for a variety of ailments ranging from sore throats to dandruff, sometimes bathing their horses in a root tea to improve their coats. In fact, juniper has been used as a food and medicine for Herbs for Pets 138 j Materia Medica 139 j thousands of years by cultures the world over and remains an ingredient in sever- al mainstream over-the-counter diuretic and laxative remedies today. The berries are a valuable culinary commodity as well, being used as the primary flavoring agent in gin and as a rather expensive seasoning for gourmet dishes. (We like to use them in place of bay leaves in chili and wild-food dishes.) Modern-day herbalists use juniper to treat edema and arthritis as well as acute and severe cystitis and other infections of the urinary tract. Juniper is also known to stimulate kidney function by increasing the rate of glomerulus filtration, the process by which the kidneys filter out impurities and cleanse the blood. In lay terms, juniper increases urine production and waste elimination. This effect is due to an irritant action attributable to juniper’s generous content of volatile oils, especially one called terpineol. Because of these irritating effects, juniper should never be used in animals with preexisting kidney problems, nor should it be used over long periods of time. Also, juniper is known to have a vasodi- lating action in the uterus and was once used to promote menstrual flow; there- fore, it should never be used in pregnant animals. Fortunately, all of this sounds more ominous than it really is since many stimulatory herbs work because of their abilities to selectively irritate the body. When used over a very short peri- od in the correct dosages, and in non- pregnant animals with healthy kidneys, juniper can safely increase renal circula- tion and boost overall kidney function. The antiseptic and astringent proper- ties of the berries or leaves may be useful in relieving itchiness and infections of the skin when applied topically in the form of a cooled dilute rinse. Because the plant is not water soluble, you will first need to make a simple decoction (see chapter 1). After the decoction has cooled, dilute it with enough cold water to give it the appearance of a weak tea (you should be able to see through a clear 8-ounce glass of the liquid. Now you can pour the liquid over your dog (and as long as you don’t mind a few claw scratches, your cat) until the animal is thoroughly soaked. Avoid getting any into your animal’s eyes. Before using juniper in a rinse, be sure that the decoction is well diluted. While problems seldom occur when using juniper as a skin rinse, the volatile oils in the plant can be irritating if the solution is too strong, especially if your animal has sensitive skin to start with. (By the way, this applies to peppermint, penny- royal, and eucalyptus rinses as well.) After you rinse your pet, she will smell like a conifer forest on a warm spring day! Juniperis communis Availability: Juniper berries are avail- able at the supermarket, but they are much too expensive considering how common the shrubs are. Juniper leaf and berry extracts are available through herb retailers. Several shrub and small tree varieties are available from nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Several species of juniper have been domesticat- ed and are available at your local nursery. Juniperus communis is frequently used as a low-growing landscaping shrub and is an excellent choice for walkway borders and flower beds. Junipers are easy to grow but tend to grow slowly. Once established, they are cold hardy (espe- cially J. communis), drought tolerant, and they require minimal maintenance. Soil quality is of little concern to these plants, but they do appreciate at least a slightly acidic pH level, so if necessary, amend your soil with some redwood compost. When you visit the nursery, remember that only the female plants bear the sought-after berries and that you will need at least two plants (a male and a female) to produce fruit. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For inflam- mations of the urinary tract, consider couch grass, gravelroot, corn silk, plan- tain, and uva ursi before using juniper. Marshmallow adds soothing and lubricat- ing protection when added to juniper. For urinary tract infections, look at echinacea, sage, thyme, and Oregon grape as alter- natives or adjuncts. For treating fleabites and other skin irritations, juniper com- bines well in a skin rinse with calendula, chamomile, or peppermint (or for that matter, any kind of mint). Cautions and Comments: Do not use juniper internally in animals with preexisting kidney disease or in preg- nant or lactating animals. The key rule with juniper is one that applies to all herbal remedies: Use with caution and always in moderation. And remember, what may be deemed excessive for one animal may be inadequate for another. Proper use of juniper is entirely depend- ent upon an accurate assessment of your companion’s specific needs and medical condition. Please see your holistic veterinarian first. LAVENDER Lavandula angustifolia Mint Family Appearance: With its delicate spikelike flowers, narrow silvery leaves, and sweet fragrance, lavender is a beautiful adorn- ment to any garden. There are several cultivars of Lavandula; the one most commonly found in nurseries is English lavender (L. angustifolia). Habitat and Range: A Mediterranean native that is in cultivation throughout much of the world Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in early to midsummer Parts Used: Flowers, leaves, and stems Primary Medicinal Activities: Elevates mood (antidepressive), antibacterial, astringent, analgesic, antispasmodic, tonic Strongest Affinities: Skin, nervous sys- tem, respiratory tract, joints Preparation: Diluted essential oil, tea, dried flower bunches, sachets Common Uses: The essential oil of lavender works wonders to calm a nerv- ous or excited animal. In depressed or aggressive animals, lavender can be used to lift spirits and adjust attitudes. In these Herbs for Pets 140 l Materia Medica 141 l applications, the oil is not applied to the animal itself but is used in aromatherapy. An open bottle of the oil is waved under the animal’s nostrils, or a few drops are put on a piece of cardboard that is placed near the animal’s bedding, under a car seat, or on the outside of a travel carrier. The sweet aroma helps the ani- mal (and her human guardian) to relax during an otherwise restless experience. Oftentimes the effects are instantaneous. A small sachet bag can be filled with lavender flowers and placed near the ani- mal for the same (but less reliable) effect. A few drops of the essential oil can be added to some water and placed in a vaporizer (or a potpourri simmering pot) and used to treat coughs and respiratory infections. When emitted near the ani- mal in a closed room, the vapor helps to open respiratory passages and inhibit bacterial reproduction in the lungs. For joint inflammation, stiffness, or pain, 10 drops of the essential oil can be added to 1 ounce of apricot kernel or almond oil (these absorb into skin more readily than olive oil). The mixture then can be liberally massaged into the affect- ed area to bring relief. The oil mixture is also useful for insect bites and stings and is an excellent addition to first aid salves. A good tick repellent oil for dogs can be made from 300 milliliters of olive oil or other oil, 500 milliliters of essential oil of terebinth, 100 milliliters of Saint- John’s-wort–infused oil, and 100 milli- liters of essential oil of lavender. This recipe makes about a liter of the oil. It can be massaged on affected areas to help ticks drop off. As a preventative, it can be massaged on areas of the dog that are most likely to come into contact with ticks. Avoid using essential oils on or around cats. A tea of the fresh or dried flowers, leaves, and stems can be used as an external skin rinse for relief from pain and itching caused by seborrhea, con- tact dermatitis, or fleabites. The rinse helps to fight bacterial infection as well. Be sure the rinse is well diluted—the water should be slightly tinted but still fragrant. Availability: The essential oil can be purchased through natural product retailers, as can the dried flowers. Plants are available through most nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Lavender is winter hardy, drought resistant, and easy to grow from transplants. Plants prefer well-drained, sandy soil with a pH between 6.4 and 8.3 (acidic soil should be amended with hydrated lime or soft rock phosphate). Alternatives and Adjuncts: For joint problems, lavender combines with Lavandula angustifolia yarrow, arnica, Saint-John’s-wort, or cayenne. For respiratory infections, try adding yarrow to a vaporizer. For calm- ing effects, lavender aromatherapy used in conjunction with an internal dose of passionflower, skullcap, valerian, or hop can be effective. Cautions and Comments: Although all parts of the dried or above-ground parts of this plant are generally safe when used in raw form or in simple teas, the highly concentrated essential oil of lavender can be very hard on the liver and kidneys. Therefore, it should not be ingested. Nor should the oil be used on the skin in undiluted form because it may cause irritation. Avoid using essen- tial oils on or around cats. LICORICE Glycyrrhiza glabra Pea Family and G. lepidota Appearance: Licorice is a member of the pea family and can be characterized by its greenish white, pealike axillary flowers; pinnately divided pealike leaves (divided into pairs of lance-shaped leaflets); and inclination to climb and tan- gle among other plants. At first glance, licorice looks like any one of thousands of wild legumes. Fortunately, our wild American licorice (Glycyrrhiza lepidota) has characteristics that make it unique and easy to identify. It is a large legume (3–7 feet tall when mature) with an exceptionally stout reddish main stem. But even more distinguishing are its 1⁄2- inch-long, tightly clustered seed pods, which are covered with conspicuous hooked spines. No other legume in North America presents this characteristic. Habitat and Range: The vast majority of licorice root sold in North America is G. glabra, a native of southeast Europe that probably came over with the first Anglo settlers. Of the twenty-five or so species that can be found worldwide, we have only one native species in North America: G. lepidota. All other species have been naturalized from Europe or Asia. American licorice occurs sporadical- ly across North America, and like its alien relatives that in many areas have escaped cultivation, it is generally to be found in moist ravines, in roadside ditches, in waste areas, and along the banks of irri- gation canals where soils are rich and deep. Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial or short-lived perennial that reproduces by seed. Blooms in midsummer. Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Expect- orant; helps with blood cleansing; lubri- cates, soothes, and protects mucous membranes; anti-inflammatory; antiviral; adrenal stimulant; mild laxative; immunos- timulant. Strongest Affinities: Respiratory, digestive, and endocrine systems Preparation: Fresh or dried chopped root, tea, tincture Common Uses: Numerous studies have confirmed that licorice is an effective and fast-acting anti-inflammatory agent. In fact, many herbalists regard it as nature’s answer to hydrocortisone and claim that it potentiates the effectiveness of other herbs when added to compound formu- las. All of this is primarily attributable to licorice’s content of glycyrrhizin, a com- pound with a chemical structure similar to that of the corticosteroids that are naturally released by the body’s adrenal Herbs for Pets 142 l Materia Medica 143 l glands. Glycyrrhizin effectively stimulates the adrenals into action and is especially useful for treating Addison’s disease. Licorice provides anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, immunostimulant, and corticosteroid-like actions—thus helping to relieve pain, itching, and inflamma- tion without completely bypassing the body’s normal anti-inflammatory func- tions and without seriously compromis- ing the immune system. This makes licorice useful for a wide variety of inflammatory diseases. In a study where arthritis was induced in rats through injections of formaldehyde, a by-product of glycyrrhizin called glycyrrhetinic acid was produced in the body and was shown to have obvious antiarthritic actions that were comparable to those of hydrocortisone. Glycyrrhizin has also been shown to potentiate the effects of cortisone-like drugs in the body, which makes licorice a useful adjunct in hydro- cortisone therapies. The theory here is that the potentiating effect of licorice allows for lower drug dosages without compromising therapeutic effectiveness. Used in this capacity, licorice should help reduce the debilitating side effects of steroid drugs in long-term therapies and may also assure safe withdrawal when the patient is weaned off of the steroids. The anti-inflammatory properties of licorice root are also apparent when the herb is topically applied. Licorice tea, salve, or oil infusion can be used to relieve the uncomfortable symptoms of various skin disorders such as psoriasis, eczema, contact dermatitis, and flea allergies. Used in this capacity, licorice provides a degree of relief during long- term holistic therapies, including a detoxification and allergy therapy con- sisting of internal doses of burdock, dandelion, alfalfa, or other alterative herbs. In this example, the animal receives relief from suffering, but the underlying metabolic causes are also addressed through tonification of the involved body systems. To make a simple oil infusion, all you need is some chopped dried licorice root (available at any good herb retailer) and some olive oil. Put the root into a glass jar and cover it with enough oil to leave a 1⁄2-inch layer of liquid above the herb. Cover the jar tightly, put it in a warm (55–75° F) place, away from sunlight, and let it sit for one month. After a month, strain the oil through a sieve, then squeeze what you can from the herb by wrapping it in unbleached muslin or cheesecloth. You’ll have a sweet-tasting licorice oil that keeps for several months if refrigerated. Use it top- ically as needed, but expect your com- panion to lick it off—it tastes like candy. In addition to its powerful anti- inflammatory actions, licorice root is Glycyrrhiza lepidota beneficial in the treatment and preven- tion of many forms of liver disease. Over the past two decades, medical researchers in China and Japan have found (through animal studies) that extracts of licorice root are useful in the treatment of chronic and chemically induced hepatitis and that the herb has liver-protectant qualities similar to those offered by the popular liver herb milk thistle (Silybum marianum). However, the mechanisms by which licorice root works in the liver are quite different from those of milk thistle. While milk thistle has been shown to resist liver cell destruction largely through protection of the cell walls and by antioxidant actions, licorice works through a broad- er set of effects. In addition to a protec- tant action that glycyrrhizin has upon the liver cells, licorice also enhances interferon and T cell production, two natural actions that are critical to liver repair and general resistance to disease. In Chinese medicine, licorice is com- monly used as a liver detoxifier in the treatment of obstructive jaundice. And in several studies, licorice has been shown to benefit animals suffering from liver damage due to absorbed or ingest- ed toxins such as carbon tetrachloride. In a recent study, the root of G. uralensis (an Asian species of licorice) was found to have a potentiating effect on the reticuloendothelial system, the body’s first line of defense against infec- tion. In essence, the reticuloendothelial system is composed of specialized cells whose jobs are to seek out and eliminate invading microbes and dead blood cells, and licorice helps to stimulate these little bloodstream warriors into action. Licorice is also an excellent demul- cent, anti-inflammatory, and expecto- rant for the gastrointestinal and upper respiratory tracts. It is especially good for healing ulceration of the stomach and reducing the gastric acid secretions that often contribute to the severity of ulcers. For bronchitis, licorice works well at reducing inflammation while adding antiviral, antibacterial, and soothing demulcent actions to any variety of other respiratory herbs that may be employed such as mullein, coltsfoot, and grindelia. When giving licorice to your animal, you are likely to find the best results when using liquid extracts (tinctures). Feeding dried chopped roots to herbi- vores is fine if tolerated, but dogs and cats have short digestive tracts that may not absorb the active constituents quick- ly and completely. Herb tinctures are free-form medicines: their active compo- nents are readily available and quickly assimilated early in the digestive process. This means that less of the active materi- al is lost during digestion and more ends up in your cat instead of in her litter box. Dosage is entirely dependent upon indi- vidual needs and circumstances and should be determined by a trained prac- titioner, but 12–20 drops per 20 pounds of body weight, two times daily, of low- alcohol licorice extract is a conservative starting point for dogs, cats, and other small animals. Horses can be fed the equivalent of up to 1 ounce (10–30 grams) of the dried root, or about 1⁄4 ounce of the tincture daily. You can triple the liquid dosages if you are using a cooled tea (1 teaspoon of the root to 1 cup of water). Availability: Licorice can be planted from root cuttings or seed, both of which are available from nursery cata- logs that specialize in herbs. Propagation and Harvest: To grow licorice in your garden, plant it in moist, deep, well-drained, nutrient-rich sandy loam with a neutral to slightly alkaline pH. Although it is adaptable to various Herbs for Pets 144 l Materia Medica 145 m climates, licorice does best in areas with long, warm growing seasons. (If you can’t meet these demands, don’t worry. This plant survives just about anywhere.) Dig the perennial roots during the fall of their third or fourth year of growth— younger roots won’t be as potent. After digging, cut the roots into small pieces and dry them on newspaper, away from sunlight. The completely dried roots keep for one to two years if properly stored in plastic bags in a cool, dry, dark place. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For stom- ach ulcers and other gastric disorders that are secondary to bacterial or para- sitic infection, licorice combines with Oregon grape. To provide secondary anti-inflammatory relief in the gastroin- testinal or urinary tract, consider corn silk, couch grass, or uva ursi as adjuncts. For respiratory problems, consider ele- campane, coltsfoot, grindelia, mullein, slippery elm, plantain, marshmallow, and wild cherry bark as possible substi- tutes or adjuncts. For liver problems, look toward milk thistle, dandelion root, Oregon grape, red clover, and burdock as possible adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: As for all herbal medicines, the primary rule is moderation and insight when using licorice. Throughout its long history as a medicine, licorice has been the subject of controversies. When used in large, high- ly concentrated doses, especially over long periods, several hydrocortisone-like side effects may occur: water retention, hypertension, loss of potassium, sodium retention, and other symptoms of adre- nal hyperactivity. In human studies, the large majority of these side effects have been observed following the excessive consumption of European licorice candy, which is made from a concentrated pressed extract of the root. (American- produced licorice candy contains ab- solutely no real licorice but instead an artificial flavoring or the extracts of other plants that taste similar.) Most herbalists and practitioners agree that the risks of adverse side effects from licorice are lim- ited to those who abuse it. We, however, have never seen a case of licorice- induced toxicity. Nevertheless, licorice should not be used with reckless aban- don or in normal doses for periods exceeding two weeks without the in- struction of a qualified practitioner. If a licorice therapy does exceed two weeks, then the treated animal’s diet should be adjusted to accommodate increased needs for potassium and to eliminate excess sodium. Dandelion leaf is well indicated here because it works as an effective diuretic to prevent water reten- tion while providing an excellent source of supplemental potassium. Animals with preexisting cardiovascular conditions should not be given licorice without pro- fessional guidance. Licorice may temporarily elevate blood sugar levels and should be used with caution in diabetic animals. It has also been shown to have estrogenic properties that may affect uterine func- tions. Therefore, licorice should be used with caution in pregnant or nursing animals. MARSHMALLOW Althea officinalis Mallow Family Appearance: Marshmallow is a stout plant that may grow as high as 7 feet. It has alternate 3- to 5-lobed leaves and showy 2- to 3-inch flowers that range in color from white to pale pink. The entire plant is covered with fine, soft hairs, a trait that gives the foliage a dusty appearance. Habitat and Range: A native of west- ern and central Europe, marshmallow has become naturalized in the U.S., where it grows in marshes and moist meadows throughout the New England states. It has become a popular garden herb throughout the world and is easy to grow. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from late June through September Parts Used: Primarily the root. The foliage is useful, too, but does not make as good a medicine. Primary Medicinal Activities: Soothes and lubricates internal tissues, soothes skin, antimicrobial, lowers blood sugar, immunostimulant. Strongest Affinities: Skin and respira- tory, digestive, and urinary tracts Preparation: Tea, low-alcohol tincture, fresh or dried chopped root Common Uses: Marshmallow has a long history as a medicine. The word Althea is derived from the ancient Greek word altheo, meaning “to cure.” With few exceptions, marshmallow is among the safest and most versatile herbs for animals. The root of the mature plant contains up to 35 percent mucilage. This makes marshmallow useful in situa- tions that involve surface irritation of the skin or internal mucous mem- branes. It is particularly helpful for uri- nary tract inflammations compounded by the presence of gravel in the urine (urinary calculus) and in digestive disor- ders where ulceration or infection is fur- ther aggravated by the presence of food or other solids. In these cases, marshmallow provides a soothing, lubricating, protective barrier between mucous membranes and substances that contribute to the irritation. Marshmallow also soothes upper respi- ratory irritations that are secondary to a dry, raspy cough. Used on the surface of the body, marshmallow brings relief to insect bites, stings, abscesses, and inflammations that are secondary to injury or infection. In addition to the soothing nature of mucilage, marshmal- low has antimicrobial and immune- stimulating properties. In animal stud- ies, it has been shown to be active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, and Staphylococcus aureus, bacterial infections that are commonly seen in the digestive tract, urinary tract, skin, and ears of dogs, cats, horses, ferrets, and other animals. A dab of marshmallow tincture also serves as an excellent antimicrobial lubricant for a rectal thermometer. For internal use of marshmallow root, a tea or low-alcohol tincture is usually the best choice. The dried or fresh root may be a better option for problems such as colitis that are deep within the digestive system. This is because marshmallow’s mucilage is highly water soluble and may not reach the lower end of the digestive tract unless it is carried there in a solid con- tainer, namely the chopped or ground root. If you opt to use a tincture of this herb, make sure that it doesn’t contain more than 20 percent alcohol (actually, none is needed). The mucilage con- stituents aren’t taken up well in alcohol, and if too much is used in the tincture- making process, the end product will cause nausea when ingested. We like glycerin tinctures of this herb, not only for this reason but because the glycerin itself adds soothing, protective qualities to the medicine. Marshmallow glycerite Herbs for Pets 146 m Materia Medica 147 m can be squirted directly into an animal’s mouth—about 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, three times daily or as needed. Alternatively, a tea can be made by steeping a teaspoon of the dried chopped root (or 2 teaspoons of fresh root) in 8 ounces of very hot water. Stir the tea frequently until it has cooled to lukewarm. You should be able to feel the slippery, oily nature of the mucilage when you rub a few drops of the tea between your thumb and index finger. If not, add more marshmallow root. One teaspoon of the tea is a good start- ing dose for dogs. Cats usually benefit from a 1⁄2 teaspoon. It’s also good for lubricating and expelling fur balls. For lower gastrointestinal problems or to help relieve constipation (in a manner similar to that of psyllium husks), the dried powdered root can be added to an animal’s food at a rate of a 1⁄2 tea- spoon for each pound of food fed (1⁄4 teaspoon for cats and other small ani- mals), once or twice daily. For horses, 1 ounce of the powdered root can be added to feed each day to aid in cases of cystitis, colitis, or chronic spasmodic colic. For problems that are close to the rectum such as a swollen anal gland irri- tated by bowel movements, a small gel capsule might be necessary to carry the root powder through the digestive tract to the problem area. Another option is to administer a small amount of the cooled tea or glycerite as a rectal sup- pository using a soft plastic pipette or ear syringe. Marshmallow has been shown to cause hypoglycemic activity in animals. Although more research is warranted, marshmallow might be useful in treat- ing certain forms of diabetes. See your holistic veterinarian before trying it in this capacity. Availability: Marshmallow plants are available through most nurseries. Marshmallow root and various prepara- tions are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Marsh- mallow is easy to grow. It can be propa- gated by seed, root cuttings, or trans- plants. Although it requires ample water, it’s not picky about soil and is hardy and drought tolerant once established. Planting should occur in early spring. The roots are ready for harvest anytime dur- ing their third year of growth and every year thereafter. You do not have to kill your plant to dig up some of the root— simply divide what you need from the existing root system, and give the plant extra water until the roots regenerate. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For urinary problems, marshmallow combines well Althea officinalis with couch grass, horsetail, uva ursi, corn silk, echinacea, ginkgo, or any of the diuretic herbs. For coughs and upper res- piratory irritations, marshmallow com- bines with mullein, coltsfoot, elecampane, or grindelia. For digestive problems, con- sider combining licorice, chamomile, cal- endula, cleavers, fennel, dill, or any variety of mint with marshmallow. In horses, a combination of marshmallow, valerian, slippery elm, and licorice is good for a spastic colon. For infections or irritations of the skin of most animals, calendula, mullein flower, garlic, comfrey, and aloe are all complemented by marshmallow. Cautions and Comments: Marsh- mallow has long been used as a food plant, and its safety is substantiated by many years of use in both humans and animals. It is known to lower blood sugar levels, however, and therefore should be used with caution in hypoglycemic ani- mals. It may also retard the intestinal absorption of some drugs—at least for short periods, until the thick, viscous mucilage can be broken down in the digestive tract. MILK THISTLE Silybum marianum Sunflower Family Appearance: From a distance, milk this- tle looks very much like any other thistle: deeply lobed, often spiny leaves; stout, often spiny stems; and large, up to 2 inch- es wide, white to purple disk flowers, each resembling a miniature artichoke (anoth- er thistle). Closer inspection of milk thistle reveals a weblike pattern on the surfaces of the leaves, a characteristic that sets it apart from its many cousins. Milk thistle may grow to 7 feet tall. Habitat and Range: A native of the Mediterranean region of Europe, milk thistle has become naturalized in many portions of North America. In many areas it has earned the reputation of being an invasive weed. Milk thistle is cultivated throughout much of the world for its medicinal seeds. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or biennial that blooms June through July Parts Used: Ripe seeds Primary Medicinal Activities: Protects and strengthens the liver Strongest Affinities: Liver Preparation: Alcohol tincture or a stan- dardized powder extract (usually con- tained in gel capsules). A high concen- tration of alcohol is required to extract the active constituents from the ground seeds. Be skeptical of milk thistle tincture products whose labels claim low or no alcohol. Common Uses: Milk thistle has a long ethno-botanical history that gives it stature as much more than a liver herb. It has been used to treat everything from cancer to poor milk production in nursing mothers, but it is most effective in protecting and regenerating the liver. Most of milk thistle’s usefulness can be attributed to its silymarin con- stituent. Dozens of studies have con- firmed that silymarin and its related compounds support and protect the liver during crisis by accelerating the rate of protein synthesis and stimulat- ing production of new cells to replace damaged ones. These compounds work as powerful antioxidants and strengthen liver cell resistance to toxic compounds, while at the same time Herbs for Pets 148 m Materia Medica 149 m stimulating cellular reproduction. Much of what we know about these activities stems from the discovery that silymarin can be used to antidote amanita (death cap) mushroom poi- soning. When intravenous silymarin is administered within twenty-four to forty-eight hours of ingestion, toxic compounds that would normally destroy liver cells are prevented from penetrating the cell walls, and liver damage is greatly minimized. Scientific research has also con- firmed that milk thistle protects the liver from the harmful effects of various other toxins. Specifically, milk thistle protects an animal’s liver during a toxicity-related crisis (such as exposure to toxic chemicals or potentially harm- ful drug therapies) and helps the animal through a liver damage or disease crisis. It can be used in dogs, cats, horses, goats, ferrets, and rodents to aid in liver or kidney damage, hepatitis, jaundice, leptospirosis, and parvovirus recovery. Milk thistle may prove helpful for treat- ing liver tumors, cancers, and skin prob- lems that are secondary to liver disease. Animals who have been on allopathic drugs, heartworm medication, de- wormers, vaccinations, anticonvulsive drugs, or chemotherapy might benefit from this herb as well. Milk thistle can also help block the potential liver- damaging effects of anesthesia and is often used both before and after sur- gery in Germany. Medical and biologi- cal studies support its use in reducing the toxic effect of heavy metals if administered soon enough. Despite much of the publicity that has been generated about this “won- der herb,” milk thistle should not be used as a daily food supplement. Milk thistle is a medicine that is best reserved for situations in which the liver is already under abnormal stress. When used in absence of preexisting stress, milk thistle probably won’t do any harm, but on the other hand it might cause digestive disorders or it might impair other body-cleansing functions of the liver. Many herbalists believe that it can actually slow the metabolic functions of a healthy liver. In any case, milk thistle is unnecessary unless there is a real and present need, and its use as a dietary supplement constitutes waste. Alcohol tinctures are the best for administering milk thistle because they allow quick and complete absorption of silymarin into the body. But in cases in which severe liver damage might be compounded by alcohol, or in animals with alcohol hypersensitivity, a stan- dardized powder extract (formulated to contain 60–80 percent silymarin) might be a better choice. In cases in which stress on the liver is suspected Silybum marianum but not yet serious, the alcohol extract can be administered at a starting dose of 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Before feeding it to your animal, dilute each dose with an equal amount or more of water to make the tincture more palatable and to minimize the astringency and burning sensation of the alcohol. The tincture can then be added to the animal’s food. In any sus- pected case of liver disease, a holistic veterinarian should be consulted before proceeding with the use of milk thistle or any other herb. Availability: Available in various formu- lations through herb retailers Propagation and Harvest: Milk this- tle is easy to grow, but the small yield of seeds per plant makes cultivation a pointless endeavor unless you own a farm rather than just a garden. Harvesting must be done when the seeds are completely ripe and dry but before they leave the plant with a gust of wind. In other words, leave the task to the people who farm it. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Licorice is another excellent liver-repairing herb that possesses a broader spectrum of medicinal activities than milk thistle. For mild to moderate liver disorders that are believed to be toxicity related and that are signified by chronic constipation, indigestion, or skin problems, milk thistle can be combined with dandelion, bur- dock, yellow dock, red clover, Oregon grape, or turmeric. Cautions and Comments: Milk thistle is a very safe herb. In studies that involve giving laboratory animals high doses of silymarin over long periods, the animals display no toxicity. MULLEIN Verbascum thapsus Figwort Family Appearance: This conspicuous plant is recognized during its first year of growth as a ground-hugging rosette of large, up to 12 inches long, broadly lance-shaped, profusely fuzzy leaves. During its second and final year of growth, mullein heads skyward with a stout central stalk that may exceed 6 feet in height. Numerous yellow flow- ers are then presented in a coblike clus- ter. There are several species of mullein to be found in North America. Verbascum thapsus is the most common and widespread. Habitat and Range: Mullein is a Eurasian import that has made itself at home in any variety of disturbed sites throughout North America. It is common to clear-cuts, burned areas, and partially developed lands in the West, where it often serves as an important earth regenerator, helping to regain biological balances and pre- vent erosion. Cycle and Bloom Season: A biennial that blooms throughout the summer Parts Used: Leaves, flower heads, roots (each part represents different medi- cines) Primary Medicinal Activities: Expec- torant; antimicrobial; antiviral; cough sup- pressant; lubricates, soothes, and protects mucous membranes; astringent Strongest Affinities: Respiratory and urinary tracts, skin, and ears Preparation: Tea, tincture, oil infusion, compress, poultice Herbs for Pets 150 m Materia Medica 151 m Common Uses: This wayside weed is extremely useful, providing safe and effective medicine for a wide variety of ailments. The leaves are well known for their ability to ease spasmodic coughs while reducing inflammation and in- creasing mucus production in the bronchi, making coughs more produc- tive and allowing sufferers to rest easier. These qualities combine with antimicro- bial and antiviral properties, making mullein an herb of choice in the treat- ment of canine tracheobronchitis (ken- nel cough) and various other forms of respiratory distress in animals. Scientific studies have shown that a synergy of compounds contained in mullein leaf actively inhibits reproduc- tion of herpes simplex virus (HSV). This activity, combined with the antitussive and expectorant qualities of the plant, might prove useful in treating canine herpes virus (CHV) and feline viral rhino- tracheitis (FVR). Although more study is needed to ascertain the effectiveness of mullein against HSV infections in ani- mals, the safety of this plant and its demonstrated ability to relieve many of the discomforts of these diseases justifies giving it a try. A strong leaf tea can be used (10 milliliters per 30 pounds of a dog’s body weight, twice daily; 5 milli- liters twice daily for cats), or a glycerin tincture can be given directly into the mouth (1–2 milliliters per 20 pounds of an animal’s weight, twice daily). Mullein leaf is also practical in the treatment of asthma, especially when it is combined with elecampane, grindelia, or lobelia. (Please see the Lobelia section in the “Supplemental Herb List” for cautions about this herb.) The large leaves of mullein also make an excellent antimicrobial and astringent poultice for minor wounds and insect bites. Just mash up a few fresh or dried leaves with some water and apply the poultice directly to the affected area. Mullein leaf is said to lower the acidity of urine, as well, making the herb useful in the treatment of various urinary disor- ders where urine pH levels are too low. The flowering tops of mullein have antimicrobial properties with a special affinity toward infections of the ears, including those caused by ear mites. (Note: Ear problems are a sign of chron- ic disease in an animal who is on a com- mercial diet.) The best way to use the flowers is in the form of an oil infusion. The flowers also contain rotenone and a synergy of other insecticidal compounds, making mullein effective in the fight against fleas and mange. Some herbalists maintain that a tinc- ture of the root can be used to treat uri- nary incontinence. Urinary incontinence can be due to estrogen or testosterone deficiencies, neurogenic dysfunction, anatomical abnormalities, or paradoxical Verbascum thapsus obstruction from urethral calculi or neo- plasia, so contact your holistic vet to find the cause before proceeding with the use of mullein root. Availability: An abundant weed in much of North America. The seeds are available through specialty seed catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: The leaves of mullein can be harvested anytime, pro- vided they look healthy. The flowers do not appear until the plants’ second year and should be plucked from the flower heads when they are wide open (we pre- fer to use them fresh). The first-year roots should be dug in fall, whereas the second- year roots should be dug in the spring, before the biennial plant begins to die. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For kennel cough and other respiratory problems, mullein leaf combines well with elecam- pane, grindelia, or horehound. For use in the ears, nothing compares to a combina- tion of garlic and mullein flower oil. Saint- John’s-wort oil and vitamin are also great adjuncts here. Other herbs to consider for urinary incontinence (alone or as adjuncts) include corn silk, uva ursi, couch grass, Saint-John’s-wort, and horsetail. Cautions and Comments: Keep mullein away from fish and amphibians. The rotenone contained in mullein is toxic to aquatic life. NETTLE Urtica dioica Nettle Family Appearance: Stinging nettle is an erect plant that may grow as high as 7 feet where conditions permit. It reproduces largely from its shallow horizontally creeping root system and is often found in dense patches. Its leaves are broadly lance-shaped with coarsely toothed mar- gins. Flowers are presented in inconspic- uous drooping clusters. Stems are cov- ered with fine stinging hairs. Young plants often emerge a reddish color, later turning green as they mature. Habitat and Range: Several species of nettle inhabit drainage ditches, stream banks, and other moist soils throughout North America and much of the Northern Hemisphere. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial, annual, or biennial (depending on species and climate) that blooms in early summer Parts Used: Leaves and stems of the preflowering plant and, to a lesser extent, the root Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutritive, antihistamine, astringent, tonic, helps with blood cleansing Strongest Affinities: Genitourinary tract, blood, skin, and eyes Preparation: Dried herb (directly fed), tea, poultice, tincture Common Uses: All species of Urtica cause an instantaneous contact dermati- tis that is characterized by tiny blisters and a burning sting. Fortunately, nettle’s unpleasant, self-initiated introduction is usually short lived, and those who can learn to accept nettle’s characteristics are bound to realize the precious gifts this somewhat obnoxious plant has to offer. Despite its downside, we recognize this plant as one of nature’s best nutraceuti- cals. Ironically, nettle is actually quite delicious, nutritious, and rich with heal- ing opportunities. Although gloves and a long-sleeved shirt must be worn when gathering the Herbs for Pets 152 n Materia Medica 153 n greens, complete drying or cooking neu- tralizes the plant’s antigenic proteins and formic acid compounds—the con- stituents responsible for the plant’s sting. These compounds break down quickly when exposed to air or heat, and when correctly prepared, the leafy greens of young nettle plants are delicious and contain a vast array of vitamins, miner- als, and nutrients. In fact, 100 grams of dried preflowering nettle plant contains up to 30.4 grams (30 percent by weight) of crude protein, 2,970 milligrams of cal- cium, 680 milligrams of phosphorus, 32.2 milligrams of iron, 650 milligrams of magnesium, 20.2 milligrams of beta- carotene, and 3,450 milligrams of potas- sium, along with vitamins A, C, D, and B complex—all in a highly palatable form that can be effectively assimilated into the body without adding excess stress upon the liver, kidneys, or digestive tract. Nettle therefore makes an excellent addi- tion to food for animals who need extra trace minerals and vitamins in their diet but not necessarily in huge, multivitamin doses. This applies to animals who are already on a natural diet or those who are sensitive to excessive vitamin or min- eral supplementation because of chronic digestive disorders, existing systemic toxicity, or urinary tract problems. The completely dried herb can be sprinkled directly onto the animals’ food—1⁄2 tea- spoon for each pound of food fed to dogs, or 1⁄3 teaspoon per meal for cats. Herbivores can be fed the dried greens in their usual diet, and many will relish net- tle as a special treat. In Sweden and Russia, where the problem of producing nutrient-rich feeds is compounded by a short growing season, winter-hardy net- tles are sometimes cultivated as fodder crops and then dried. For finicky pets who despise any- thing but what their humans are eating, try cooking the fresh young plants with enough water to cover them until they are soft and tender. The cooked greens are excellent with butter, and after your furry friend has watched you relish them for a while, you can stir some into her food. Although many herbal preparations for the eyes typically use a plant called eyebright (Euphrasia sp.) as a primary anti-inflammatory agent, many herbal- ists are becoming concerned about the increasing scarcity of this wild-harvested herb. Fortunately, nature always provides us with a diversity of herbal options—all that is required is for us to ignore market sensationalism and embrace the use of our less compromised plant allies. Nettle, a much more abundant plant, is a good alternative to eyebright. Nettle leaf tea is an excellent skin and coat rinse that nourishes animals’ fur and provides symptomatic relief for itchy skin and fleabites. Urtica dioica Many herbalists who suffer from sea- sonal allergies have found that nettle leaf tincture or tea helps lessen their symp- toms if taken on a regular basis. In a recent study involving sixty-nine patients who suffer from allergic rhinitis, 58 per- cent found relief after taking a freeze- dried preparation of the leaf. Although the theories behind the medicinal actions of nettle are varied, we believe that part of the basis for net- tle’s antiallergenic usefulness may lie in the plant’s histamine content, which may work in a like-versus-like manner similar to the concepts of homeopathy. What we mean is that by introducing a substance into the body that acts mild- ly as an allergenic antagonist, the body is triggered into protecting itself from what it believes to be an inevitable, all- out attack of allergens. In short, nettle may prompt the body into preparing itself. For animals with predictable sea- sonal occurrences of allergies, dietary supplementation with dried nettle leaf may help. Nettle root may be useful in the treat- ment of prostate enlargement, especially at early onset of the disorder. Although a swollen prostate is not as common in animals as in humans, this disorder is sometimes secondary to a chronic or acute infection, poor diet, inflammatory disease, or injuries of the urinary tract, especially in older animals. In a study conducted on human subjects who had mild cases or early onset of prostatic ade- noma (a degenerative enlargement of the glandular part of the prostate that typically results in frequent urination during the night), the fluid extract (tinc- ture) of nettle root was found to reduce the duration and volume of urine reten- tion and thus the need to urinate throughout the night. The active con- stituent in this case is believed to be Beta-sitosterol, a phytosterol known to possess mild anti-inflammatory activity. Although this action is not likely to reduce the formation of scar tissue with- in the urinary tract and prostate, it is believed to relieve symptoms through reduction of swelling in surrounding tis- sues. Given the safety of this herb and the functional similarities between the prostates of animals and humans, nettle is certainly worth a try. Keep in mind that large doses of nettle can be irritat- ing to the kidneys if given over an extended period of time, particularly if an animal has preexisting kidney disease or if the herb was gathered too late in its growth cycle. Availability: Available wherever bulk herbs are sold Propagation and Harvest: Nettle can be transplanted from root cuttings, but the plant tends to be somewhat choosy about where it grows. Although we know exactly where the plant should thrive, our efforts to introduce nettle to such an area have met with a less than 50 percent success rate. In other words, you are probably better off finding a healthy patch of wild plants to collect your herb. Gather the plants before they bloom—the younger the better. Mature plants begin to develop cystoliths, tiny crystalline particles in the leaf tissues that can irritate the urinary tract and kidneys when ingested in large enough quanti- ties. After gathering, you can boil the greens and serve them as you would spinach, or you can spread them onto clean newspapers and allow them to dry in a well-ventilated, sunlight-free loca- tion until they are crispy. For obvious reasons, gloves and a long-sleeved shirt should be worn when handling nettle plants. If a leaf or stem manages to sneak under your shirtsleeve, try this trick: grasp a piece of the stem Herbs for Pets 154 n Materia Medica 155 o and squeeze some of the nettle juice onto the affected area. The stem juice is rich in lecithin, which is believed to anti- dote the sting. We manage to get stung by this plant several times each spring, and we find relief by using this method in many of our adverse encounters. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For anti- inflammatory eye and skin washes, alter- natives include raspberry leaf, chamomile, dandelion, calendula, or oxeye daisy. For conjunctivitis that is secondary to bacte- rial or fungal infection, nettle combines well with Oregon grape. Nutritive adjuncts include spirulina, flaxseed, red clover, and alfalfa. For allergies, nettle combines well with elecampane, colts- foot, goldenrod, lobelia, or licorice as lesser adjuncts. For urinary incontinence and inflammations of the urinary tract, consider couch grass, corn silk, cleavers, uva ursi, goldenrod, and marshmallow as adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Touching the live plant results in a painful, blister- ing sting. Thorough drying or cooking neutralizes the toxic constituents. Some herbalists believe that this plant should be used before it flowers—mature plants contain gritty particles that can irritate the kidneys. Animals who are predis- posed to plant allergies may be sensitive to nettle—proceed with care. OAT Avena sativa Grass Family Appearance: Oats look very much like any other tall grass, and positive identifi- cation can be difficult if you’re not famil- iar with the fine details specific to the var- ious cultivars of the Avena genus. Wild oat (A. fatua), a common and often hated weed, has the same medicinal attributes as its cultivated relatives. The leaves of the seedlings and seeds of this 1- to 4-foot-tall plant have two unique features that differ- entiate it from its cultivated cousins and most other wild grasses. The first feature is the leaves. Early in growth, they have a counterclockwise twist in them; as the plant matures, the leaves progressively straighten out. The second unique char- acteristic is the plant’s seeds, which at maturity are presented in loosely arranged drooping spikelets. Each spikelet contains two or three foxtail-like seeds that have proportionately long hairlike awns, each of which has a right angle kink in it, giving the appearance of a crimped cockroach feeler. Habitat and Range: Several cultivars of A. sativa are commercially grown throughout the world. Wild oat (A. fatua) is a native of Europe that has been intro- duced into meadows, pastures, and Avena sativa waste areas throughout much of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that blooms from June to August. The seeds of wild oat can remain dormant in the soil for more than eight years, mak- ing it difficult to eradicate from areas where it isn’t wanted. Parts Used: Post-flowering tops are used before the seeds fully mature. This is called the plant’s milk stage. Herbalists refer to these parts as oatstraw. Primary Medicinal Activities: Im- proves nerve functions, nutritive, anti- inflammatory Strongest Affinities: Nervous system Preparation: Tea, tincture, fresh or dried herb Common Uses: Oatstraw is perhaps the best nervous system tonic for aging or debilitated animals. Not only does the herb contain considerable amounts of protein (gluten), vitamins, and minerals (especially calcium, manganese, iron, copper, and zinc) that are essential to the maintenance of health, but it contains various alkaloid, sterol, and flavonoid con- stituents that act together to safely opti- mize nervous system functions while sta- bilizing the highs and lows between nerv- ousness and mental lethargy. For instance, when fed in moderation to ani- mals with chronic nervousness, oatstraw tends to have a calming effect, but when fed to debilitated animals, it tends to stim- ulate the nervous system. Oatstraw tea or tincture is an excellent choice for animals recovering from exhaustion or suffering from depression disorders. It is known to improve nerve transmission and can be useful for problems such as epilepsy, tremors, paralysis, and twitching. It is a good tonic for nourishing the body and strengthening nerve function following periods of sedation or anesthesia. Dried oatstraw brews into a deli- cious tea that can be poured directly onto dog or cat food as a quickly assim- ilated tonic supplement. Infuse a heap- ing teaspoon of oatstraw in 8 ounces of hot water. Feeding 1 ounce of the cooled tea daily is a good amount for cats and animals of similar size. Give 2–4 ounces to most dogs. Glycerin tinctures are also good and can be added to your companion’s diet at a daily rate of 1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon (1–2 milli- liters) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Oatstraw is highly water soluble, so there is no point in using an alcohol-based tincture if nonalcohol alternatives are available. Of course, oats are a well-known feed for horses and other herbivores and should be included as part of their daily diet. In terms of tonic value, fresh oat greens are vastly superior to what is pur- chased in grain bags, but the greens must be fed in moderation. A few large hand- fuls can be added to the daily diet, but too much may cause hyperexcitability. Oatmeal can be included as part of your companion’s natural diet. It can also be used externally as a soothing bath for skin problems. Availability: Oatstraw is available through health food stores Propagation and Harvest: Oat is easy to grow, but it takes up a great deal of garden space. If you opt to grow it, har- vest the top 6–12 inches of the plants after the seeds have formed but before the plants begin to dry. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For depression disorders, oatstraw can be Herbs for Pets 156 o Materia Medica 157 o combined with Saint-John’s-wort, pas- sionflower, or chamomile (but consider changing you companion’s diet first). For treating epilepsy, oatstraw combines with skullcap, valerian, or kava kava. In animals who are recovering from anes- thesia or sedation, alterative and diuretic herbs should be combined with oatstraw in order to help cleanse and nourish the blood and eliminate systemic waste. Possibilities include red clover, dandelion leaf, alfalfa, garlic, and nettle. For older animals who need continuous nervous system support, oatstraw combines especially well with nettle, red clover, alfalfa, and spirulina. Cautions and Comments: Too much oatstraw may cause excitability or vomit- ing. If this occurs, simply reduce the amount being fed to the animal. OREGON GRAPE Mahonia aquifolium Barberry Family Appearance: At first glance, Oregon grape looks similar to American holly (Ilex opaca)—the stuff we deck the halls with during the Christmas sea- son. The almost plasticlike leaves of this perennial evergreen plant are divided into several opposing pairs of oval to lance-shaped, 1⁄2- to 3-inch-long leaflets. The leaf edges have conspicu- ous sharp spines. Flowers are yellow and are borne in clusters at the end of a sturdy central stalk. By midsummer, the flowers develop into clusters of juicy, purple, 1⁄4-to 1⁄2-inch fruits that resemble tiny grapes. The fruits are edi- ble but very sour. Habitat and Range: Three species of Oregon grape are common in the conifer- ous forests of western North America, ranging through the mountains of central California and New Mexico northward into Canada. Tall Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium) is a variety that grows up to 6 feet tall and is abundant in the coastal forests to the west slopes of the Rocky Mountains. Mahonia repens and M. ner- vosa are smaller (up to 12 inches tall), ground-hugging versions that are wide- spread throughout their range. A fourth less-common species (M. pinnata) inhab- its the mountains of Baja Mexico and California. All share similar appearances, the primary differentiating factor being their size. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennial evergreens that bloom in late spring Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, stimulates bile production, anti- inflammatory, tonic, antiparasitic Mahonia aquifolium Strongest Affinities: Liver and diges- tive system, mucous membranes Preparation: Tincture, tea, decoction, oil infusion, powdered root Common Uses: For most purposes, Oregon grape serves as an excellent alternative to goldenseal (Hydrastis canadensis), an herb that is currently at risk of going extinct from the pressures of overharvest and loss of habitat. Fortunately, Oregon grape remains com- mon and abundant over a much wider range than the overharvested goldenseal and is much easier to cultivate. So unless you have access to a cultivated source of goldenseal, please use Oregon grape instead. As is the case for goldenseal, a bitter yellow alkaloid called berberine is prima- rily responsible for the strong antimicro- bial activity of Oregon grape. The anti- bacterial properties of berberine have been shown to be more effective than some forms of prescription antibiotics, including chloramphenicol, when used against various forms of staphylococci. Berberine has also been shown to be active against E. coli and other gram- negative-type bacteria. It is even effec- tive against giardiasis, a parasitic infesta- tion of the digestive tract that is reputed- ly difficult to remedy. Like goldenseal, Oregon grape extract is especially useful in the ears, eyes, and the mucous mem- branes of the vagina and urinary tract, where it combats various fungal infec- tions as well. For bacterial ear infections or ear mites, an oil infusion of the fresh or dried root works best. To make an oil infusion, cut up the root as finely as possible and place it into a food processor or blender that has a glass or stainless steel blending vessel. (The roots are tough and might cause plastic to crack.) Cover the chopped root with enough olive oil to leave a 1⁄2-inch-thick layer above the herb. Put the lid on and blend until the oil is a vibrant, goldenrod-yellow color (about ten minutes). Strain the chopped root out through a fine sieve, and you’ll have a nice, antimicrobial ear oil. If you don’t wish to use your blender, you can let the chopped herb and olive oil mix- ture stand in a covered jar at room tem- perature for one month before straining. The finished product keeps for several months, sometimes years, if refrigerated. To use the oil, apply 1–10 drops at a time in each ear one to two times a day until the infection is gone. It is also good as a general topical antibiotic for stings, insect bites, cuts, abrasions, puncture injuries of the paws, and other injuries. Oregon grape is effective in treating conjunctivitis, where it fights infection and reduces inflammation. To treat your companion’s eyes with Oregon grape, dilute 4 drops of the alcohol tincture (available at your favorite herb store), or 8 drops of a root decoction, into 1 ounce of sterile saline (available anywhere con- tact lens supplies are sold). Place a few drops into the infected eye, taking note of any discomfort that may result from the berberine or the alcohol content of the tincture. Some animals are more intolerant than others. If the solution appears to irritate the eyes, dilute it with more saline and flush the eye with plain saline before applying more solution. Oregon grape root is also noted for its ability to stimulate liver function. It is particularly helpful in cases of chronic constipation associated with poor pro- tein or fat metabolism, situations that often lead to itchy, flaky skin and a dull coat in animals. Used under these cir- cumstances, Oregon grape extract can bring fast and dramatic results, and it does so by addressing an underlying cause of the problem. Generally speak- Herbs for Pets 158 o Materia Medica 159 o ing from a holistic perspective, many forms of dermatitis are symptoms of an underlying liver dysfunction. If the liver cannot eliminate excess toxins or is func- tionally compromised by blockages that reduce bile flow or production, the digestive tract fails at its job of eliminat- ing waste. One of the first places the body tries to force elimination is through the skin. Oregon grape works in the liver much like a strong version of dande- lion—bile production and flow is increased, and digestive efficiency is improved. But Oregon grape stimulates liver function much faster than does dan- delion, irritating the organ into working harder. For this reason, Oregon grape should not be used in animals with acute liver disease or existing liver injuries with- out the supervision of a trained profes- sional. And although Oregon grape is safe when used properly, it is likely to overexcite the liver of most animals if used excessively. If this occurs, your ani- mal will probably vomit because of excessive bile in the stomach; you should stop using Oregon grape and consider a gentler herb such as dandelion. In any case, it is best not to give any herbal medicine every day of an animal’s life. Instead, give whatever herbs you are using four to five days per week, then let the animal’s system rest for two or three days before proceeding. This break time also gives you an opportunity to monitor changes that may be occurring as a result of your therapeutic efforts. The bitter tonic action of the alkaloid constituents in Oregon grape make this herb a useful digestive aid. When a drop or two of the root tincture is placed on the tongue, or when a leaf is chewed, an instantaneous salivary response occurs. At the same time, mechanisms are triggered that release bile and vari- ous other enzymes and acids into the digestive tract. The digestive system is therefore primed into action before the food arrives. Giving this bitter tonic daily is an excellent holistic approach to safely treating chronic indigestion and malabsorption. If you or your animal has problems with excess gas or with foods that tend to pass through undi- gested, try using a small dose of Oregon grape before each meal. The results will probably amaze you. Oregon grape can also be used as an antibacterial in the urinary tract and is regarded by herbalists as an effective remedy for infections of the bladder, kidneys, and urethra. Again, the anti- bacterial effect of Oregon grape in the urinary tract is attributable to berber- ine, which stays effective long enough to reach deep into the body. Since most infections of the urinary tract are associ- ated with uncomfortable inflammation, combining this herb with the soothing effects of marshmallow, licorice, or plantain is a good idea. Generally, a for- mula made with one part Oregon grape to two parts of other soothing herbs is a good infection-fighting, pain-relieving approach. When combined in small proportions with echinacea, Oregon grape combats the infection directly while the immune system plays catch-up with invading pathogens. At the same time, Oregon grape helps to support the liver at its job of keeping the body clean through elim- ination of waste, a critical process of maintaining balanced body functions while the body heals. And while conven- tional antibiotic therapies tend not to discriminate between beneficial microbes and bad ones, the body is allowed to fight infection by natural mechanisms with a properly proportioned berberine-con- taining herbal support formula without compromising its own microbial war- riors. Instead, it receives a measured degree of outside support and is gently stimulated into working harder toward victory. A formula consisting of 10 per- cent Oregon grape and 90 percent echi- nacea is generally appropriate for this purpose. In addition to its liver and disinfectant benefits, berberine is known to possess mild but useful sedative qualities and may be effective as an anticonvulsive remedy. It has also been shown to help lower blood pressure and is believed to slightly elevate blood sugar levels in hypoglycemic animals. Availability: The plants are available through landscape nurseries. Oregon grape root is available in a variety of forms from herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Oregon grape is widely adaptable to gardens throughout most of North America. Tall Oregon grape (M. aquifolium) is the most common variety in commerce and is becoming popular as a landscape shrub. It is quite easy to grow from root cut- tings, seeds, or transplants. These plants are drought tolerant and winter hardy. All they essentially need is slightly acidic soil and plenty of redwood compost, but they flourish when afforded at least three hours of shade each day and a good weekly watering. Roots can be dug from mature plants anytime during the year. They can be dried and kept in plastic bags for two or three years. Alternatives and Adjuncts: In ear oils, combine with garlic and vitamin E oil. To aid in liver congestion and to improve digestion, dandelion root serves as a weak- er alternative. For Giardia and worms, Oregon grape combines with garlic. In eyewashes, Oregon grape combines espe- cially well with raspberry leaf. For urinary tract infections, marshmallow, plantain, or licorice serve as soothing adjuncts. Cautions and Comments: Oregon grape should not be used in animals with acute liver disease or existing liver injuries without the supervision of a pro- fessional. It has been theorized that too much berberine may inhibit vitamin B assimilation. OXEYE DAISY Chrysanthemum Sunflower Family leucanthemum Appearance: It brings us satisfaction to tell you about useful plants that can be easily grown in any garden, but it brings us special joy to tell you about useful plants that already grow on the edges of driveways and in vacant lots. Oxeye daisy is such a plant. To the herbalist, a weed is simply a plant with attributes that have yet to be realized. When the usefulness of such plants is brought to light, people reconsider their approaches to weed control. This usually means a reduction in the use of toxic herbicides, which end up in the environment. Oxeye daisy is a wild relative of pyrethrum daisy (genus Pyrethrum), which is cultivated for its insecticidal properties. Oxeye daisy looks similar to the pyrethrum daisy; in fact at first glance it looks like any other white daisy. But close examination of this plant’s unique leaf characteristics makes it easy to differentiate from all others during any stage of its perennial growth cycle. The basal leaves of oxeye have proportionately long petioles (leaf stems) and are spoon-shaped with rounded teeth along the edges. The leaves of the upper plant lack petioles, and the flowers are typically daisylike: white with yellow centers and up to 3 inches wide. The entire plant may reach 3 feet in height. Herbs for Pets 160 o Materia Medica 161 o Habitat and Range: Oxeye daisy is a Eurasian import that is now common to roadsides and dry waste areas through- out the northern half of North America, up to about 6,000 feet in elevation. Cycle and Bloom Season: Plants bloom first in early summer, then often remain in bloom until fall. Parts Used: Leaves and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- histamine, insecticidal (used for fleas), diuretic, stops bleeding Strongest Affinities: Respiratory tract, skin Preparation: Tea, tincture, or dried powdered herb Common Uses: The leaves are recog- nized by some contemporary herbalists for their diuretic and hemostatic quali- ties, and clinical research suggests that the leaf tea may also be effective as an antihistamine medicine that slows the body’s responses to allergens while help- ing to reduce excess secretions of mucus. The flower tea is especially useful for helping to relieve seasonal hay fever characterized by sneezing and watery discharges from the nose and eyes. At the onset of symptoms, 1 tablespoon of the strong tea can be fed to dogs as part of their daily diet throughout the crisis period. Cats and other small mammals need only 1 teaspoon. Horses and other herbivores can be allowed to eat the fresh plants from their pastures, and rab- bits can be given a stem or two of the flowering plant each day. As is true of its cultivated cousins, the flowers of oxeye daisy contain use- ful amounts of pyrethrin, a natural insecticide that is useful for controlling fleas. To use oxeye daisy in this capaci- ty, make a skin rinse from the fresh chopped flowers or apply the dried flowers as a mildly effective but safe and natural flea powder. As a diuretic, oxeye daisy can increase urinary output and dilute urine that is over-concentrated, strong smelling, and too acidic, and it lends weak but measurable astringent and antimicrobial properties to inflamed uri- nary membranes. Oxeye daisy is often abundant on the margins of horse and stock trails, making it readily available as a first aid remedy for minor cuts, fly bites, and such. The fresh-leaf poultice can be applied directly to the site of injury to help stop bleeding. Combine it with one of many antimicrobial herbs that grows nearby (such as yarrow or bee balm), and you’ll have an excellent, broad-spectrum field dressing. Pyrethrum roseum Availability: A widely distributed weed, oxeye daisy is available through nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Oxeye daisy is easy to grow from seeds or transplants. It is drought tolerant, winter hardy, and adaptable to any soil. All oxeye daisy real- ly needs is full sun. Alternatives and Adjuncts: As a flea- fighting alternative, try feverfew. For sea- sonal allergies, oxeye daisy can be com- bined with or replaced by nettle. Dandelion leaf is a much more effective diuretic. Cautions and Comments: Some ani- mals may be highly allergic to this plant— test a small amount of the tea on your companion’s skin before using. If redness or any other response occurs, don’t feed it to your animal! PARSLEY Petroselinum crispum Parsley Family Appearance: There are numerous culti- vars of this familiar herb—their primary differences being leaf size and root varia- tions. The most common varieties have tightly curled leaves, whereas Italian parsley (P. crispus var. neapolitanum) has leaves that are more like those of celery. Hamburg parsley (P. crispum var. tubero- sum) has a thick turniplike taproot and fernlike leaves. All produce terminate umbel flowers, and most will grow to about 3 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Originally a native of southeast Europe and west Asia, pars- ley is now cultivated worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms in midsummer Parts Used: Leaves, seeds, and roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Expels intestinal gas, lowers blood pressure, nutritive, diuretic, helps reduce arthritic inflammation, promotes menstrual dis- charge, insecticidal, antimicrobial Strongest Affinities: Digestive and urinary tracts, joints Preparation: Tea, tincture, or fresh or dried herb Common Uses: Parsley is much more than a plate garnish. In fact, it is one of the most versatile medicinal plants around—it is an absolute “must have” in the home herb garden. Parsley root is known by herbalists as an excellent diuretic that is especially beneficial in the treatment of rheuma- toid conditions. For humans, it is con- sidered a specific remedy in the treat- ment of gout; it is believed to help with the elimination of uric acid that would otherwise contribute to the buildup of painful crystals in the joints. For ani- mals, parsley root is useful in cases of arthritis that are compounded or per- haps even caused by poor waste elimi- nation, a problem that is often the result of a poor diet. For these purpos- es, dogs and cats can be given a strong tea of the dried or freshly grated root (1 teaspoon of the strong tea per day for cats; 1–2 tablespoons for dogs), or a tincture can be used (1–2 milliliters per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight). Horses can be fed a few hand- fuls of the entire fresh plant (leaves, roots, and all) each day, or a cup of the dried herb daily. Parsley root is especially effective when combined with alternatives, hepatics, and anti- inflammatory herbs. Parsley leaves and stems are very nutritious, containing up to 22 percent protein and impressive amounts of vita- Herbs for Pets 162 p Materia Medica 163 p mins A, C, B1, B2, and K, as well as fiber, calcium, riboflavin, potassium, iron, magnesium, niacin, and phosphorus. This makes parsley an excellent nutritive in the treatment of anemia. The leaves also contain apiol and several other volatile oils that have antiseptic qualities, making the herb useful for urinary tract infections. And because parsley is a diuretic, it may help boost kidney func- tion in cases of noninflammatory, early- onset renal failure. Apiol also has a stim- ulant and strengthening effect on intes- tinal and uterine muscles, making it suit- able for improving uterine muscle tone after a difficult pregnancy. In the diges- tive tract, this tonic activity combines with parsley’s carminative properties, making it effective in the treatment of flatulent dyspepsia and colic. Perhaps the best way to use parsley leaf for gastric or urinary disorders or for its nutritional qualities is to juice it. If you don’t have a vegetable juicer, pack an electric blender halfway full with fresh leaves and add just enough water to liq- uefy the leaves into a dark green soup. The juice, or “blender soup,” can be fed directly to an animal with an empty stomach (the best option) or added to your companion’s drinking water (sec- ond best) or food (the last resort)—1 tea- spoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. The juice (or a few drops of the leaf tincture) also serves as an excel- lent breath freshener. Availability: Plants are available through nurseries. The herb is also available in various forms through health food and herb retailers everywhere. Propagation and Harvest: Parsley is easy to grow from seed or transplants. If given rich, well-drained soil, it will return year after year. If allowed to go to seed, it will sprout up all over the garden. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For rheum- atoid conditions, shepherd’s purse serves as an effective substitute. For urinary infec- tions, consider corn silk, couch grass, echi- nacea, uva ursi, and horsetail as alterna- tives or adjuncts. For colic and other diges- tive disorders, fennel, dill, slippery elm, plantain, marshmallow, cleavers, and licorice should all be investigated. Raspberry leaf or nettle serves as alterna- tive uterine tonics or nutritives. Cautions and Comments: Parsley, in dried, fresh, or tea form is very safe. However, highly concentrated prepara- tions of the seed, such as parsley essen- tial oil, are rich in volatile oils that can be absorbed into the placenta, so don’t use the essential oil internally or externally during an animal’s pregnancy. While it is thought to aid the healing process after birthing, it may reduce lactation and Petroselinum crispum should be used conservatively in nursing mothers. Parsley should not be used if inflammation of the kidneys exists. Parsley seeds contain the highest con- centration of volatile oils, including a considerable amount of myristicin. Myristicin can have strong hypotensive and hallucinogenic effects, especially in cats, and may cause liver damage or photosensitivity if ingested in large enough quantities. Although such instances are rare, and it’s unlikely that an animal could eat enough parsley seed to cause such problems, it’s best to be safe by using only parsley leaves, stems, and roots, which contain much lower concentrations of myristicin. PLANTAIN Plantago sp. Plantain Family Appearance: Common plantain (Plant- ago major) is characterized by its low-grow- ing rosette of broad leaves and its rather drab but distinctive flower cluster. The stur- dy succulent leaves are on proportionately long petioles and have distinct parallel veins that contain strong fibers. Flowers are small and inconspicuous, borne in tightly arranged sausage-shaped spikes atop leaf- less stalks that reach well above the rest of the plant. Ten or more species of the Plantago genus inhabit western North America, with common plantain by far the most widespread and abundant. Habitat and Range: Common plan- tain is frequently found in high impact areas, growing in the center of dirt roads, walkways, and even the cracks in highways. It is widespread throughout most of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or perennial that blooms March through August Parts Used: All parts of the plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Lubri- cates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; emollient; astringent; anti- inflammatory; stops bleeding Strongest Affinities: Digestive and uri- nary tracts, skin Preparation: Tincture, tea, poultice, or dried seed husks Common Uses: Plantain is one of many useful plants that have been forgotten by virtue of its abundance and its reputation as a weed. Many of us step on it while en route to the vegetable garden, unaware that it may be more nutritious than the vegetables we tend. Plantain is high in vitamins C, A, and K. In essence, plantain can be used in the same ways as slippery elm. The mucilagi- nous and astringent qualities of plantain make it an excellent remedy for reducing inflammations inside and on the body. The aucubin and saponin constituents of plantain have been shown to have anti- bacterial properties, especially against Micrococcus flavus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Bacillus subtilus. All of these activities combine to make plantain useful in a wide range of urinary, digestive, and res- piratory ailments. In the urinary tract, plantain can help stop minor bleeding, reduce inflamma- tion, and relieve pain that is secondary to bacterial infection or the passing of small stones (gravel). In the digestive tract, plantain relieves diarrhea and the symptoms of various types of inflamma- tory bowel disease. Its lubricating prop- erties and anti-inflammatory activities make it useful for treating irritations of the stomach and intestinal tract that occur when an animal eats something that is difficult to pass such as pine Herbs for Pets 164 p Materia Medica 165 p needles, a bottle cap, or a brand-new sequined handbag. Plantago psyllium is widely known for its seeds and husks, which are used as an effective laxative and a source of dietary fiber. In the upper respiratory tract, plantain helps soothe raspy coughs such as those caused by inhaled dust or canine tra- cheobronchitis (kennel cough). Plantain is best used fresh. If you have an electric juicer, liquefy the entire plant, roots and all. Otherwise, chop the washed plants as finely as you can, pack them loosely into a blender, add just enough warm water to cover the herb, and blend the mixture into a dark-green gooey soup. Don’t use boil- ing water because it destroys hydrolytic enzymes that have antibacterial proper- ties. You might end up with a tangle of the strong leaf fibers wrapped around the blades of your machine—this is nor- mal. Strain the liquid through a sieve and refrigerate it in a sealed glass jar until you need it. It will keep for about two weeks in a very cold refrigerator. To use the juice for internal problems, 1 teaspoon can be fed for each 20 pounds of a dog’s body weight, once or twice daily. Cats can take up to a tea- spoon of the juice twice daily. It’s best to administer the juice before a meal and with as little added water as possi- ble. If this isn’t possible, the juice can be added to your companion’s food. For colic, the removal of sand in the diges- tive tract, and other digestive problems in horses or other large animals, a hand- ful or two of the fresh plants can be fed as part of a daily diet. A poultice of plantain is one of the best topical first aid remedies for insect bites, stings, minor burns, and site-spe- cific contact dermatitis (such as minor bouts with stinging nettle). An oil infu- sion or salve of the fresh or dried plant can be used for the same purposes. Availability: A widely distributed weed. The husks of P. psyllium are available through any respectable health food store, and several psyllium products are now being produced specifically for use in animals. The seeds of several varieties can be purchased through specialty catalogs. Propagation and Harvest: Plantain is easy to grow—all it needs is ample water during its germination. Sow the tiny seeds as sparsely as you can under 1⁄8 inch of soil, and keep them wet until they sprout. The plants can be harvested and used anytime, but the mature sec- ond-year and older plants make the best medicine. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Plantain can be used as a substitute for slippery elm, a hardwood tree that is being over- Plantago major harvested for its medicinal inner bark. Marshmallow root contains far more mucilage than plantain does, and it serves as a more effective alternative in cases in which digestive or urinary tract lubrication is needed. In situations in which the astringency and mucilage content of plantain are not enough to bring relief to urinary irritations, try com- bining marshmallow with a stronger astringent such as uva ursi or rose bark. Cautions and Comments: Side effects are rare with this plant, but some ani- mals may be allergic to it. If your com- panion is predisposed to plant allergies, test for sensitivity by applying a small amount to the skin. If no reaction occurs, proceed with a small internal dose (a few drops), and watch for sneezing, watery eyes, or other signs of allergic response. RASPBERRY Rubus sp. Rose Family Appearance: Raspberries are generally categorized by color—red or black. Leaf and stem characteristics vary between species of this widespread genus of shrubs. Most have divided leaves and five-petal flowers that range from white to crimson in color. The plants are gener- ally found as tangled masses of thorny trailing biennial stems that yield a tasty reward to those brave enough to reach the choicest berries. All species are med- icinally useful. Habitat and Range: As one travels northward through the Rocky Mountains and the coastal states of the West, the diversity of species and the number of roadside bramble patches encountered progressively increases. Many species of Rubus are regarded as invasive weeds. They are common and often abundant inhabitants of pastures, roadside ditches, and riparian habitats. This genus often cross-pollinates, making exact identifica- tion of species difficult in many areas. And many species have escaped cultiva- tion, making it anybody’s guess where one of these plants will pop up next. Red raspberry (R. idaeus—illustrated) is one of the most common indigenous species found throughout North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennials that bloom and produce fruit from second-year plants, known as canes Parts Used: Dried leaves and, of course, the delicious fruit Primary Medicinal Activities: Astringent, strengthens the uterus (uterotonic), nutritive, diuretic, laxative, mild sedative Strongest Affinities: Female repro- ductive system, eyes, skin Preparation: Infusion, poultice, or tincture Common Uses: Raspberry leaf is a safe and gentle medicinal food. Aside from its nutritional value (it is especially high in vitamin C), raspberry leaf tea has mild astringent qualities that make it useful for a wide variety of remedial and tonic therapies. Taken internally, the tea is use- ful for treating minor digestive tract inflammations and can be used as a rem- edy for mild cases of diarrhea. In such instances, a strong infusion can be fed at a dose of 2 ounces per 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight (or 1 ounce for cats), twice daily as needed for relief. Alternatively, the dried leaf can be used—1 teaspoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, sprinkled onto food daily. For bleeding or inflamed gums, the powdered leaf can be applied directly to Herbs for Pets 166 r Materia Medica 167 r the site of the problem, or the tea can be applied to the gums with a cotton swab. Traditionally, the leaf tea is perhaps the most widely used “female tonic” in existence. It acts to improve the tone and elasticity of smooth muscle tissues in and around the uterus. It is useful as a prepregnancy tonic and in pregnant or postpartum dogs, cats, horses, and other animals during the final weeks of preg- nancy. The dried leaf can be sprinkled onto your animal’s food (at the previous- ly mentioned doses) as a daily tonic, or it can be fed as a tea. Make the tea by steeping 1 teaspoon of the dried leaf (in a tea ball) in 8 ounces of hot water. The tea can be added to your animal’s drinking water until the water is notice- ably colored. The animal can then drink at will. Raspberry leaf is especially beneficial in the form of a saline eyewash for symp- tomatic relief of conjunctivitis. To make an eyewash, infuse 1 teaspoon of dried raspberry leaf in 8 ounces of hot distilled water. Allow the tea to cool, strain it through a coffee filter, then combine it with enough sterile saline solution to produce a slightly tinted solution. The cooled full-strength tea can also be used as a soothing scalp or skin rinse— its astringency helps to relieve minor itchiness. Availability: Raspberry leaf is available at health food stores. The canes are avail- able through most nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Raspberries are easy to grow. Transplanted canes pro- duce an abundance of leaves, and they produce their first fruit during their sec- ond year of growth and every year there- after. The plants like moist, potassium- rich soil and full sun. Harvest the leaves just before the plants bloom in spring or early summer. Dry them on a clean non- metallic surface until they are crispy dry. The dried leaves can be stored in plastic bags for a year or more. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Raspberry serves as a less-threatened substitute for eyebright (Euphrasia spp.), a plant that is currently at risk of disappearing because of overharvest. The leaves of strawberry (Fragaria spp.) can be used as a substi- tute for raspberry leaf. As a female tonic, nettle leaf tea serves as a better substi- tute because it contains a much richer array of vital nutrients. Nettle can also be used in eye and skin washes. For con- junctivitis or inflammation of the mouth that is secondary to bacterial or fungal infection, raspberry leaf combines well with Oregon grape and echinacea. If the problem appears to be of viral origin, mullein leaf or Saint-John’s-wort may serve as an effective adjunct. For diarrhea Rubus idaeus and internal bleeding, stronger alterna- tives include uva ursi, horsetail, plantain, and cayenne. Cautions and Comments: Never use raspberry leaves that are not completely dry. As the leaves wilt, they temporarily develop toxins that can be nauseating to your animal. Despite old claims of raspberry leaf causing uterine contractions, no quali- fied reports of toxicity have been record- ed for this herb. RED CLOVER Trifolium pratense Pea Family Appearance: Red clover was intro- duced to the U.S. from Europe as a feed crop for livestock and has since escaped cultivation to make itself at home throughout North America. It is charac- terized by the predominantly three- lobed leaves of the Trifolium genus, of which dozens of species and cultivars are distributed throughout the West. The differences among these many species may be minute, and positive identifica- tion of a specific Trifolium sp. can be challenging. First, the identification of red clover can begin by recognizing its red, globe-shaped flowers and its soft, hairy stems. Second, we can see that the flower stems (pedicels) are shorter in length than each of the leaf stems (peti- oles). And finally, red clover has a small carrotlike taproot, whereas many clovers have horizontally creeping roots systems (rhizomes). If all of this fails to answer the question of identity, cheat—find some red clover that has been cultivated and formulate personalized notes for future reference. Habitat and Range: Red clover is wide- spread in cultivated fields, road margins, gardens, and other disturbed areas where the plant has been introduced largely through agricultural activities. Cycle and Bloom Season: A short-lived perennial that blooms in early summer Parts Used: Flowering tops Primary Medicinal Activities: Helps with blood cleansing, diuretic, expecto- rant, tonic, antispasmodic, nutritive, antitumor, effects estrogen production in the body (estrogenic) Strongest Affinities: Liver, blood, and skin Preparation: Tea, dried or fresh herb, or tincture Common Uses: Although traditionally red clover has been used and highly acclaimed as a blood-purifying alterative and anticancer agent for hundreds, per- haps thousands, of years, few scientific studies have been conducted to substan- tiate these claims. Regardless, thousands of herbalists and an equal number of people who have witnessed red clover’s potential as a healing agent and preven- tative seem to know something. At the root of red clover’s attributes is an impressive array of protein, magnesium, calcium, potassium, and vitamin C and B complex. All of these nutrients are joined with a complex assortment of medicinal- ly active chemical compounds. In the mind of a holistically oriented herbalist, all of these components synergistically amount to an excellent remedy for pso- riasis, eczema, and other skin disorders, especially those believed to be secondary to excess waste materials in the blood- stream. For such disorders, red clover may be used internally or externally. Internally, a flower tea or tincture gently Herbs for Pets 168 r Materia Medica 169 R stimulates the liver and gallbladder to help optimize digestion and replenish the blood. Externally, a cooled tea or poultice can be applied to flaky dry, itchy skin for symptomatic relief. Added to an animal’s daily diet as a preventive meas- ure, you can give a pinch of dried red clover to a dog; a tinier pinch to a cat; and a handful to horses, llamas, and sheep. A rabbit can be fed a flower or two a day, and for other animals, as with any herb, moderation is the single-word golden rule. In horses, red clover is sometimes fed to speed recovery from viral infections of the respiratory tract, particularly when a persistent cough or excessive secretion of thick mucus from inflamed mucous mem- branes (catarrh) seem to be slowing the healing process by adding stress to a run- down animal. Feed 1⁄2–2 cups of the flower heads daily as part of the animal’s feed. If tea is a better option, 3 or 4 heaping tablespoons of the dried flowers steeped in a pint of water can be fed daily. Much of red clover’s reputation as an anticancer herb stems from its inclusion in the famed Hoxsey Formula and the still popular Essiac Formula, although skeptics argue that the effectiveness of these formulas are without validation. Both of these formulas have been used extensively during the past seventy-five years, and many cancer sufferers, practi- tioners, and pet owners have claimed near-miraculous results from them. In addition to these formulas, red clover is often used by itself—again with many favorable claims. As mentioned, scientif- ic evidence to support these claims is scarce but certainly exists. In 1988, a study published in The Journal of Cancer Research indicated that the anticancer activity of red clover may in fact be a sci- entific reality. Specifically, it was found that the flavonoid constituents in red clover blossoms inhibit the harmful activ- ities of a carcinogenic substance called benzopyrene, a compound present in charbroiled foods. In an earlier 1970 study that was published in the same journal, the flavonoid quercetin found in red clover was shown to prevent ben- zopyrene from becoming active in the liver and small intestines. While these studies fall short of identifying the breadth of red clover’s activity against various other carcinogens, they certain- ly indicate that further research is war- ranted and add credibility to what holistic practitioners have been telling us all along. In animals with cancerous lesions of the skin or extremities, a poultice of red clover flowers can be applied in the form of a compress for several hours each day until the animal’s condition (hopefully) improves. Internal doses of the flower tea or tincture can be used in dogs, cats, Trifolium pratense horses, and other animals as well. In the fight against cancer, anything that can be applied safely and without contribut- ing stress to an already stressed body is certainly worth a try. In our minds, red clover is at the top of the list. Availability: Seed catalogs, feed stores, health food stores, and other herb retailers Propagation and Harvest: If you have rich, moist soil and a section of gar- den you wish to delegate to the spread- ing, strong-rooted nature of this plant, red clover can be easily propagated from seed. Harvest the flowers during dry weather in early summer. Use them fresh or dry them indoors on a piece of clean paper. The dried flowers keep for a year if properly stored. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For skin problems that are secondary to poor liver metabolism or excessive systemic waste, red clover combines well with yel- low dock, alfalfa, burdock, dandelion root, and nettle. Cautions and Comments: When properly used, red clover is a safe herb, but, as is true for many plants, its use does demand some attention and respect. First, do not use red clover for animals with clotting disorders or in the presence of internal or external bleed- ing. This plant contains the compound coumarin, which is cited in many toxi- cology texts as having blood-thinning qualities. However, recent studies sug- gest that the coumarin alone do not really possess blood-thinning proper- ties. Instead, it is now thought that blood-thinning properties may only occur when certain molds or fungi develop on the herb as result of improper drying. Red clover is also known to contain estrogenic isoflavone constituents that may prove toxic to livestock and other animals if fed in large quantities. Cases of acute skin and digestive disorders have been reported in horses, sheep, cattle, and other ani- mals who have been allowed to ex- cessively overgraze on fresh red clover. Red clover also possesses some phyto- estrogenic principles that contraindi- cate this herb’s use in pregnant or lactating animals. ROSE Rosa spp. Rose Family Appearance: Most people are familiar with roses. Hundreds of cultivars adorn flower beds to please the senses and stir the emotions of millions of people worldwide. In addition to the healing power of their beauty, all roses are med- icinally useful. The wild species (of which there are dozens in North America) offer the best-tasting, most nutritional hips. Wild roses look and smell very much like their domesticated counterparts except that they have smaller flowers and leaves. Characterized by their white-to- pink (sometimes yellow), five-petaled flowers, thorny stems, and bright red to purplish fruit (hips), these plants repre- sent a safe, easy-to-identify, delightful introduction to nature’s pantry and apothecary. Habitat and Range: Wild roses like con- sistently moist soil and are often found standing in dense thickets at road mar- gins, in irrigation ditches, and especially as the “defensive edge” of riparian habi- tats up to about 6,000 feet in elevation. Several species are native throughout North America. Wood’s rose (Rosa wood- sii) represents one of the most widespread pink-flowered species to be found in west- ern North America. Multiflora rose (R. Herbs for Pets 170 r Materia Medica 171 r multiflora) grows profusely throughout the midwestern U.S. and eastern Canada, where it forms dense thickets and is often considered a troublesome weed. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms June through August Parts Used: Hips, flower petals, leaves, stems, and bark Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutri- tive, astringent, bacteriostatic Strongest Affinities: Digestive system, urinary tract, skin Preparation: Fresh or dried hips, petals, leaves, and bark; tincture, tea, or decoction Common Uses: When we think of roses as medicine, we tend to remem- ber reading “Vitamin C with Rose Hips” on product labels. But actually, the nutritive value of rose hips repre- sents only a small fraction of the heal- ing attributes this plant has to offer. Native Americans used all parts of Rosa spp. in a wide variety of applica- tions. The seeds were cooked and ingested for relief from muscular pains. The roots were used as a general pur- pose astringent for diarrhea, sore throat, conjunctivitis, and to stop bleeding. The flower petals were employed as a bacteriostatic protective bandage on burns and minor wounds and as a treatment for colic and heart- burn. A poultice of the leaves was used for insect stings and bites. All of these uses can be safely applied to animals. Each part of a rose plant represents a different level of astringency. The flower petals are mildly to moderately astringent and can be made into a sweet-smelling rinse for animals with dry, itchy skin. Petal tea is also useful for mild to moderate cases of colic and diarrhea or for minor irritations of the mouth and stomach. Making a tea is simple—infuse a handful of fresh petals in a cup of near-boiling water. After the tea has cooled, it can be fed to dogs and cats at a dose of 1 table- spoon per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, as needed. If necessary it can be added to your companion’s drinking water. The cooled and strained tea is also useful as an anti- inflammatory eyewash, especially in cases where redness and eye rubbing is attributable to dust or other environ- mental irritants. The leaves are stronger than the flower petals and can be decocted for use as a rinse for contact dermatitis or inflamed fleabites or fly bites. Internally, the leaf decoction is useful Rosa woodsii for cystitis and acute digestive tract inflammations that may be secondary to bacterial or parasitic infection. A typical dose is a 1⁄2 teaspoon for each 30 pounds of the animal’s weight, once or twice daily, for no longer than four days. The bark and stems offer the strongest astringency and may be use- ful for acute cases of urinary or diges- tive tract inflammation that involve labored or painful urination, gushing diarrhea, or minor bleeding. Care must be taken to avoid feeding sharp rose thorns to your companion. The dose is the same as for a leaf decoction, but the maximum duration of use is short- er—the bark and stem decoction should not be used internally for more than two days. Rose hips are high in vitamin C and serve as a tasty and nutritious treat for animals. Our dogs harvest and eat them as trail snacks! The whole hip can be fed either fresh or dried. Dried hips can be ground in an electric coffee grinder and added to your compan- ion’s food as a nutritional supplement. Dogs and cats can be fed 1⁄2–1 tea- spoon of the ground hips per cup of food. Horses and other large herbi- vores can be fed a handful or two each day. Because of the ascorbic acid con- tent, too much rose hip causes stom- ach upset or diarrhea. If this happens, cut back on the amount in the daily feedings. Availability: Hundreds of rose vari- eties are available through nurseries. The best are the smaller-flowered wild species that are available through nurs- eries that specialize in native plants. Propagation and Harvest: Roses are easy to grow. They prosper in moist, slightly acidic soil. Leaves and flowers can be harvested any time as long as they look healthy. The hips are harvested in the fall after they turn bright red but before they shrivel. The hips can be dried indoors on a clean piece of paper. They keep for several years if stored in a glass jar and kept away from direct sunlight. Don’t grind the hips until you need them, otherwise you greatly shorten their shelf life. Harvest the stem bark when you prune your roses each year. Most domesticated varieties have large thorns that can be snapped off. If this isn’t possible, you can use the small thornless end stems and peduncles (the stem part just beneath the flow- ers and hips). The stems can be cut into small segments with pruning clippers or chopped with a sharp knife. They can then be decocted, just like the bark. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Rasp- berry leaf, nettle, and chamomile serve as alternatives where a mild urinary or digestive astringent is indicated. For acute cystitis or colic, rose leaf or bark combines with marshmallow, licorice, or slippery elm. Skin rinse alternatives include calendula, chamomile, uva ursi, and juniper. For conjunctivitis, raspberry leaf serves as a replacement, and Oregon grape serves as an excellent antimicro- bial adjunct. Cautions and Comments: The high tannin content in the bark can irritate the urinary tract and kidneys and can trigger uterine contractions, therefore rose bark is best avoided in pregnant animals or those with preexisting kid- ney problems. Internal use should be limited to acute disorders and short- term therapies (two days or less). Call your veterinarian immediately if inter- nal bleeding is evident, diarrhea is per- sistent, or urination is labored. Herbs for Pets 172 r Materia Medica 173 r ROSEMARY Rosmarinus officinalis Mint Family Appearance: A creeping or erect shrub that can grow to 6 feet tall, rosemary is characterized by its piney fragrance; nar- row, leathery, and densely arranged opposite leaves; and white, pink, or blue 3⁄8-inch-long flowers. Habitat and Range: Rosemary is a native of the Mediterranean region, but several cultivars of rosemary are grown worldwide. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms anytime from early spring to late summer, depending on climate Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Tonic, antidepressant, stimulant, analgesic, expels intestinal gas, antispasmodic, pro- motes menstrual discharge, astringent, antioxidant, antimicrobial, insect repellent Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, digestive tract, circulatory system, respi- ratory tract, and skin Preparation: Tea, tincture Common Uses: Rosemary is an ex- tremely useful herb. At the top of its list of medicinal attributes are nervine, antidepressant, antispasmodic, and carminative properties that combine to make rosemary an excellent remedy for flatulent dyspepsia and other digestive problems that are secondary to general nervousness, excitability, or irritability. Adding to rosemary’s utility as a calm- ing agent are borneol and an assort- ment of volatile oils that are known to have antispasmodic effects upon the heart and other smooth muscles of the body. These activities not only help moderate cardiac arrhythmia but also serve to strengthen heart function, making rosemary especially beneficial in situations where an animal is recov- ering from a fearful or traumatic expe- rience, or even shock. The rosmarinic acid contained in the plant is believed to have painkilling properties. In any of the aforementioned instances, about 1⁄8 teaspoon (0.5 milliliter) of tincture can be given orally as a starting dose for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, up to three times daily. Horses and other large herbivores can be fed a handful of the fresh stems and leaves daily. In addition to its uses as a calming agent, rosemary can be employed as a general cardiovascular tonic, where it not only serves to moderate and Rosmarinus officinalis improve heart function but also helps to strengthen capillary structures. And when added to your companion’s food, rosemary helps mask the flavor of less- palatable herbs and serves as a natural barrier against food-borne bacteria. The ursolic acid and carnisol con- stituents of rosemary have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties that are effective against Pseudomonas fluo- rescens, Rhodoturula glutinius, and other pathogens that contribute to food spoilage. In fact, rosemary’s effec- tiveness is comparable to that of the more harmful chemical preservatives BHA or BHT. To use rosemary as a pre- servative, add 1⁄4 teaspoon of powdered herb to each pound of a dog’s or cat’s homemade diet. Rosemary also has excellent antimi- crobial properties inside or on your companion’s body. Scientific studies have shown that it is active against var- ious types of fungi, as well as numerous gram-positive and gram-negative bac- teria, including Staphylococcus albus, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli, Vibrio cholerae, and corynebacteria.6 This makes rosemary useful in antibacterial skin and eye rinses; for minor cuts and burns; and for fighting infections of the mouth, throat, and urinary and diges- tive tracts. Ten drops of rosemary essential oil can be diluted with 1 ounce of apricot kernel or almond oil for topical use in the treatment of sprains, arthritic joints, sciatica, and neuralgia. Rubbed into the skin at the site of discomfort, the oil stimulates capillary circulation and helps to relieve muscular and nerve pain. Do not use undiluted rosemary oil internally or externally, though, because it is strong and can cause immediate irritation. The oil is con- traindicated for animals who have any type of seizure disorder. Availability: Rosemary plants are available through nurseries. The dried or fresh herb is available at grocery and health food stores. Propagation and Harvest: Rose- mary is easy to grow from transplants and can be kept as a houseplant in areas where winters are severe. It’s not particular about soil and does best in full sun. In the southern and West Coast portions of the U.S., rosemary is often seen as a hedge-forming land- scape shrub, which, unfortunately, is unheard of in colder climates. Rosemary can be started from seed, but germination percentages are poor and the seedlings grow slowly. Rosemary can be harvested anytime, but the leaves’ medicinal qualities are strongest in late summer. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For depressive disorders or nervousness, rosemary can be combined with skull- cap or oatstraw. If such a problem is causing digestive disorders, such as vomiting, flatulence, and colic, look toward fennel, dill, flaxseed, parsley, or chamomile as an adjunct. For use as an antimicrobial, rosemary is strength- ened by Oregon grape. For topical first aid, rosemary oil combines with arnica, Saint-John’s-wort, cayenne, aloe, calendula, or willow bark. For itchy skin and fleas, rosemary and cal- endula combine as a soothing, healing flea-repellent rinse. Cautions and Comments: In horses, the volatile oils of rosemary may be detectable in a blood sample; is possible that it may be considered a “prohibited substance” under Jocky Club or other horse show rules. Otherwise, rosemary is a very safe herb. Herbs for Pets 174 r Materia Medica 175 s SAGE Salvia officinalis Mint Family Appearance: Over eight hundred species of Salvia exist worldwide, and most are medicinally useful. Most gar- deners and Epicureans are familiar with S. officinalis, common garden sage. Many of the wild species share the same unique “pebbled” leaf texture and have a similar but much stronger flavor and aroma. Flowers of the Salvia genus range from white to deep purple. It’s important to know that many wild plants with a sagelike fragrance, or even a common name that contains the word sage are unrelated to the sage we use in the kitchen. One example is sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata), a member of the sunflower family that smells like sage but can be harmful if used internally. Given the availability and effectiveness of culi- nary sage, there’s little reason to harvest wild sage for your companion. If, howev- er, you do opt to use a wild sage, learn its Latin name first. If the plant you are considering isn’t a Salvia, then it’s a dif- ferent medicine as well. Habitat and Range: Common sage is a native of the Mediterranean region. Dozens of cultivars have been developed and are farmed throughout the world. In the coastal canyons of southern California, native species such as white sage (S. apiana), black sage (S. mellifera), Munz’s sage (S. munzii), and purple sage (S. leucophylla) often stand as the pre- dominant flora, growing in dense stands of 2- to 6-foot-high shrubs that may cover the landscape for miles. As one travels north or east, the distribution of Salvia species becomes more scattered and less varied, and the plants tend to be small and less predominant. In the deserts of eastern Washington and Oregon, grayball sage (S. dorrii) brings the dry, brushy landscape alive with vibrant hues of purple. Cycle and Bloom Season: Perennials that bloom in early to late spring Parts Used: Leaves, small stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- septic, astringent, antispasmodic, expels intestinal gas, inhibits sweating (is an antihydrotic) Strongest Affinities: Mouth, digestive tract, skin Preparation: Tea or tincture Common Uses: Sage is an excellent remedy for infections or ulcerations of Salvia leucophylla the mouth, skin, or digestive tract. Most of its antimicrobial activity is attributable to its content of thujone, a volatile oil that is effective against E. coli, Shigella sonnei, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella ozanae, Bacillus subtillis, and various fungi— namely Candida albicans, Candida krusei, Candida pseudotropicalis, Torulopsis glab- rata, and Cryptococcus neoformans. A strong sage tea or tincture is useful for treating and preventing gingivitis as well as infection that is secondary to injury or dental surgery. For bacterial or fungal infections of the throat and digestive tract, sage serves as a safe and effective antibiotic and helps to expel gas and ease gastric cramping. Horses and other large herbivores can be fed a handful or two of the fresh leaves or a cup of dried leaves in their daily food ration as a treat- ment for colic and flatulence that is sec- ondary to bacterial or fungal infection. For smaller animals, the tea can be added to drinking water, or a tincture can be administered directly by mouth. If you choose to make tea, steep 1 table- spoon of the dried leaves in a cup of near-boiling water. Stir the mixture fre- quently until it has cooled to lukewarm. Strain out the plant material but don’t discard it if you’re treating a localized infection or ulcer. It can be used as a poultice by directly applying it to an affected area. The tea can be sweetened with honey (which has its own healing properties) and fed at a rate of 1 fluid ounce per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, two or three times daily. If you choose to use a tincture, a good starting dose is 0.5–1.0 milliliter per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily. In the form of a rinse, poultice, or fomentation, sage tea is useful for treat- ing bacterial or fungal infections of the skin, including ringworm. In such instances, thoroughly soak your com- panion with the cooled tea once or twice daily. The tea is also a safe and natural disinfectant for turtle or lizard enclosures and may be combined with liquid soap for use as a hand wash after handling animals who may carry salmonella. Availability: Fresh or dried sage is avail- able at food stores. The plants are avail- able at most nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Sage is an easy-to-grow “must have” for the home herb gardener. It likes heavy, slightly acid soil and full sun. It is drought resistant and winter hardy, but in regions where temperatures reach below –10° F, a thick fall mulch is required. Collect the leaves and small stems during midday, when the volatile oils are most concentrated in the leaves, and preferably when the plants are just beginning to bloom. The best way to dry sage is to tie the leaves into small bundles and hang them indoors. When the leaves are crunchy dry, they are ready to store in an airtight glass jar away from sunlight. Properly stored, the herb keeps for two or three years—as long as it smells strong, it’s still good medicine. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For mouth infections, thyme, rosemary, and bee balm are also effective, and consider Oregon grape and myrrh as strong adjuncts or alternatives. For digestive problems, sage combines with Oregon grape, licorice, fennel, parsley, dill, or marshmallow. For infec- tions of the skin, calendula, aloe, chap- arral, chamomile, rosemary, and uva ursi all deserve some study. Cautions and Comments: The undi- luted essential oil of sage can cause skin irritation and should not be given inter- nally. Sage is said to inhibit lactation. Herbs for Pets 176 s Materia Medica 177 s SAINT-JOHN’S-WORT Hypericum perforatum Saint-John’s-Wort Family Appearance: Saint-John’s-wort is a stur- dy perennial weed distinguished by its yellow five-petaled flowers and its small (up to 3⁄4 inch long) narrowly lance- shaped to elliptical leaves. The flowers and leaves are covered with tiny purplish black dots, each containing hypericin, a medicinally active compound that is often visible as a red stain on the skin after rubbing the foliage between one’s fingertips. Saint-John’s-wort varies in size among species, but all of them are simi- lar in appearance. The largest and most widespread species, Hypericum perfora- tum, may reach 32 inches in height, whereas H. anagalloides (bog Saint- John’s-wort), one of the smallest species, grows in mats seldom exceeding 4 inch- es in height. Habitat and Range: Habitat varies according to species, but generally the larger species prefer dry to moist open hillsides up to about 6,000 feet in eleva- tion, whereas higher elevations and wet- ter habitats tend to yield the smaller species. In the Pacific Northwest, H. per- foratum and H. formosum are common and often profuse on open range lands at foothill elevations, where they are considered noxious weeds because of their alleged toxicity to livestock. Saint- John’s-wort is a European import that now ranges throughout the Pacific and Rocky Mountain states and in isolated stands through the central and eastern portions of North America. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that is sometimes referred to as Fourth of July flower, Saint-John’s-wort usually blooms from early July through August. Parts Used: The top 12 inches of the flowering plant Primary Medicinal Activities: Wound healing, moderates nerve transmissions (nervine), antiseptic, antiviral, antide- pressive, immunostimulant. Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, skin Preparation: Tea, tincture, or topical preparation of the fresh herb Common Uses: It’s amazing how our opinions can change by simply looking closer at what we take for granted. Saint- John’s-wort has long been regarded as an invasive weed in the western portions of the U.S. Until recently, people wanted to eradicate this plant from the range lands on which it so successfully flourish- es, competes with native plants, and Hypericum perforatum threatens grazing livestock with possible toxic side effects. But now, in light of extensive scientific research, Saint- John’s-wort has been promoted from the status of a universally hated weed to that of a valued medicine that offers a wealth of curative power. Our awareness of Saint-John’s-wort’s benefits comes in the midst of an enormous health care crisis and forces us to reevaluate our short- sighted approaches to plants we igno- rantly view as our enemies. As well as giving us a valuable opportunity to reconsider the true values in our sur- roundings, Saint-John’s-wort offers new hope in the treatment of AIDS, chronic depression, nervous system disorders, and various forms of herpes virus. A plant is seen as a weed only when we cannot recognize its useful purpose. Because of the lesson we’ve learned from Saint- John’s-wort, we are forced to wonder about the usefulness of all plants and to consider the price we may be paying when we choose to eradicate certain plants in favor of agricultural economics. Saint-John’s-wort has received a great deal of media attention for its demon- strated ability to act as an antidepressant in both humans and animals. Literally hundreds of recent scientific studies have confirmed that it may act as a safe, effec- tive, and natural alternative to antide- pressant drugs. In Germany and other European countries, where the most research is being conducted on Saint- John’s-wort and its derivatives, the plant has been deemed safe and effective by the government, and millions of people are using the plant daily to treat chronic depression without ill side effects. In fact, one pharmaceutical brand of Saint- John’s-wort is being prescribed in Germany at a rate of seven to one over the popular antidepressant drug Prozac. And in the U.S., an increasing number of holistic veterinarians are using the herb to treat separation anxiety and aggres- sion disorders in dogs and cats. Contrary to popular belief, however, Saint-John’s- wort does not offer a neatly packaged holistic solution to depressive disorders, especially not for animals. The antidepressive qualities of Saint- John’s-wort represent only a small portion of what this plant has to offer. Saint- John’s-wort also has antiviral, vulnerary (wound and burn healing), nerve tonic, and antibacterial activities that are unpar- alleled by any other herb. And while a great deal of research and marketing has been focused on the hypericin con- stituents (a red pigment contained within tiny glands that dot the flower petals and leaves of the plant) of Saint-John’s-wort, this herb contains dozens of other chemi- cal compounds that have been shown to possess a tremendous range of healing actions. These compounds include vari- ous essential oils, flavonoids, tannins, and phytosterol constituents—all of which combine to make Saint-John’s-wort active against a wide variety of bacteria, fungi, and even viruses. For the treatment of burns and wounds, Saint-John’s-wort helps speed the healing process while reducing pain at the site of injury. As an antibiotic, preparations of Saint-John’s-wort ex- tract have been shown to be as effective as many of their pharmaceutical coun- terparts, including sulfonamides, a group of general-use antibiotics com- monly prescribed for treatment of bac- terial infections in dogs, cats, horses, and a wide variety of other animals. Saint-John’s-wort is especially useful in instances where soft tissues, joints, or nerve endings have been crushed, crimped, or bruised, a condition that may occur when a cattle dog is stomped or kicked or when a cat expends another of her nine lives in a run-in with an automobile. For first aid Herbs for Pets 178 s Materia Medica 179 s purposes, Saint-John’s-wort can be applied directly to the site of injury in the form of a salve, a tincture, or an oil infusion, or the tincture can be admin- istered internally. We would probably opt to do both in the described circum- stances as the topical application helps to prevent infection and speed healing, while the phytosterol and flavonoid constituents of the internal dose help with nerve pain and repair. Giving 12 drops of the tincture per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, administered twice daily, is a good starting point in terms of internal dosage. Saint-John’s-wort offers a great deal of promise in the treatment of various forms of viral and retroviral infections, including AIDS, FIV, Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, herpes, and viral hepatitis (particularly in ducks and other fowl). In essence, Saint-John’s-wort inhibits repro- duction of these viruses, especially if the herb is administered during the earliest stages of disease. In AIDS research, the hope is that Saint-John’s-wort will prove to slow the progression of the HIV virus. So far studies have been promising, but it’s too early to define the depth of Saint-John’s-wort’s role in this capacity. Regardless, its use in fighting human or feline AIDS is worth a serious try. Saint-John’s-wort extract may be effective as a preventive measure in dogs who have been exposed to a potentially fatal canine herpes viral infection or in cats, horses, or other animals suffering from a herpes virus. The point to remem- ber is that Saint-John’s-wort will not cure the animal of herpes, but it may help keep the virus in check. In our experi- ence with people who suffer from her- pes, simultaneous internal and external applications of Saint-John’s-wort extract expedites remission of the virus and often helps to lengthen the comfortable period between outbreaks. Availability: Saint-John’s-wort is a widely distributed weed in the western U.S. Seeds are available from specialty seed catalogs. The dried herb and its var- ious preparations are available through herb retailers. Propagation and Harvest: Saint- John’s-wort is easy to transplant or start from seed, but before you plant it, be aware that it is listed as a harmful weed in many areas of the country. If you introduce this plant into your herb gar- den, be careful that it doesn’t escape cul- tivation. Harvest when the plants are in full bloom, usually in early to mid-July. Clip off the flowering tops, and plan on making tincture or an oil infusion as quickly after harvest as possible—this plant is most effective if made into med- icine while it is fresh. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For anxi- ety and depressive disorders, lemon balm, skullcap, valerian, and passion- flower serve as adjuncts or alternatives. For injuries, Saint-John’s-wort combines well with comfrey, calendula, aloe, cayenne, yarrow, or arnica. Licorice, devil’s claw, or yucca root all serve as anti-inflammatory adjuncts. Consider oatstraw, skullcap, cayenne, and valer- ian as possible alternatives or adjuncts for nerve-related problems. As an antivi- ral or antiseptic, Saint-John’s-wort com- bines with echinacea, Oregon grape, certified organic goldenseal, bee balm, thyme, or sage. Cautions and Comments: Recent sci- entific studies have taught us that this herb may strengthen the effects of gen- eral anesthesia. Therefore, Saint-John’s- wort should not be used within 48 hours preceding surgery. While other adverse side effects are rare, some animals can develop a photosensitive rash from its use. Specifically, people or animals with light skin pigments may be susceptible to sunburnlike effects if they consume too much Saint-John’s-wort and subse- quently spend too much time in bright sunlight. This side effect has been observed in livestock who have foraged on large quantities of the plants and is one of the main reasons Saint-John’s- wort is the subject of herbicidal interven- tion in some areas of the West. Common sense should preside here—use extra caution if your animal has white hair, white or pink skin pigment, or a short coat. If a rash does develop, get the ani- mal out of direct sunlight and discontin- ue use of Saint-John’s-wort. Consider finding an alternative therapy—it may be that your animal is not a proper candi- date for Saint-John’s-wort. As always, it is a good idea to consult a holistic veteri- narian before diagnosing your pet’s con- dition and self-prescribing any course of therapy. SHEPHERD’S PURSE Capsella bursa-pastoris Mustard Family Appearance: Shepherd’s purse is a common lawn and vacant lot weed that begins its life as a ground-hugging rosette of 1- to 2-inch leaves that are hairy underneath and smooth on top. Later, the upper plant develops one or more slender, erect stems that can grow to about 20 inches tall. The lance-shaped leaves of the upper plant grow alternate- ly, clasping the stem at their bases. Small, white, inconspicuous flowers are presented at the top of the plant. The flowers develop into seed-bearing cap- sules that look like tiny (1⁄2 inch or small- er), pointed heart-shaped purses—a characteristic that likely earned the plant its common name. These little purses are two-celled, have a single ridge along one side, and are slightly concave along the other. Each cell contains tiny seeds. Many herbalists take the purse char- acteristics of shepherd’s purse for grant- ed and don’t look closely enough when identifying the plant before harvesting. Subsequently, many of them end up gathering and using the wrong plant. Although the impostor is usually another harmless member of the mustard family (Cruciferae), it is often medicinally use- less. The seed capsules of the look-alikes have two cells, but each cell contains only two seeds, whereas shepherd’s purse always has several seeds. Habitat and Range: Shepherd’s purse is a European import that is widely dis- tributed across North America. It is com- mon in cultivated fields, gardens, lawns, vacant lots, livestock grazing areas, and other disturbed areas. It can be found in almost any environment, from cracks in city streets to remote mountain camp- sites. It is adaptable to any elevation from below sea level to timberline. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual that continuously reseeds itself Parts Used: Entire plant, including roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Diuretic, astringent, stops bleeding, tonic Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract, joints Preparation: Tea, tincture, fresh or dried herb Common Uses: Shepherd’s purse is especially useful in cases of minor uri- nary system bleeding. The diuretic activity of this plant is strong enough to increase urinary volume and thus lower the concentration of acidic strong, dark urine, while its mild astringency helps Herbs for Pets 180 s Materia Medica 181 s to reduce inflammation in the bladder, urethra, and kidneys. Although it is a relatively weak diuretic, its low volatile oil content makes it a gentle alternative to oil-rich herbs such as parsley root, which are contraindicated in preexist- ing cases of kidney disease. Shepherd’s purse is indicated for arthritic condi- tions that are believed to be com- pounded by retention of excess sys- temic waste materials, where it is believed to help with the removal of fluid and various acid compounds from the joints. Studies have shown that the hemo- static activity of shepherd’s purse in the uterus and urinary tract is attributable to more than just simple tissue-shrink- ing astringency. The plant contains an assortment of amine and flavonoid con- stituents that are believed to actually strengthen capillaries and reduce their permeability. This makes shepherd’s purse an excellent urinary tonic for ani- mals who exhibit occasional blood in the urine as a result of structural anom- alies, scar tissue, or nonspecific atony of the bladder. It has also been found to enhance uterine tone, contract the uterine walls, and lower blood pressure, making it useful in postpartum bleeding and difficult placenta delivery. Externally, a poultice of the fresh plant can be applied to wounds to stop bleeding. A tincture, poultice, or water or oil infusion can be applied to the skin, as a weak alternative to mustard, to increase subcutaneous capillary cir- culation at the site of closed-tissue injuries and to help improve the strength and structure of capillaries. Availability: A widespread weed; avail- able through specialty seed catalogs Propagation and Harvest: Rather than buy dried shepherd’s purse at an herb store, it’s best to harvest your own fresh herb. The herb loses much of its medicinal potency when it dries and should be used or made into tincture as soon as it is harvested. This plant is easy to grow and spreads all over the garden if allowed. It grows in most soils but grows best in heavily manured soil, which is why it is so common in pas- tures. Harvest by pulling up the entire plant after the seed capsules have devel- oped but before the plant dries. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Shepherd’s purse can be combined with yarrow in fresh herb tea for bleeding fibroids or as an external first aid remedy (use the two herbs in a poultice). For arthritis, shep- herd’s purse combines with yucca root, boswellia, devil’s claw, licorice, or alfalfa. Dandelion leaf serves as a stronger, yet equally safe, diuretic. For urinary Capsella bursa-pastoris bleeding that is secondary to infection, combine with marshmallow, echinacea, and Oregon grape. Cautions and Comments: The authors have never witnessed any side effects from the use of this herb, but it has been theo- rized by others that Shepherd’s purse can cause contractions of the uterus and should not be administered to pregnant animals—reserve it for the postpartum period. It is also thought to have hemo- static properties that may interfere with blood-thinning drugs. Therefore, caution and common sense dictates that this herb is best avoided in animals with clot- ting disorders. SKULLCAP Scutellaria lateriflora Mint Family Appearance: Skullcap is differentiated from other mints by its blue or white flowers, which are borne (in most species) at the top third of the plant in symmetrically arranged sets of two or more. The flowers are two lobed and tubular; one lobe forms an upper lip, and one forms a larger apronlike lower lip. The lance-shaped, finely to coarsely toothed leaves oppose one another, as in all mints. Like most mints, skullcap has distinctly four-sided stems. Habitat and Range: Several native species of skullcap grow in North America, most of which live in moist meadows, seeps from springs, and ripar- ian thickets. Scutellaria lateriflora and several other cultivars are grown throughout the world. Cycle and Bloom Season: An annual or perennial (depending on species and climate) that blooms from June to August Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Mod- erates nerve transmissions, sedative, antispasmodic, anticonvulsant Strongest Affinities: Nervous system Preparation: Tea, tincture, dried or fresh herb Common Uses: For centuries, herbalists have recognized skullcap as one of the most effective herbal nervines available. It is commonly used for acute or chronic cases of nervous tension or anxiety and to help relieve pain from nerve-related injury or disease. Historically, it has been used to treat convulsions, epilepsy, mul- tiple sclerosis, hysteria, and delirium tremens, which is shaking and delirium associated with withdrawals from alco- hol (also called d.t.’s). Scutellaria lateriflo- ra is still known by many people as “mad dog weed” from its use in the eighteenth century as a cure for rabies. Yet despite its rich history and current popularity among herbalists, very little scientific study has been focused on this plant. From the studies that have been con- ducted, we have learned that the chem- istry of skullcap varies considerably between species, although all species that are marketed and used as herbal medicine contain scutellarin, a flavonoid compound that has been shown to possess sedative and antispasmodic qualities. We find skullcap especially effective for general nervousness and excitability in dogs and cats and for any condition characterized by oversensitivity of the peripheral nerves. It helps relieve nerv- ous tension related to pain or a traumat- ic experience, and it is useful as an anti- spasmodic in nervous irritations of the cerebrospinal system such as sciatica or posttraumatic neuralgia. Herbs for Pets 182 s Materia Medica 183 s Unlike valerian and other herbal seda- tives, skullcap by itself does not bring about drowsiness, nor does it dull the reflexes or interfere with motor coordi- nation. Instead, skullcap acts to moder- ate an animal’s responsiveness to physi- cal or nonphysical stimuli and helps to alleviate general restlessness and nervous twitching. This makes it suitable for high- strung felines who are recovering from a frightful experience but who need all of their survival mechanisms intact during their daily outdoor adventures. Herbalists consider skullcap a specific remedy for grand mal epileptic seizures. We have received several encouraging reports from people who are using skull- cap to reduce the severity and frequency of seizures in their epileptic dogs, espe- cially when the herb is combined in equal parts with valerian. Science has not yet revealed exactly how skullcap works in this capacity, but herbalists theorize that it may calm nerve impulses throughout the body, while inhibiting activity in higher brain centers where epileptic seizures might be triggered. Skullcap’s effectiveness in moderating epileptic episodes may explain its tradi- tional reputation as a cure for rabies: back in the eighteenth century, little was known about epilepsy, and it’s likely that many epilepsy sufferers were misdiag- nosed as having rabies. For epileptic dogs, 0.5 to 1 milliliter of a low-alcohol tincture can be fed two or three times daily, but see your holistic veterinarian for a thorough workup of your companion before proceeding. For generalized nervousness or to help relieve pain in dogs and cats, 0.5 milli- liter per 20 pounds of the animal’s weight can be fed as needed, up to three times daily for up to a week. It’s impor- tant to remember, though, that skullcap and other herbal sedatives can only relieve the symptoms of such disorders; they cannot address the underlying causes. For nervousness in a horse, mule, or goat, 1⁄2–1 ounce of the dried herb can be added to the animal’s feed once per day, as needed. A study in 1957 showed that skullcap can prevent a rise in serum cholesterol in animals on a high-cholesterol diet, which means that the herb might be useful as a dietary adjunct in animals, such as minia- ture schnauzers and beagles, who are predisposed to hyperlipidemia. Availability: Skullcap can be purchased through herb retailers in dried herb form or tinctures. The plants are available through nurseries that specialize in herbs. Propagation and Harvest: Easy to grow from transplants, skullcap likes consistently moist, rich soil and does Scutellaria lateriflora best when allowed a few hours of shade each day. Harvest the plants by clipping the upper third of the flowering plant. The plant can be hung in small bunches and dried for later use (the herb keeps for about a year), or the fresh herb can be made into tincture (the optimum choice). Alternatives and Adjuncts: For epi- leptic dogs or for use as a nerve-calming sedative, skullcap can be combined with an equal part of valerian. Oatstraw and gotu kola also serve as good adjuncts. For nerve pain and spinal injuries, com- bine skullcap with an equal amount of Saint-John’s-wort. Cautions and Comments: Some texts and many toxicology databases still claim that skullcap, when used in large quantities, can be damaging to the liver. However, in the years following the first writing of this book, we have learned that such claims are inaccurate. The reports of hepatotoxicity that fueled ear- lier controversies over the safety of this herb involved skullcap that had been adulterated with germander; an inex- pensive look alike that really can be dam- aging to the liver. Fortunately, the stan- dards by which skullcap is cultivated, processed, and analytically identified are better than ever, and safe, good quality skullcap is in ample supply. Just buy it from a reputable source. This is a very safe herb. SLIPPERY ELM Ulmus fulva Elm Family Appearance: Slippery elm is a decidu- ous tree that can grow to 80 feet tall. The outer bark is thick, furrowed, and pinkish brown. The broadly lance- shaped alternate leaves are 4–8 inches long and have toothed margins. The upper surfaces of the leaves feel like sticky sandpaper. Habitat and Range: Deciduous forests of the eastern half of the U.S. and Canada; slippery elm is at risk of endan- germent in many areas. Cycle and Bloom Season: The tree flow- ers from March to June and loses its leaves in the fall. Parts Used: Inner bark Primary Medicinal Activities: Lubri- cates, soothes, and protects internal mucous membranes; emollient, astringent, anti-inflammatory, nutritive Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, respiratory tract, skin Preparation: Tea, tincture, dried and powdered inner bark Common Uses: Slippery elm is best used in the digestive tract, where it serves as a soothing, protecting, and lubricating demulcent and a general astringent at the same time. These effects make slippery elm applicable in a wide variety of circumstances. For diar- rhea, enteritis, colitis, and irritations of the stomach, the tannin constituents of slippery elm tighten digestive mucosa to reduce inflammation and inhibit the entrance of excess fluids into the intes- tines. At the same time, the slippery, oily mucilage constituents of the herb help lubricate the digestive tract to assist in the elimination of waste. In cases of con- stipation, slippery elm soothes, protects, and lubricates mucous membranes, assisting and relaxing smooth muscles that have been working extra hard to eliminate waste. Higher up in the Herbs for Pets 184 s Materia Medica 185 s digestive tract, the mucilaginous astrin- gency of the herb lubricates and helps reduce inflammation in the throat, mak- ing swallowing easier and soothing a painful cough. It plays the same roles in the upper respiratory passages, where it relieves the discomforts of kennel cough and other types of bronchitis. Slippery elm is also nutritious; it was used as a food staple during times of economic hardship in Appalachia. It con- tains vitamins A, B complex, C, and K and high amounts of calcium, magne- sium, and sodium. The fresh inner bark has a slightly sweet pecanlike flavor and was often given to children as a treat to chew on (like chewing gum). It can be fed to convalescing animals as a nutri- tional digestive tonic—1 teaspoon of the dried inner bark steeped in 8 ounces of hot water to which 1 teaspoon of honey has been added. If constipation is a problem, 1 teaspoon of organic yogurt (a brand that has live cultures) can be added to the mixture. The entire mix- ture, inner bark and all, is then fed to the animals. Many animals will eat this for- mula in the absence of anything else, and it is useful for a wide variety of diges- tive or respiratory problems in dogs and cats. If your companion cannot tolerate honey because of diabetes, allergies, or other problems, eliminate honey from the recipe. If your companion won’t eat the bark, strain the fluid through a fine sieve and pour it onto her food. A glyc- erin-based tincture is also effective and offers the convenience of administering a squirt or two into the mouth. A good starting dose for the tincture is 1⁄4–1⁄2 tea- spoon (1–2 milliliters) for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, once or twice daily. On the skin, a poultice of slippery elm bark can be applied to wounds, ulcers, boils, or abscesses. In essence, it is used the same way as plantain (Plantago sp.), a common weed that is better suited for this purpose because of its abundance and resilience to human impact. Availability: Available at herb retailers. When you buy slippery elm bark, make sure that you’re getting the inner bark only. The powder or bark should be light, fluffy, and pale pinkish tan in color. If it has darker flecks in it or appears corky, stringy, or woody, it was probably carelessly harvested and the inner bark was not separated from the outer bark. Inclusion of the outer bark dramatically changes the nature of the medicine. The outer bark contains a greater amount of tannin constituents, which may cause digestive or urinary tract irritation. Propagation and Harvest: Slippery elm is available through nurseries that specialize in native plants. This tree is not Ulmus fulva difficult to grow, but, like most trees, it grows slowly. If you have room for one of these beautiful shade trees, by all means plant one! You will be doing a dwindling species a great favor. Alternatives and Adjuncts: Slippery elm has remained quite popular among herb users for centuries. Unfortunately, many of its consumers remain unaware of its declining population in the wild. Slippery elm is being overharvested, and many of the trees are succumbing to Dutch elm disease—a fungal infection that kills trees. Adding to these problems are careless methods by which much of the bark is harvested: the entire tree, which may be one hundred years old, is cut down, stripped of its bark, then used as firewood or hardwood lumber with lit- tle regard to sustenance of the species. All in all, consumer demand is currently outstripping natural supply. We include slippery elm here so that you know to use this herb conservative- ly, respectfully, and in a proper therapeu- tic context. Slippery elm should be reserved for circumstances where alter- natives are ineffective, and every effort should be made to support the tree’s cul- tivation and conservation in the wild. Fortunately, some effective and accessi- ble alternatives exist for slippery elm. In many instances, slippery elm can be sub- stituted with the common weed plantain (Plantago sp.). If a more mucilaginous remedy is needed, marshmallow root (Althea officinalis) is an excellent alterna- tive, especially when it is combined with an astringent such as goldenrod or rasp- berry leaf, or a tincture or decoction of uva ursi or juniper. Cautions and Comments: With the rare exception of possible allergic reac- tions, slippery elm is generally safe for animals. The outer bark, however, (which shouldn’t be in the slippery elm you buy) can cause irritation to the digestive and urinary tracts and may induce abortion in pregnant animals. THYME Thymus vulgaris Mint Family Appearance: Most species of thyme are ground-hugging plants with strong sprawling stems, small (1⁄8 inch) opposite leaves, and tiny cylindrical flowers that range in color from white to pale purple. There are countless variations of leaf color, fragrance, and even flavor avail- able to the gardener. In fact there are so many variations of Thymus spp., it is pos- sible to dedicate an entire garden to them. Habitat and Range: Thyme originated in the Mediterranean region. Over 350 species of Thymus exist worldwide most of which are cultivated as a seasoning herb or landscape shrub. Cycle and Bloom Season: Most of the species of thyme are evergreen perenni- als. Blooming occurs from early spring to midsummer. Parts Used: Leaves, stems, and flowers Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- microbial, expels intestinal gas, antispas- modic, cough suppressant, expectorant, astringent, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Digestive and respiratory tracts Preparation: Tea or tincture Common Uses: Most of thyme’s medic- inal activity is attributable to its volatile oil constituents, which are thymol and Herbs for Pets 186 t carvacrol. Thymol is a good antiseptic for the mouth and throat and is useful for fighting gingivitis in dogs and cats. In fact, it is used as the active ingredient in many commercial toothpaste and mouthwash formulas. Combined with thyme’s infection- fighting qualities are cough suppressant and expectorant properties, which make the herb effective against raspy, unpro- ductive coughs that are secondary to fungal or bacterial infection. As an anti- spasmodic, thyme helps to ease bronchial spasms related to asthma. A glycerin tincture, or an alcohol tincture that has been sweetened with honey, serves well for most internal applica- tions—1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) for each 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight (12–20 drops for cats), fed to the animal as needed up to twice daily. A cooled tea works too, provided it has been brewed with near-boiling water to draw out the volatile oil constituents—1 teaspoon per 30 pounds of body weight for dogs, 1⁄4 teaspoon for cats, fed directly into the mouth two to three times daily. For infections of the mouth or as a preventa- tive against gingivitis, the tincture or a strong tea can be directly applied to the gum lines or infected sites with a swab. In the digestive tract, it is a useful carmi- native and antispasmodic in cases of dys- pepsia, irritable bowel, and colitis. It also helps expel parasites, especially hook- worms. In these cases, the dried or fresh herb can be fed with your companion’s food—1 teaspoon per pound of food fed to dogs, a sprinkling for cats. Horses and other large herbivores with digestive problems can be fed a 1⁄2 cup of the dried herb or a handful of the fresh plants daily. Rabbits, birds, and other small ani- mals can be fed a couple of fresh sprigs daily. On the surface of the body, thyme tea (skin rinse) or an oil infusion is appro- priate for various fungal or bacterial infections of the skin. In the urinary tract, the tea or tincture serves as an antimicro- bial as well as a mildly astringent tonic that is said to treat urinary incontinence. Use the tincture doses we have suggest- ed for respiratory problems. Availability: Thyme can be purchased at any food market. The plants are avail- able at nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Thyme is easy to grow from seeds or transplants. It prefers light soil with neutral acidity but can be grown just about anywhere. It is an excellent choice for rock gardens and walkway borders. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For infec- tions of the mouth, thyme combines with myrrh, Oregon grape, certified organic goldenseal, bee balm, or sage. Materia Medica 187 t Thymus vulgaris For respiratory infections, combine with garlic, echinacea, bee balm, or sage. For asthma, thyme works best when used in conjunction with elecampane, mullein leaf, nettle, or lobelia. For digestive prob- lems, fennel, parsley seeds, chamomile, and peppermint are all good herbs to combine with thyme. For worms, try combining thyme with equal amounts of garlic and raw pumpkin seeds. Cautions and Comments: Thyme is safe, but when it’s ingested in large amounts, it has been known to affect menstrual cycles. Therefore, it should be used with moderation in pregnant animals. When isolated from the rest of the plant, thymol is toxic. Do not use an essential oil of thyme in or on your animal. In horses, the volatile oils of thyme may be detectable in a blood sample, and it may be considered a “prohibited substance” under Jockey Club or other horse show rules. UVA URSI Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Heath Family Appearance: Also known as kinnikin- nick (an American Indian word meaning “smoking mixture”), uva ursi is a mat- forming, densely branched ground cover with woody trailing stems. Several other species of Arctostaphylos are small to medium (up to 10 feet tall) erect hard- wood shrubs. In mountainous areas of the southwestern U.S., A. manzanita is often seen as a predominant shrub. Despite their size differences, all species present leaf, flower, and fruit characteris- tics that distinguish them as members of the Arctostaphylos genus, and all are medicinally useful despite the fact that A. uva-ursi is the species of primary interest among herbalists. The leathery leaves are spoon to lance shaped, with upper sur- faces darker green than their undersides. Flowers are pink and urn shaped, and they are arranged in nodding, few-flow- ered terminal clusters. The fruits are mealy red berries that look like tiny apples. Habitat and Range: Open forest clear- ings from the montane zone up to the timberline. Arctostaphylos uva-ursi is the predominant species, ranging through- out the northern third of the U.S., Canada, and Europe. In the mountains of Washington, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and especially California (where A. manzanita is pro- tected by law), several of the larger shrub varieties are predominant. Cycle and Bloom Season: Blooms April through June. Fruits begin to develop in midsummer. Parts Used: Leaves and twigs Primary Medicinal Activities: Astrin- gent, antimicrobial, diuretic Strongest Affinities: Urinary tract and skin Preparation: Decoction or tincture Common Uses: Uva ursi contains a con- siderable amount of tannins (up to 40 percent), making it one of nature’s most powerful astringents. It also contains hydroquinones—an assortment of chem- ical compounds that are active against a wide variety of pathogens, including Mycobacterium smegmatis, Staphylo- coccus aureus, Bacillus subtilus, E. coli, and various Shigella species. Each of these pathogens are often implicated in uri- nary tract infections. It’s important to Herbs for Pets 188 u know, however, that for uva ursi to be an effective treatment for urinary tract infections, an alkaline reaction is neces- sary to release the hydroquinone into an active form. This means that uva ursi cannot contribute antibacterial activities to a urinary system in which urine is acidic, a condition that is common in animals, especially cats, with chronic uri- nary tract problems. In these circum- stances, it is necessary either to elevate urine pH into a healthier alkaline state or to combine uva ursi with other antibac- terial herbs (the easier option). Regardless of urine pH, uva ursi serves as an effective astringent to stop bleeding and reduce urinary tract inflammation. Uva ursi is a strong herb, and its high tannin content can irritate the kidneys if used for more than a few consecutive days. Therefore, it is best reserved for sit- uations in which quick intervention is needed. To use uva ursi internally, make a decoction from the fresh or dried leaves and stems. Use 1 cup of the dried herb for each 3 cups of water. The leathery, almost plasticlike struc- ture of this plant makes it nearly imper- vious to water, so a simple tea is not an option. For dogs, 1 teaspoon of the cooled decoction can be fed once daily for no more than three days. Cats and ferrets require only 1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon. Have the animal drink as much water as pos- sible when using this herb, even if you must resort to using a meat broth. The idea is to course the herb through the urinary tract so it can quickly alleviate infection and reduce inflammation. Then, after a day or two, gentler astrin- gent herbs can be used to finish the therapy safely and effectively. Horses and other large herbivores can be fed 1 cup of the dried leaves daily for up to three days. For contact dermatitis, seb- orrhea, and fleabites, the decoction can be diluted (1 cup decoction to 1 quart of water) and used as an antibacterial and astringent skin rinse. Availability: Uva ursi is available through herb retailers. The plants are available through nurseries that special- ize in native plant landscaping. Propagation and Harvest: Uva ursi is hardy northward to central Canada and serves as an excellent antierosion ground cover. It’s not particular about soil but prefers slightly to moderately acid conditions. Uva ursi and other members of the Arctostaphylos genus are especially good landscape choices in mountain areas of the western United States and Canada. The leaves and trailing stems can be clipped, dried, and used anytime during their evergreen growth. Materia Medica 189 u Arctostaphylos uva-ursi Alternatives and Adjuncts: When treating most forms of urinary tract infection, it’s a good idea to help flush the animal’s system with the use of diuretic herbs. Dandelion leaf, chick- weed, cleavers, or shepherd’s purse serves this purpose well. For animals with overly concentrated acidic urine, uva ursi can be preceded (by an hour or so) by a dose of mullein leaf tea, which is moder- ately effective at alkalinizing the urine. Uva ursi also can be combined with antimicrobials such as Oregon grape, sage, thyme, or echinacea. Marshmallow serves as a soothing and lubricating adjunct in urinary tract therapies and is especially useful in the passage of stones and gravel. Corn silk, couch grass, horse- tail, raspberry leaf, and cleavers all serve as weaker urinary astringents that are suitable for minor to moderately severe urinary ailments. Cautions and Comments: Uva ursi is believed to inhibit oxygen delivery to the uterus and therefore should not be used in pregnant animals. Like all strong astringents, long-term internal use of uva ursi may irritate the kidneys, bladder, and urethra. Uva ursi may be contraindi- cated in cases of preexisting kidney inflammation or renal failure. See your veterinarian in these circumstances. VALERIAN Valeriana officinalis Valerian Family Appearance: Many people relate the strongly aromatic roots of valerian to the odor of dirty gym socks. Once you have experienced the odor of this plant, identi- fication becomes as simple as probing a finger into the soil to scratch a root. The foliage of this plant is unique as well—the plant first emerges as a cluster of loosely arranged lance-shaped leaves that usually remain larger than the leaves of the mature upper plant. Upper leaves are divided and become progressively smaller toward the top of the plant. Flowers are borne in branched clusters of small white to pink blossoms at the top of the plant. Roots are stringy, brown, and pungent. Several native species of Valeriana occur throughout North America, with size being the primary difference among species. Most wild valerians remain under a foot in height, while domestic valerian can grow in excess of 5 feet tall. Habitat and Range: Valerian is gener- ally found in soils that retain moisture well into summer. Look for it on north- facing banks or hillsides or in partially shaded soils that are high in organic matter. Several native species occur throughout the western third of the U.S. and Canada. It is less common in the midwestern and eastern portions of North America, but in some areas, espe- cially in New England, V. officinalis has escaped cultivation and is thriving. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms from May to July Parts Used: Primarily the fall root. The upper parts of the plant are useful, too, but make weaker medicine. Primary Medicinal Activities: Sedative, antispasmodic, anticonvulsive, expels intes- tinal gas, lowers blood pressure Strongest Affinities: Nervous system, digestive tract Preparation: Tincture, tea, fresh or dried root Common Uses: Valerian is without doubt the most widely recognized herbal sedative. As a sedative, valerian Herbs for Pets 190 v works safely and gently to help calm the nerves and achieve physical relaxation. It does not induce an altered state like one would expect from a prescription sedative or from consumption of alco- hol. Contrary to what many people believe, valerian is not a precursor of the tranquilizer Valium. Valium is the brand name for diazepam, a prescrip- tion drug that shares no chemical rela- tionship with valerian. Herbalists use valerian for insomnia and nervous anxiety and to help the body relax in the presence of physical pain. It is useful in calming animals dur- ing thunderstorms and on trips to the vet or groomer or to help your compan- ion rest after surgery. For epileptic ani- mals, it sometimes helps to reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. Animal studies have concluded that valerenic and valerenal acid work simi- larly to the drug phenobarbital, a cen- tral nervous system depressant that is used as an anticonvulsive. And the herb has been shown to inhibit production of an enzyme that breaks down gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA), an amino acid that is responsible for inhibiting and regulating neurotransmissions in the brain. The theory is this: by prevent- ing the breakdown of GABA with valer- ian, the increased neural activity that precedes an epileptic seizure is circum- vented, and the triggering mechanism is disabled. When employed as a sedative, valerian is most effective when small doses are fed several times daily over a period of sever- al days. This is especially true when it is used in anticipation of a high-anxiety event, such as a planned interstate trip or a show. In these circumstances, dogs can be fed 5 drops of the tincture three or four times daily, starting three days prior to the event. Cats need only 1 or 3 drops two or three times daily. In the digestive tract, valerian is a useful antispasmodic for situations in which nervousness is compounded by a spastic colon or an upset stomach. But because of valerian’s soaplike content, large amounts of this herb may cause nausea and vomiting. For digestive and antiepileptic uses, 0.25–0.5 milliliter of the tincture can be fed for each 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight two to three times daily. In horses, valerian helps to reduce anxiety and nervous- ness without inducing drowsiness or affecting physical performance. Add 1⁄2 ounce of the dried and chopped herb or 2 tablespoons of the tincture to the horse’s daily feed. For reasons that remain a mystery, a small percentage of human or animal subjects experience completely opposite effects from valerian—it acts as a stimu- lant rather than a sedative. Materia Medica 191 v Valeriana officinalis Availability: Various forms of valerian preparations are available through herb retailers. Plants are available through nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Valerian can be grown from seeds or transplants. It likes rich, consistently moist soil and full sun or partial shade. It is best to plant valerian early in the spring, when the seedlings and young plants can fully benefit from cool temperatures and precipitation. The roots are dug in late fall of the second year of growth. The fresh roots can be made into tincture or they can be chopped and dried for later use. When properly stored in plastic bags, the dried roots keep for up to three years. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For epilep- tic animals, valerian combines well with skullcap. For anxiety and nervousness, valerian can be combined with skullcap, passionflower, hop, oatstraw, or catnip. These herbs also serve as alternatives for animals who have an opposite response to valerian. Cautions and Comments: Valerian can cause digestive upset if used in large doses, and it should not be used in preg- nant animals. Otherwise, it is a safe herb. WORMWOOD Artemesia absinthum Sunflower Family Appearance: Wormwood is attractive to the eyes and intriguing to the nose. It has silky, finely divided, gray-green leaves and a strong fragrance that is rem- iniscent of both sage and pine. The tiny yellow ball-like flowers of the plant are presented in loose clusters on the upper branches of the plant. The entire plant may grow to the size of a small bush up to 4 feet tall. Habitat and Range: A native of Europe, wormwood is cultivated as a garden plant throughout the Northern Hemisphere and has found its way into wild areas throughout most of North America. It is most commonly found along roadways, in vacant lots, on the edges of cultivated fields, and in other waste areas. Cycle and Bloom Season: A long-lived perennial that blooms from June to August Parts Used: Leaves Primary Medicinal Activities: Anti- septic, antifungal, astringent, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Skin and diges- tive tract Preparation: Tea or dried leaves Common Uses: As its common name implies, wormwood is among the most well-known herbal worming agents. Hundreds of years of successful use stand in testament to its ability to expel tape- worms, threadworms, and especially roundworms from the intestinal tracts of dogs, cats, horses, goats, sheep, cattle, and humans. We seldom use it, however. Although wormwood makes life miser- able for intestinal parasites, it can also be hard on the host. This is because worm- wood contains an assortment of strong volatile oils, bitter principles, and tannins. If used excessively, these constituents can be irritating to the liver and kidneys, and in extreme cases may even damage the nervous system. This is not to say that wormwood can’t be used safely, but an extra measure of care and moderation is certainly warranted. The problems with Herbs for Pets 192 W using wormwood are multifaceted: too small a dose is ineffective, but a larger dose might be toxic. Small doses admin- istered over a long period might be effec- tive, but at what cumulative cost to the animal’s kidneys, liver, and nervous sys- tem? Our conclusion is this: wormwood is useful when the absolute necessity of quick parasite intervention outweighs the risk of toxicity. In holistic animal care, this circumstance is a rarity because thera- peutic focus is placed upon the whole ani- mal, not just one or more symptoms of disease. To use wormwood, up to 1⁄4 teaspoon of the dried powdered herb or about 1⁄8 teaspoon (0.5 milliliter) of a low-alcohol tincture can be administered daily at mealtime for each 30 pounds of a dog’s body weight. Cats can receive up to 1⁄8 teaspoon daily. Do not administer worm- wood internally for more than three con- secutive days. Wormwood has an extremely bitter flavor, making it a diffi- cult herb to use. To ease the process of getting it into a hissing cat or tight-lipped dog, the powder or tincture can be placed in a small gel capsule and wrapped with cheese, meat, or other special treat. Externally, wormwood is an effective skin rinse (see chapter 1) for bacterial or fungal infections of the skin, including various forms of dermatophytosis. Availability: Wormwood is available through herb retailers. Plants and seeds are available from nurseries that specialize in herbs. Propagation and Harvest: Wormwood is easy to grow, requiring average soil, full sunlight, and only occasional watering. It is hardy northward to central Canada, and plants often live in excess of ten years. The leaves can be harvested anytime, but they are most potent when gathered on a hot summer afternoon. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For intes- tinal parasites, garlic, pumpkin seeds, black walnut hulls, sage, thyme, and Oregon grape all serve as effective and safer substitutes. For infections of the skin, wormwood combines with calendula, gotu kola, or aloe. Sage serves similar pur- poses as a topical antimicrobial. Cautions and Comments: The volatile oil thujone, which may be present in alco- hol extractions of this plant, can be dam- aging to the liver, kidneys, and nervous system if used excessively. Alcohol prepa- rations of this herb should never be used in animals who suffer from seizures, kidney problems, or liver disease. Wormwood is generally safe when used in dried herb form, or when prepared without alcohol in the form of water infusions (teas) or as a glycerite. However, all forms are best avoided in pregnant or lactating animals. Materia Medica 193 W Artemesia absinthum YARROW Achillea millefolium Sunflower Family Appearance: Yarrow is characterized by its flat-topped terminal clusters of small white to pinkish white flowers and its alternate, finely dissected, featherlike leaves (millefolium translates to “thou- sand-leafed”). The entire plant is strong- ly aromatic, with a pungency much like that of mothballs. Stems are often wool- ly haired. Several cultivars of yarrow have been developed for the floral industry, and many have escaped cultivation. These plants are usually not as cold hardy as their wild cousins and can be identified by their yellow, peach, or red flowers. Habitat and Range: Yarrow is a native of Asia that has made itself at home throughout the northern hemisphere from sea level to above the timberline. The den- sity of plant populations increases as one travels north through the western U.S. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that often remains in bloom throughout the spring and summer Parts Used: Flowers, leaves, and stems Primary Medicinal Activities: Antiseptic, analgesic, dilates blood ves- sels, promotes sweating, expectorant, anti-inflammatory, stops bleeding, tonic, lowers blood pressure, fever reducing (febrifuge), insect repellent, expels worms Strongest Affinities: Circulatory and respiratory systems, urinary and diges- tive tracts, skin Preparation: Dry or fresh herb, tea, tincture, or oil infusion Common Uses: Yarrow is one of the most versatile and well-known herbs in nature’s apothecary. In ancient Europe, yarrow was known as “wound wort” by warriors who used the plant (presumably for their horses as well as themselves) to stop bleeding and disinfect wounds on the battlefield. The genus name, Achillea, is derived from the name of the ancient Greek warrior Achilles. The powder or poultice of the dried or fresh plant is useful for treating less deliberate open wounds such as a barbed wire cut or a foot pad laceration caused by a broken bottle. To effectively stop bleeding and inhibit bacteria, sim- ply crush the herb as finely as possible and apply it directly to the wound. A cooled tea of the plant can be used as a pain- and itch-relieving antiseptic skin rinse, and the aromatic nature of the plant may be of help in repelling fleas, mosquitoes, and biting flies. Yarrow is a unique peripheral vasodilator and vascular tonic. When taken internally, the flavonoid con- stituents of yarrow act to dilate and strengthen peripheral blood vessels and help clear away small blood clots, thus increasing circulation to the skin and extremities. Combined with this are anti- inflammatory qualities, making yarrow helpful for problems such as arthritis, navicular syndrome in horses, and severe cases of dermatitis in which peripheral circulation has been impaired by inflam- mation. It is also useful for subcutaneous blood clots of the ears and the skin, especially when internal doses of the tincture are used simultaneously with external applications of an oil infusion. In the urinary tract, a yarrow tea or tincture serves as a bacteriostatic agent in the treatment of chronic or acute cys- titis. It is useful in the early stage of a kid- ney infection. In the lungs, yarrow’s bac- teriostatic and expectorant properties Herbs for Pets 194 y help the body in its effort to eliminate invading microbes and other foreign bodies. At the same time, the herb dilates and tonifies respiratory blood ves- sels to improve pulmonary efficiency. Because of this remarkable combination of activities, yarrow is among the first herbs we reach for in cases of pneumo- nia. Yarrow also may be beneficial for racehorses who suffer from hemorrhagic pulmonary edema (bleeding from the respiratory tract) as a result of too much strenuous exercise. In the digestive tract, yarrow is mar- ginally effective at expelling worms and is useful for inflammations, bleeding, and bacterial infections of the stomach and colon. The bitter principles stimu- late digestion and appetite. And yarrow is well known among herbalists as a fever-reducing remedy. It is especially effective when taken as a tea at the onset of a fever. Scientists once thought that yarrow’s therapeutic qualities were chiefly attrib- utable to tannins and a volatile oil called azulene. The chemical makeup of yarrow is extremely complex, however, and recent studies have found that the plant contains sterols and various other com- pounds that possess a much wider range of medicinal activities than originally thought. One study suggests that yarrow may be a useful antitumor agent and may play an active role in the treatment of certain types of leukemia. To use yarrow internally in dogs and cats, a tincture is usually preferable over a tea because the herb is bitter and hard to feed in appreciable quantities. For dogs, about 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) of the tincture can be fed for each 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight, two to three times daily. Cats and similar- sized animals need only 1⁄8 teaspoon twice daily. Horses and other large herbi- vores can be allowed to eat the plants from their pastures as they wish, or they can be fed 1 ounce of the dried herb as part of their daily ration. Availability: Yarrow is a widely distrib- uted weed that is also available through herb retailers and nurseries. Propagation and Harvest: Yarrow is easy to grow from seed or transplants. True yarrow (A. millefolium) is hardy down to at least -30° F and is drought tolerant as well. The yellow and hybrid varieties (of which there are several col- ors) are less hardy but are still easy to grow in most areas of North America. Moderately rich, slightly acid soil and full sun yields healthy plants, which usually don’t bloom until their second year of growth. Harvest the upper third of the flowering plant (stems, leaves, and flow- ers) in midsummer on a dry, warm day— Materia Medica 195 y Achillea millefolium this is when the highest concentration of active constituents are found in the plant. Alternatives and Adjuncts: To stop bleeding, nothing compares with a first aid powder made from a fifty-fifty mix of dried yarrow and cayenne. For situations requiring a vascular tonic or peripheral vasodilator, yarrow combines well with garlic, cayenne, ginkgo, hawthorn, or ginger. For urinary tract infections, marsh- mallow, couch grass, horsetail, echi- nacea, and Oregon grape combine well with yarrow. For infections of the diges- tive tract, combine yarrow with Oregon grape. For topical treatment of inflam- mations and infections of the skin, con- sider sage, rosemary, calendula, chamomile, and juniper as adjuncts or alternatives. For topical treatment of closed injuries, yarrow combines espe- cially well with arnica. Cautions and Comments: Allergic reactions to yarrow are fairly common, and the volatile oils of the plant may cause dermatitis when they are applied to the skin of sensitive animals. This plant contains thujone, a substance that is poorly water soluble but may be present in alcohol extractions of the herb. Any herb preparation that contains apprecia- ble amounts of thujone has a potential of being toxic, especially if large quantities are consumed over an extended period of time (meaning that moderation is the key to safe long-term use). Like most herbs that are rich with volatile oils, yarrow should be used with caution in pregnant or lactating animals, as these constituents have been shown to cross the placenta to the fetus and are known to have stimulant effects upon the uterus if they are ingested in sufficiently large quantities. YELLOW DOCK Rumex crispus Buckwheat Family Appearance: Yellow dock is a hearty perennial that may grow up to 5 feet. The elongated lance-shaped leaves at the base of the plant grow up to 12 inch- es long and 4 inches wide. The leaves are often curled at their margins (hence another common name for the plant: curly dock). The alternate stem leaves are smaller but more numerous. The sin- gle stout stem is often red and bears long clusters of small, greenish white flowers above the rest of the plant. As the flowers mature and dry, they turn a rust-red color that often stands in bold contrast to the surrounding flora. Habitat and Range: Widely distrib- uted in disturbed areas throughout North America. The entire Rumex genus is imported from Europe. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial that blooms May through August Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Stim- ulates bile production, helps with blood cleansing, laxative, antimicro- bial, nutritive Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, skin, and liver Preparation: Tincture, tea, and dried root Common Uses: Yellow dock is well described as a quick-cleansing herb. The root contains a combination of anthraquinone, small amounts of oxalic acid and oxalates, and other con- stituents that stimulate liver function Herbs for Pets 196 y and contractions of intestinal smooth muscles (peristalsis). In effect, the body is prompted to work harder at eliminat- ing waste from the bloodstream and digestive tract. This makes yellow dock especially useful for treating chronic or acute dermatitis that may be attribut- able to toxic excesses and elimination deficiencies in the body. It is also bene- ficial in treating rheumatoid arthritis that is secondary to similar circum- stances. Because of its ability to quickly flush the body of systemic waste, yellow dock is sometimes used in the herbal treatment of cancer. Because the root is extremely high in iron, it is considered a traditional remedy for anemia. Yellow dock is effective when used within the parameters we have just described. It is somewhat of a “heroic remedy,” an herb that forces quick, dra- matic responses in the body, much like an allopathic drug. Therefore, its use in the holistic care of animals should be limited to short-term applications at the onset of detoxification therapies that are focused on long-term holistic results. Alternatively, it can be used as a potentiating adjunct in combination with tonic herbs such as burdock, dan- delion, red clover, slippery elm, and alfalfa. Using yellow dock as a sympto- matic quick fix (such as for constipa- tion) amounts to little more than substi- tuting an herb for a drug. Externally, yellow dock can be used as an itch-relieving, alterative skin rinse or poultice in the treatment of skin dis- orders such as seborrhea, pyoderma, and contact dermatitis. To use yellow dock internally, consult your holistic veterinarian. Availability: A widely distributed weed. Available through herb retailers and seed catalogs that specialize in medicinal plants. Propagation and Harvest: Yellow dock is easy to grow once it’s estab- lished, but the seeds can remain dor- mant in the soil for several years before germinating. However, the plants grow in just about any soil and need little care. The roots are dug in fall after the plant has gone to seed and the leaves have begun to die back for winter. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For situ- ations that require stimulation of the liver, consider dandelion root and Oregon grape as less “heroic” alterna- tives. For anemia, yellow dock com- bines well, in proportionately small amounts, with alfalfa, garlic, red clover, spirulina, and nettle. Cautions and Comments: Even though yellow dock is a much gentler laxative than most herbs that contain Materia Medica 197 y Rumex crispus considerable amounts of anthra- quinones, yellow dock should not be used in situations involving either intes- tinal bleeding or preexisting obstruc- tions such as intestinal tumors. When it is used in moderation, yellow dock is quite safe, but excessive use of the herb is likely to result in intestinal cramping, diarrhea, and vomiting, and it may lead to laxative dependency. Like all stimu- lant laxatives, yellow dock should not be used during pregnancy. YUCCA Yucca schidigera Lily Family Appearance: Although argument exists among botanists over yucca’s specific family classification, yucca is not a cactus. Essentially, “old scholars” consider yucca a member of Agavaceae, the agave fami- ly, while current botanists refer to yucca as a member of Liliaceae, the Lily family. We opt for the latter. Once you see yucca’s beautiful cream-colored flower clusters, you will likely agree that it’s a lily. The showy 1- to 3-inch flowers are presented in dense clusters atop a proportionately tall central stalk. The rest of the plant is characterized by its sharply pointed, swordlike leaves. The various species differ primarily by their size, but the most distinguishable of them is Y. brevifolia, commonly called Joshua tree, which grows up to 20 feet tall. This large yucca is an inhabitant of the high southwestern deserts of Arizona, Nevada, western New Mexico, and especially California, where it is pro- tected by law. Most yucca species, how- ever, share similar appearances with Y. schidigera (Mojave yucca), a long-leafed variety that grows as a 1- to 6-foot-high clump of pain-inflicting puncturing green swords. Habitat and Range: Yucca schidig- era’s natural habitats are the dry coastal canyons of California and the inland deserts of the western U.S. This is the primary variety of commerce, and it is widely harvested and market- ed by the natural products and land- scape industries. Several other species of yucca range throughout the deserts and plains of North America. Although most of us associate plants such as yucca with hot, dry desert environments, the true defini- tion of desert pertains only to rainfall lim- itations, and various species of yucca have adapted to dramatically contrasting temperatures. For example, Y. glauca (small soapweed) thrives in many areas of the northern plains states and Canada, where summers are excruciatingly hot and dry, but winters are subarctic in average temperature. Cycle and Bloom Season: A perennial, yucca’s bloom frequency and duration depend largely on available precipita- tion. Cultivated plants may bloom once every one to three years, while wild plants may remain dormant for decades. Parts Used: Roots Primary Medicinal Activities: Nutritive, anti-inflammatory, and antitumor Strongest Affinities: Digestive tract, musculoskeletal system Preparation: Chopped and dried herb or tincture Common Uses: Yucca contains notable quantities of vitamin C, beta-carotene, calcium, iron, magnesium, manganese, niacin, phosphorus, protein, and B vita- mins, but its greater healing powers are chiefly attributable to its impressive con- Herbs for Pets 198 y Materia Medica 199 tent of saponin compounds. Saponins are a group of soaplike plant glycosides that are characterized by their tendency to dramatically foam up when agitated with water. While dozens of saponins are present in hundreds of useful plants, two root-borne saponins stand out among others as yucca’s primary active con- stituents: sarsasapogenin and smila- genin. These two compounds are irritat- ing, cleansing, and penetrating to the mucous membranes of the small intes- tine. It is theorized that these actions aid in the assimilation of important minerals and vitamins by allowing increased pas- sage of critical nutrients through the intestinal walls. This in turn optimizes the nutritional value of an animal’s food. Although many of the specifics of yucca’s medicinal actions remain unclear to scientists, the results of feeding yucca can be astounding. In studies conducted at Colorado State University, cattle who received a small quantity of yucca in their feed showed greater weight gain than those who didn’t. Other trial accounts have concluded that chickens who are fed yucca have a tendency to lay more eggs, and dairy cattle tend to pro- duce more milk. Another reason you may find yucca in dog, cat, horse, or cattle feed is because it has been found to reduce the emission of unpleasant odors in urine and feces. In studies that examined the chemical breakdown of urea (the body’s final by- product of digested proteins), it was found that the anhydrous ammonia that is largely responsible for the less-than- delightful odor of animal excrement is caused by a single microbial enzyme called urease. Further studies concluded that food supplements of Y. schidigera inhibit the production of urease, and as a result, fecal and urine odors are reduced by up to 56 percent in dogs and 49 per- cent in cats. Believe it or not, this attrib- ute has brought about tremendous mar- ket appeal for yucca, as millions of peo- ple find the notion of less offensive ani- mal waste an attractive alternative to promptly cleaning it up. The holistic question is, What are the deeper purpos- es of the urease enzymes we wish to sup- press? Urease is a natural by-product of a natural metabolic process, and we can only speculate about the long-term results of our interference. People who accept this concept without question simply don’t realize (or don’t care) that poor-quality proteins produce excess urea and larger, more offensive stools. If an animal is fed a balanced natural diet, excess fecal and urine odor shouldn’t occur. Although much of yucca’s nutritive value is likely attributable to its actions upon the intestinal membranes, the mystique surrounding this plant’s impressive track record as a medicine Y Yucca schidigera becomes much clearer when we take a close look at its active ingredients. Sarsasapogenin and smilagenin are known by the scientific and herbal com- munity as phytosterols, or more specifi- cally steroidal saponins, which are com- pounds that act as precursors to the cor- ticosteroids naturally produced in the body. Both of these compounds are extracted from yucca and various other herbs as starter substances in the pro- duction of pharmaceutical corticosteroid drugs. If this sounds ominous to those of you who are seeking natural alternatives to such drugs, please rest assured. The differences between a phytos- terol and a synthetic steroid drug are extreme. The process by which phytos- terols are used to manufacture pharma- ceutical steroids starts with a simple plant compound and proceeds from there into a complex scientific process that would have given Einstein a headache. Comparing yucca to a corti- costeroid drug is like comparing a single chemical compound in a packet of active dry yeast with a loaf of finished twelve- grain bread. The terms plant steroids and plant hormones are erroneous—no known plant actually carries steroidal hormones into the body. In essence, phytosterols stimulate and assist the body in using and producing its own corticosteroids and corticosteroid-related hormones. Furthermore, steroidal sa- ponins work with the natural immune functions of the body, whereas syntheti- cally produced counterparts such as the prescription drug prednisolone are designed and introduced into the body with the intent of suppressing immune functions to attain the desired results. Although this theory has not been proven as fact by the scientific communi- ty, it can be reasonably hypothesized that the natural corticosteroid-like actions of yucca may play a role in the body’s natural production of growth hormones. This in turn may contribute significantly to the accelerated growth and production we see in animals who receive this plant in their food. We do know, however, that yucca is safe when fed in moderation. A water extract (tea) of Y. glauca (small soapweed) has been shown to have antitumor activity against certain melanomas in mice. Its mechanism in this context is believed to stem from polysaccharide constituents, not neces- sarily steroidal saponins. In a study conducted at the begin- ning of the twentieth century, the “saponin extract” from the “desert yucca plant” was found to bring about safe and effective relief from pain and inflamma- tion in human arthritis patients who were given the extract four times daily over an extended period. Although this study has been repeatedly discredited by the American Arthritis Foundation because of the controversial manner in which it was conducted, the beneficial effects of yucca in humans and animals remain clearly validated in the minds of holistic practitioners who have used it repeatedly and have witnessed positive results. Several contemporary natur- opaths, veterinarians, and animal nutri- tionists who use yucca in their practices claim that yucca has a 50 to 80 percent success rate in bringing relief to patients suffering from either osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. Again, yucca’s effectiveness here is likely attributable to the plant’s nutrition-assisting and anti- inflammatory actions of its steroidal saponin constituents. To stimulate appetite and increase absorption of nutrients or to relieve the pain and inflammation of arthritis, add a 1⁄2 teaspoon of the dried and powdered root to each pound of a dog’s daily food ration. Cats need only 1⁄4 teaspoon daily. Herbs for Pets 200 y Materia Medica 201 If you opt to use a tincture, find or make one that contains less than 5 percent alcohol because high-alcohol prepara- tions of this herb may nauseate animals. A good tincture dose is about 1⁄8 tea- spoon (0.5 milliliter) for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, once daily before a meal. Half a cup of the dried, chopped root is a sufficient daily dose for horses and other large animals. Availability: Herb retailers and land- scape nurseries Propagation and Harvest: Because of their moderate size, attractive flowers and foliage, and low water and mainte- nance requirements, Y. schidigera and Y. glauca have become popular as land- scape plants in areas with moderate tem- peratures and low to moderate precipita- tion. These plants do well in depleted soils, and once established they require little care. Alternatives and Adjuncts: For arthritis, yucca combines well with al- falfa, licorice, dandelion, or shepherd’s purse. Cautions and Comments: If used in large dosages or over an extended period of time, yucca may become irritating to the stomach lining and intestinal mucosa, which may cause vomiting. This problem can be especially dangerous in horses and other large animals who are unable to vomit (instead they bloat). Many Indian tribes of the American Southwest used yucca preparations to induce vomiting in cases of food poisoning. For this reason we would not use any food additive that contains in excess of 15 percent yucca root unless instructed to do so by a veteri- narian or trained animal nutritionist. We do not recommend feeding yucca every day in an animal’s diet either; rather, give the animal at least a two-day break from the herb each week. Many holistic prac- titioners believe that if the plant is used constantly over an extended period of time, the saponins in yucca actually begin to have a reverse effect, slowing nutrient absorption (especially fat-solu- ble vitamins such as vitamin D) in the small intestine. Allowing breaks in your animal’s diet helps to alleviate the possi- bility of a cumulative irritating effect in her digestive tract. y Ashwaganda Withania somnifera Primary Medicinal Activities: Strengthens the body’s resistance to stress (adaptogenic), anti-inflammatory, antitumor, lowers blood pressure Common Uses: Coughs, debility, nausea, fever, tumors, wounds, senility Safety/Cautions/Contraindications: None found Bilberry Vaccinium myrtillus Primary Medicinal Activities: Antispasmodic Common Uses: Eye problems (given inter- nally) Safety/Cautions/Contraindications: None found Blue Cohosh Caulophyllum thalictroides Primary Medicinal Activities: Uterine tonic, antispasmodic, promotes menstrual discharge, antirheumatic Common Uses: Can be used during preg- nancy in humans anytime there is threat of miscarriage.

Herbs for Pets 210 Materia Medica 211 Supplemental Herb List AILMENTS AND TREATMENTS I n this chapter we discuss some of the more common ailments an animal guardian may encounter in the holistic care of animals. Each ailment is categorized by the body system in which it predominates—for example, kennel cough is discussed in the “Respiratory Problems” section, and the issue of fleas is discussed under “Parasite-Related Problems,” and so forth. For each ailment discussed, we include a variety of herbal treatments and other holistic measures that you may find helpful in reaching a remedial or curative solution for your companion. To learn more about the herb choices we present in this chapter, and to deter- mine whether one or more of these choices may be appropriate for your compan- ion, we recommend that you refer to chapter 3. There you will find detailed infor- mation such as dosages and parts of the herbs used, preparation and administra- tion options, contraindications, and possible side effects of most of the herbs in the repertory. By no means, though, is this repertory a complete representation of all measures of herbal healing. There are hundreds of potentially useful herbs not dis- cussed here, and we urge you to also access the excellent texts included in the bib- liography. This repertory is also not intended to serve as a substitute for the advice and care of a licensed veterinarian. Its purpose only is to express our experiences and opinions. Please keep in mind that we are herbalists, not licensed animal care providers. Anxiety, Nervousness, and Behavioral Problems HOLISTIC APPROACHES It is part of human nature to impose our ideals of acceptable behavior upon our beloved animals. Unfortunately, though, many of us find it difficult to separate An Herbal Repertory for Animals An Herbal Repertory for Animals Chapter 3 Herbs for Pets 214 these ideals from what makes each ani- mal special, unique, and happy. Thousands of animals are euthanized each year because they were “untrain- able” or “uncontrollable,” “barked too much,” or were simply “too much to bear.” Many of these animals were put to death not because there was something untreatably wrong with them but because their identities clashed with their caregivers’. One of the greatest gifts offered to us by animals comes when we learn to look beyond our own needs to their happi- ness. Our eight-year-old shepherd/husky dog, Willow, still barks incessantly, whines obnoxiously on trips to the river, and jumps up onto house guests despite our continuing efforts to direct her toward our needs. Sometimes we want to pull out our own hair and tie her snout shut with it, but instead we have devel- oped patience and respect for her per- sonal nature. Willow is simply doing what she must do to be complete and happy, and while we are still working on the guest-mauling issue, we have learned to accept her just the way she is. By reach- ing this level of acceptance, we have been rewarded with the joy she brings to us as we rejoice with her in her rapturous journey through life. Granted, there is a social stigma attached to certain types of animal behavior. However, before we step in and choose what is best for us, we owe it to our animal companions to try to look at the world through their eyes— perhaps even before we bring one of them home. Anxiety, nervousness, fear, occasional aggression, and depression are normal emotions of each and every animal’s life. Some animals may be terrified of thunder, cars, vets, and stairs. Others may dislike children or other animals. Active dog breeds (such as border collies) usually need wide-open spaces to run, and they become anxious if confined. Many cats who would rather sleep than play become nervous wrecks during car rides. But if your animal’s behavior changes suddenly or if his nervous tendencies worsen over time, your animal may be ill. Contrary to conventional standards, holistic treatment of anxiety, nervousness, or behavioral problems does not begin with the use of sedative or antidepressive medicines but with a critical examination of the caregiver’s perspective of a situa- tion. Are we really treating anxiety or aggression, or is the problem a symptom of something deeper within the animal or his environment? Perhaps the problem is not really the animal’s at all but instead emanates from the caregiver’s unfulfilled expectations. CHRONIC PROBLEMS Emotional, behavioral, and nervous dis- orders can result from nutritional defi- ciencies, endocrine disease, vaccinosis, drug side effects, parasites, neurological disease, or psychological problems. Like humans, animals can suffer from chronic depression that is secondary to chemical imbalances in the brain. But before treat- We owe it to our animal companions to look at the world through their eyes. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 215 ing depression with Prozac (fluoxetine HCl) or Saint-John’s-wort, you should make a thorough assessment of the ani- mal’s diet, health care history, and envi- ronment. In most cases, the caregiver is likely to find that the problem is cor- rectable with dietary changes, some lov- ing attention, and perhaps the correct homeopathic remedy. Our approach toward aggression, depression (which is manifested by a lack of energy, whining, separation anxiety, to name a few symptoms), nervousness, chronic anxiety, or hyperactivity always begins with changing the animal’s diet (usually to raw food) and supplementing it with a complement of vitamins, miner- als, and EFAs. If this does not effect a pos- itive change, the animal should be checked by a veterinarian for underlying physiological disorders such as thyroid or adrenal gland problems, malabsorption, tumors, parasites, or diabetes mellitus. Once the underlying causes are identi- fied, they can be treated with applicable herbs, homeopathic remedies, aroma- therapy, flower essences, or nutritional therapies. Behavioral training, therapeu- tic touch, or a few sessions with a rep- utable animal communicator may also yield good results. In all chronic cases, the sedative herbs (e.g., valerian, skullcap, passionflower) should be limited to temporary control of symptoms during times of added stress such as dreaded car rides to the veterinarian. We do not condone the use of sedative herbs on a daily lifelong basis—not only because of potential side effects but also because they may mask symptoms that are important to recog- nize in reaching curative solutions. Similarly, Saint-John’s-wort and other antidepressants should be reserved for cases in which chronic depression is known to be secondary to brain chemi- cal imbalances. Adaptogenic herbs such as Siberian ginseng, astragalus, and certified-organic ginseng, may be used continually in moderation to boost the body’s function- al abilities under stress. AGGRESSION AND DEPRESSION DISORDERS As of 1999, the use of Prozac had become almost as fashionable for treat- ing aggressive animals as it had for humans with chronic depression disor- ders. Likewise, Saint-John’s-wort had been touted as “the herbal alternative to Prozac,” and it too had become popular for treating aggression and other behav- ioral and emotional disorders in animals. Although Saint-John’s-wort and psy- chotropic drugs may have a place in the treatment of certain disorders, they are not the panaceas that some companies would like us to believe they are. Many experts believe that these substances may actually cause a reverse effect in some animals. In Peter Neville’s ac- claimed book Do Dogs Need Shrinks? he cites case histories in which Prozac not only failed to curb aggression but seem- ingly increased it. One case involved a Determine the cause of any emotional or behavioral disorder before treating it. Herbs for Pets 216 two-year-old Staffordshire bull terrier who was given the drug to stop him from assaulting other dogs. Initially the attacks stopped, but later the dog resumed his hostile behavior—and when he was taken off Prozac, he became more aggressive than ever. Another case involved a three-year-old pointer who was given Prozac to stop her from con- stantly chasing shadows. After three days she began attacking real dogs instead. Compounding the potential prob- lems of reverse or other adverse side effects is our limited ability to identify accurately the causes of aggression and depression disorders in animals. The diagnosis needed to prudently prescribe such drugs is severely limited by lack of verbal communication between animal and healer. In other words, psychotropic drugs (and even the safer Saint-John’s- wort) are usually prescribed as a specula- tive “shot in the dark” approach to sup- pression of symptoms, rather than as part of a curative solution that is based on holism. From a holistic perspective, treatment of aggression begins in the mind of the human guardian—not the animal. The question of what may be missing from the animal’s well-being must be answered before anything else. Is the animal receiving all of the nutrients needed for proper brain function? Was the animal abused or neglected in the past? Is there a genetic predisposition to be addressed? Is there anything in the animal’s living environment that might be contributing to the problem? Has the animal had adequate opportunities to socialize with other animals and people? Is the animal’s behavior related to your own? (This is fairly common—animals often pick up the emotional tone of their living environment.) After the animal’s diet is changed and supplemented, sessions with a good ani- mal behaviorist are highly recommend- ed. Animal behaviorists do not teach “sit-stay” obedience but use their expert knowledge of animal behavior and human-animal relationships to help identify and provide fulfillment of psy- chological requirements. For instance, most dogs who are “fear biters” do not exhibit aggressive behavior out of hate or neurological disease but because they are insecure in the hierarchy of their “pack.” These dogs feel that their human alpha leader is not in charge of their sur- roundings and therefore feel constantly threatened. The animal behaviorists’ job in this situation is to help the guardian and the animal define their positions as leader-protector (the human) and safe- subordinate pack member (the dog). Horses and other herbivores, of course, have completely different psycholo- gies—but they too can find a happier coexistence with their humans with some help from a professional behavior trainer. Once you have begun a curative, long-term approach toward your ani- mal’s aggression or depression, herbs can be used for symptomatic relief dur- Chamomile can help lift your pet’s mood naturally. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 217 ing occasions when stress levels are par- ticularly high. Although many herbalists recommend valerian as a first choice herb for anxiety and aggression, it can have a reverse, sometimes stimulating, effect in some animals. It’s a depressant and tends to compound irritability and depression. Instead of lifting the subject’s spirit, it slows him down and often turns him into a groggy grump. So rather than reaching for valerian, we opt for herbs such as pas- sionflower, lemon balm, chamomile, or catnip that serve more as mood eleva- tors. Rescue Remedy (a flower essence formula) is also one of our first choices. ACUTE NERVOUSNESS AND ANXIETY Everyone has his or her own sources of psychological stress. Some people get nervous and tense during airplane land- ings. Our dogs get anxious and fright- ened while inside crowded buildings. Stephanie the cat trembles during the first half-hour of long car rides. Herbs can be helpful for gently calm- ing an animal during stressful occasions. In circumstances in which fear and anxi- ety prohibit an otherwise passive animal from relaxing, valerian may induce just enough sedation to allow napping. If the animal’s anxiety is causing him to hiss, spit, bite, or make other demonstrations of potential violence, a dose or two of passionflower, lemon balm, or catnip may help normalize attitude and defuse the situation. If nervousness is causing trembling or hypersensitivity to touch and sound, skullcap or oatstraw can be very effective—especially if combined with valerian or passionflower. A small dose (0.25 milliliters per 30 pounds of an animal’s body weight) of vervain (Verbena officinalis) tincture may reduce muscle twitching and restlessness, but too much of this herb may have a reverse effect. In situations in which nervousness is causing an upset stomach, chamomile, valerian, catnip, or a combination of all three may help induce relaxation and prevent vomiting. Before you reach for valerian or any other herb, try giving your pet a few drops of Rescue Remedy (flower essence formula), which you can purchase at health food stores. You and your com- panion may be pleasantly surprised. Arthritis and Hip Dysplasia The term arthritis is general, referring to the inflammation of a joint. Polyarthritis is the inflammation of several joints. Degenerative arthritis is a term that refers to the condition caused by the wearing of joints as the animal ages. It is also known as degenerative joint disease and is sometimes caused by trauma to the joints, bones, ligaments, or cartilage. Osteoarthritis is usually the result of some type of secondary damage to the joint structures. The damage could result from rupture of ligaments, poor anatomical alignment, or joint dislocation. Inflammatory arthritis can be caused by an infection or an immune-mediated Catnip can help calm an animal who is suffering from anxiety. Herbs for Pets 218 disease that leads to destructive arthritic lesions. In other words, its onset is caused when the immune system actually turns against the body it’s supposed to protect. Arthritis may also take the form of hip dysplasia. Hip dysplasia is the abnormal development of the “ball and socket” joint of the hips of dogs. This condition may vary from a slightly abnormal hip joint to the actual dislocation of the joint. There is controversy among holis- tic and homeopathic veterinarians regarding the underlying cause of hip dysplasia. Some holistic veterinarians believe that this condition might be caused by vaccinations, specifically the rabies vaccine. Others say it is caused by heredity—but if this is so, and conscien- tious breeders are taking care not to breed animals who show signs of it, then why is it not being eliminated? Why is it appearing in an increasing number of breeds more frequently? Despite the evi- dence, many veterinarians maintain that hip dysplasia is a genetic predisposition in many breeds of dogs. To an extent this may be true, but we believe that there are too many coincidences between hip dysplasia and overvaccina- tion. If your dog is young and may be prone to hip dysplasia, you might want to consider not vaccinating every year. The belief that hip dysplasia is strictly a hereditary disease discourages many people from growing attached to dogs who are believed to be predisposed. This is truly a shame. Not only can a predis- posed breed of dog lead a normal, healthy life but there is a good possibility that hip dysplasia can be prevented by taking some simple, lifelong measures. In the book Alternative and Comple- mentary Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practice, Wendell O. Belfield, D.V.M., states that hip dysplasia may be caused more by biochemical factors than by genetic inheritance. He believes that hip dysplasia may be an easily controlled bio- chemical condition in most breeds of dogs caused by insufficient collagen syn- thesis. He says that if insufficient amounts of Vitamin C exist in affected dogs, they may have difficulty synthesizing enough collagen to assist in maintaining joint sta- bility. Dr. Belfield substantiates his state- ment with a study he conducted involv- ing eight litters of German shepherd puppies who came from bloodlines that were believed to be afflicted with heredi- tary hip dysplasia. During their pregnan- cy, bitches were administered megadoses of vitamin C, and the puppies were main- tained on a similar regimen until adult- hood. As a result, no signs of canine hip Comfrey can help repair aching bones and joints. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 219 dysplasia were noted in any of the offspring. Unless onset is acute, such as after a joint injury, the first sign of arthritis is usually lameness that may be worsened by cold, inclement weather or exercise. You might first notice that your animal isn’t getting around as easily as he once did. You might observe your companion having difficulty getting on or off the couch, climbing the stairs, or perhaps jumping in and out of the car. If you are keenly perceptive of subtle changes in your companion, early onset of arthritis might be signified by abnormal behavior that points to physical discomfort—per- haps your friend just isn’t his “old self” or appears irritable for no apparent reason. Watch the daily appearance and behavior of your companion closely. Keep a health care diary for your animal, bearing in mind that nothing you observe is insignificant. If you do keep a diary, you will be much more effective in prevent- ing simple morning stiffness from becoming a crippling disease. As an animal ages, his joints don’t move quite as easily as they once did (Don’t we all know that feeling when getting in and out of our favorite easy chair?), but if joint stiffness appears to be progressing ahead of your companion’s age, it’s time to take remedial measures. But before you start administering herbal remedies, you should know the exact nature of your companion’s arthritis. This may require the opinion of a holistic vet- erinarian who can diagnose the many dif- ferent kinds of arthritis. HOLISTIC APPROACHES If your animal has arthritis, his immune system needs either to be boosted or brought back into balance with the rest of his body. But if the arthritis is related to immune system dysfunction, you may find that immunostimulant herbs such as echinacea aggravate your companion’s condition. Remember that the inflamma- tion associated with rheumatoid arthritis is likely caused by an autoimmune attack upon the joints. If we stimulate the immune system into working harder, we might actually make the arthritis worse. Instead, holistic efforts should be directed at what is causing the dysfunc- tion. This starts with a critical assessment of the animal’s diet, an evaluation of pos- sible food allergies, and a thorough investigation of present and historical influences that may be affecting your companion’s immune system. Such influ- ences may include vaccinations, antibiot- ic or steroid drug therapies, or toxic ele- ments in your animal’s environment. Any associated disorders should be identified and corrected as well. For example, does your arthritic companion suffer from chronic constipation, weight problems, hair loss, diarrhea, bladder or kidney problems, chronic infections, or a skin condition? If so, such conditions are likely related to the arthritis. When you have identified as many of these factors as possible, it’s time to take remedial action by piecing this holistic puzzle together. It’s important to remember that because arthritis is such a complex and variable disease, there is no singular herbal approach to treating it. Instead, holistic treatment is multifaceted, including nutritional supplementation and herbs that are tailored to an ani- mal’s individual needs. If the arthritis is due to wear-and-tear joint deterioration (a frequent problem with working or hard-playing animals), then the supplements glucosamine sulfate and chondroitin sulfate might assist the body in repairing itself. Glucosamine and its related products, glucosamine sulfate and n-acetylglucosamine, have found a use as nutritional anti-osteoarthritic agents by helping protect and regener- Herbs for Pets 220 ate connective tissue and cartilage in affected joints. N-acetylglucosamine has shown promise in the treatment of inflammatory disorders, including inflam- matory bowel disease, Crohn’s disease, and colitis. Bovine or shark cartilage, vitamin C, and EFA supplements help repair joint tis- sue damage. Horsetail herb might be of help too, as it contains a bioavailable form of silicon, an element that serves as the active matrix in connective tissue development. Comfrey is also considered a classic bone and joint repair herb. In addition to their internal uses, these herbs can be effective when applied in the form of an external compress, especially when combined with cayenne and willow bark, which should not be used in cats. Mineral- and vitamin-rich herbs such as nettle and dandelion provide nutrients that are needed for joint repair along with diuretic activities to help remove excess metabolic wastes from the body, via the urinary tract, that may otherwise contribute to solid buildups in the joints. These herbs also help strengthen kidney function during the ordeal. Another herb to consider is shepherd’s purse—this diuretic is believed to have a special affin- ity toward removal of waste compounds from arthritic joints. Celery seed and parsley root are also excellent choices. Alterative herbs such as alfalfa, red clover, and burdock are strongly indicat- ed to build up blood structure and to assist with the transport of systemic waste from body tissues. Liver supporting herbs (hepatics) such as dandelion root, yellow dock, and Oregon grape help by strengthening liver and gallbladder func- tion, thus helping with digestion, nutri- ent absorption, and solid waste elimina- tion. Lymphatic herbs such as cleavers and calendula may be of assistance by aiding the circulation of tissue-cleansing lymph in and around inflamed areas. Cayenne and ginger also may be use- ful. Both are vasodilators and may bene- fit the arthritic animal by increasing blood circulation to affected areas. In some animals, though, these same actions may aggravate an inflammatory condition. For this reason, internal use of these herbs should proceed with caution, and it is best to administer them in small doses that are proportioned as lesser ingredients to a formula composed of other anti-inflammatory and alterative herbs. Herbs that are useful internally for inflammation and pain of arthritis and hip dysplasia include licorice, yucca, and willow bark (the latter is not for cats). Alfalfa also has a long-standing reputa- tion for relieving the discomforts of arthritis. It should be among one of the first herbs to be considered for internal use because it can be safely fed as a daily food supplement (1 teaspoon per pound of food fed each day). Tonics as well as herbs can be helpful in treating arthritis. Circulatory tonics such as yarrow, hawthorn, rosemary, and ginkgo are worth considering for internal use. They provide a gentle increase of blood flow in tissues surrounding arthrit- ic joints, so muscles remain oxygenated and more flexible. On the facing page is a basic tonic for- mula for arthritic animals. Ingredients can be changed, added to, and propor- tioned to serve the specific needs of your animal. The arthritis relief compress that follows might also help to relieve the pain of arthritis. Animals have a reputation for not let- ting their chronic problems slow them down much. As a result, arthritic joints sometimes become aggravated and inflamed because of physical exertion or injury. Provided that there is no open wound, a simple external application of arnica oil or tincture on the affected An Herbal Repertory for Animals 221 A SYSTEMIC SUPPORT FORMULA FOR CHRONIC ARTHRITIS Combine the following either as dried herbs or tinctures: 2 parts alfalfa 1 part dandelion root 1 part parsley root 1 part cleavers or calendula This formula can be used as a dry herb food supplement. If you do choose to use dry herbs instead of tinctures, use calendula instead of cleavers because cleavers is almost useless after it is dried. An appropriate dose for each 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight is 1 tablespoon mixed into food daily. If you opt to use tinctures, find those that contain little or no alcohol. (They are much easier to feed and much safer on the digestive tract.) You can adminis- ter 2–4 milliliters of the tincture for each 30 pounds of body weight directly into the animal’s mouth or drop it onto his food daily. This combination is safe for dogs, cats, horses, and most other mammals and can be given over an extended period with no ill side effects. If your companion tolerates its bitter flavor, a one-part portion of yarrow can be added to this formula to serve as a vascular tonic. Arthritis Relief Compress* 3 parts dried willow bark 3 parts dried comfrey leaf 3 parts dried yarrow 1 part powdered cayenne *not for use on cats To make this compress, first make a decoction from the willow bark by gently simmering in enough water to cover it for about 20 minutes. Remove from heat but do not drain. While the water is still hot, add the other three ingre- dients. Mix thoroughly, adding just enough boiling water to make a thick paste. Let the mixture stand until it is cool enough to handle but still hot. The poultice is now ready to use as a compress. (See the “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1 for further instructions.) After applying the compress, check it after about 5 minutes to assure that the cayenne is not causing excessive irritation to the animal’s skin. If it is, remove the compress and either lower the proportion of cayenne or remove it from the formula (make a new batch). For best results, the compress should be left on the animal for an hour. Herbs for Pets 222 joints often brings fast symptomatic relief. Some good “strain and sprain” herbal ointments, salves, and liniments are also available on the market, many of which contain time-proven topical anal- gesics such as eucalyptus, cayenne, or camphor. Olbas oil or tiger balm are among our favorites, but do not use these products if your animal is under homeopathic care as they may antidote the homeopathic remedy. Also, be care- ful not to apply any undiluted oil or herbal ointment to an animal, especially cats, who can be sensitive to these types of products. Animals also may lick these products off of their fur and skin, and some of these products may prove toxic if ingested. The discomforts of arthritis can be approached with internal herbal therapies as well, and often the fastest results are reached when topical and internal appli- cations are used simultaneously. See the box on this page for a simple formula for symptomatic relief. Of course, nutrition is the crux of any of the holistic healing modalities and is the most important factor in the preven- tion of arthritis. Many times changing to a raw food diet helps the animal and obviates more drastic measures. Some animals benefit from occasional chiropractic adjustments from a qualified holistic vet who is trained in the proper manipulation of an animal’s spine. Acupuncture may also help many arthrit- ic animals who are in pain. Cancer When we hear the word cancer, many of us immediately think, “Oh no—this is the end!” But cancer is not always a death sen- tence. There are many ways to deal with cancer, and many types of cancer can be treated holistically with the help and advice of a qualified holistic veterinarian. In traditional Western medicine, we have been taught to believe that the best way to treat cancer is to poison it or cut it out. In holistic medicine, the treatment of cancer goes far beyond the physical nature of the disease to address the emo- tional and spiritual aspects of the sufferer as well. Many holistic practitioners believe that by cutting out or poisoning the cancer, we are only driving it else- where—perhaps deeper into the body where it can progress more insidiously. For example, when the “check engine” light goes on in your car, you may stop, check under the hood, and add some oil if needed, or you may park the car and not drive it until the problem is identified. You’re not going to rip out the wire that controls the light so it won’t be a nuisance anymore. Unfortunately, in the case of your car, this quick-fix approach doesn’t address the worn-out crankshaft bearing that degenerates and grinds away the engine block as you continue driving down the road—and when the car breaks down next, the damage is far more likely to be irreparable. Ripping out the wire is A SYMPTOMATIC RELIEF FORMULA Combine the following tinctures: 1 part alfalfa 1 part yucca 1 part licorice for dogs, cats, horses, and most other mammals Feed 1–2 milliliters of this formula for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, one to three times daily for up to ten days or until pain and inflammation are reduced. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 223 exactly what traditional Western medi- cine does in many cases of cancer. Voilà, cut and yank, and the problem has been “remedied.” In holistic medicine, the whole indi- vidual is treated, not just the cancer. Cancer is only a symptom of what is going on deeper within the being. In the treatment or prevention of cancer, all components of body, mind, and spirit need to be evaluated and supported. A critical assessment of diet is the first place to look—feeding poor-quality commer- cial food that is laden with artificial col- ors, preservatives, and by-products only makes the problem worse. The second step is to eliminate unnecessary vaccina- tions from the animal’s life. A body that is working extra hard to build a cancer- fighting immune system doesn’t need the stressful interference of vaccinations. HOLISTIC APPROACHES Nothing would please us more than to inform you of a new herbal “silver bullet” against cancer, but unfortunately such a thing does not exist. Although countless studies support the usefulness of herbs and various other holistic medicines in treating cancer, the disease is far too complex, variable, and adaptable for sin- gular therapeutic approaches. In fact, cancer has so many faces that its early symptoms can include anything from a minor cough or excess shedding to occa- sional diarrhea. Just as varied is the list of possible causes—it seems that everything science looks at closely enough (foods, environmental toxins, natural and syn- thetic chemicals) carries the potential of causing cancer. When cancer has progressed to a point where the diagnosis is certain, cur- ative treatment is often less effective. But, if the disease is caught in its earliest stages, the prognosis can be quite posi- tive. Effective prevention and treatment of cancer must begin with the guardian’s intimate familiarity with his or her ani- mal. Nobody offers more diagnostic insight into cancer than the person who keeps a detailed observational diary of his or her companion animal. The diary should include lifelong records of illnesses or odd behavior or appearances. More important, though, it should reflect what the animal is like dur- ing times of optimal health. The guardian’s capacity to notice minor devi- ations from perfect health is the most powerful tool in the early treatment of cancer and most other types of chronic disease. Following are a few common warning signs the Veterinary Cancer Society rec- ommends that pet owners look for in dogs. These symptoms apply to other animals as well. Remember, nothing here represents a conclusive diagnosis of can- cer, but any symptoms listed should illu- minate a red “check engine” light: • abnormal swellings that continue to grow, especially in the lymph • sores that do not heal • bleeding or discharge from the mouth, nose, urinary tract, vagina, or rectum • offensive odor • difficulty eating or swallowing • difficulty breathing • difficulty urinating or defecating • hesitation to exercise or loss of energy • loss of appetite, weight loss • persistent lameness or stiffness of movement • lumps in the mammary glands • abnormalities or difference in size of testicles All of these symptoms may represent a cancer that has developed beyond its early stages, and therefore the animal should be taken to a holistic veterinarian immediately. Herbs for Pets 224 What might be indicative of the earli- est onset of cancer? Well, just about any- thing out of the ordinary: a chronic cough or skin problem, decreased ener- gy, aggression, pain, or stiffness—the list of early symptoms is endless. This doesn’t mean you should live in constant fear of your companion developing cancer, but you should remain aware that a change that appears to be minor can develop into a serious condition. Don’t ignore any changes in your animal. If a minor prob- lem persists, consult a veterinarian. All forms of cancer share a common characteristic: the disease starts when atypical cells begin reproducing and invading other cells. As healthy cells are destroyed and replaced by cancerous ones, lesions and tumors form and the body structures they occupy become dysfunctional. Many holistic healers theorize that cancer is not really an acquired disease but rather the result of a metabolic imbalance that has progressed out of control. Cancerous tumors begin as small pinpoint lesions that occur off and on throughout an animal’s lifetime. In most cases, the immune system is able to stop the tumors before they develop their own blood supply and begin consuming cell structures elsewhere in the body. But if the body is not in homeostasis (a state of balanced, harmonious health), it may not be able to eliminate the tumor before it takes control of its surroundings and a malignancy results. From this holistic per- spective, carcinogenic compounds, excess ultraviolet light and radiation, and other substances that are said to cause cancer are not seen as “carriers” of the disease but as triggering or encouraging mechanisms. The potential for cancer exists within every animal (human and otherwise). The key to preventing it lies inside a healthy body, not only in the outside influences that we consider threats. Perhaps you have noticed (as we have) that a disproportionate number of seem- ingly healthy people develop cancer despite all external efforts to avoid it. Why is this? It is because despite all the measures they may have taken toward eliminating potential carcinogens from their lives, deeper issues of physical, emo- tional, and spiritual health have not been addressed, and the people have fallen from homeostasis. None of this is to say that we should disregard the existence of carcinogenic substances in food, water, and the envi- ronment. To the contrary, every effort should be made to become aware of and eliminate cancer-causing factors in our lives and the lives of our animals. But we must also provide our bodies with the proper elements of nutrition and sys- temic support that are needed to main- tain homeostasis and prevent cancer. Furthermore, the immune system must be properly equipped and always ready to respond to a nearly infinite number of cancer-causing influences. It must be allowed to do its job without interference from antibiotics, immune-suppressing corticosteroid drugs, and vaccine thera- pies. Every time we interfere with natural immune system functions we may be compromising the body’s ability to respond to and correct cellular or immune system imbalances that could develop into cancer. WHEN CANCER OCCURS The immune system represents the most complete form of disease intervention on earth. If allowed or enabled to function, it is infinitely more efficient than any- thing human beings can comprehend, much less devise. When cancer takes hold, the body’s defenses need all of their resources to fight it. The holistic approach to cancer begins, then, by pro- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 225 viding the body with every opportunity to perform optimally. This means supply- ing it with supplemental measures of nutritional and systemic support. Several diet programs have been designed to strengthen and support ani- mals with cancer. Many involve foods that are rich in fiber and antioxidant compounds. Intensive vitamin, mineral, and other supplemental therapies are often employed as well. These typically include vitamins A, B complex, C, and E, as well as selenium, iron, coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), EFAs, digestive enzymes, and dimethylglycine. The best anticancer diet for your animal is one tailored specifical- ly to his individual needs by a holistic vet- erinarian who is familiar with treating the disease. HERBAL THERAPIES Herbs play important roles in supporting the body in its effort to rid itself of can- cer. Herbal therapies focus on tonic sup- port of organs and systems that have special significance in the fight. Because cancer is so variable, it’s difficult to gen- eralize an herbal approach. Every case of cancer is different, as are the metabolic requirements of each animal who has cancer. But a good starting point for herbal treatment of all animals with can- cer is to support the liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system—the body’s waste fil- tering and elimination systems. By help- ing the body cleanse itself, the immune system is less encumbered with cleanup chores and better able to fight cancer. The infamous Essiac and Hoxsey formulas were designed for this purpose. Although the formulas for both have likely been changed several times over the past years, each contains an array of alterative and cholagogue herbs that are targeted toward cleaning the blood, improving digestion, and eliminating waste (prima- rily via the digestive tract). The Essiac for- mula is commonly marketed in health food stores. The Hoxsey formula is available in var- ious interpretations most of which con- tain at least six different herbs. Some herbalists, however, believe that the orig- inal formula contained only two: red clover and burdock. Red clover is at the top of our list of anticancer herbs because it inhibits the activities of carcinogenic compounds, helps improve blood structure, and strengthens lymphatic functions that are crucial in cleansing cell tissues through- out the body. It also contains sterol con- stituents that may inhibit the production of blood vessels that supply and support newly formed tumors. Alfalfa provides similar alterative activities, but we don’t know yet if it possesses the same tumor- inhibiting properties as red clover. Burdock and dandelion root provide gentle stimulation to the liver, thus improving digestion and the removal of waste. These herbs do not cause added strain upon the filtering organs, and therefore they can be used continuously over a long period. In situations in which toxic buildup of systemic waste must be Red clover has many anticancer and tumor-inhibiting properties. Herbs for Pets 226 eliminated quickly in order to liberate the immune system, yellow dock serves as a much stronger liver stimulant and in fact is known as a traditional remedy for heavy metal toxicity (it is also a laxative). Milk thistle may be helpful for protecting the liver against harmful by-products of the cancer or from damage that may result after protracted drug therapies. Diuretic herbs may also aid in removal of systemic waste via the kidneys and uri- nary tract. At the top of the diuretic list are dandelion leaf and nettle. These herbs stimulate urine production and provide potassium and other minerals that need to be continually replaced throughout the cleansing process. To help remove toxic waste, slippery elm, marshmallow, flaxseed, and plantain serve as useful devices for lubricating, pro- tecting, and reducing inflammation of mucous membranes throughout the uri- nary and digestive tracts. If poor liver func- tion has caused chronic constipation, fre- quent small doses of turkey rhubarb tinc- ture (0.25 milliliters per 30 pounds of the animal’s body weight, three times daily) serve as an effective laxative. It should be limited to as-needed, short-term use because it can cause diarrhea, intestinal cramping, and other discomforts. Immunostimulant herbs may help boost your companion’s immune response to the cancer. Astragalus is especially well suited for this purpose because it adds energy-boosting adapto- genic qualities to its immunostimulant properties in cancer-debilitated animals. Garlic is another excellent immune sys- tem tonic to consider. While boosting production of killer T cells and other immune system components, it has also been shown to trigger enzyme responses that help break down waste materials before they enter the bloodstream. Once the specific characteristics of the cancer have been identified and correlat- ed with the animal’s holistic needs and cancer-fighting abilities, herbal medi- cines may be administered directly against the cancer. As we mentioned ear- lier, this approach requires the experi- ence of a trained professional who is used to recognizing and treating cancer. Many herbal devices have shown great promise in combating specific forms of cancer. Acemannan, a compound derived from aloe vera, has been shown to be effective A TONIC SUPPORT FORMULA FOR ANIMALS WITH CANCER Combine the following low-alcohol (glycerin) herb tinctures: 2 parts red clover 1 part astragalus 1 part dandelion root 1 part garlic This formula can be fed to the ani- mal continuously over a long peri- od: 0.5 milliliters per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, three times daily. If constipation is part of your animal’s problem, try adding 2 parts marshmallow to the formula. If this fails to bring results, add 1 part yellow dock. If that doesn’t work, try substituting the yellow dock with turkey rhubarb. If liver damage is evident or a threat, twice-daily doses of milk thistle may be fed in addition to this formula to help repair and protect the liver. A stan- dardized milk thistle preparation that contains at least 70 percent sily- marin constituents is best for repair- ing an already damaged liver. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 227 against fibrosarcoma and FeLV. It is theo- rized that acemannan triggers an increase in the immune attack upon the viruses believed to cause these usually fatal dis- eases. An intravenous drug called Carnivora is derived from the Venus’s fly- trap plant for treatment of malignant tumors. Although it has not been approved for use in North America as of 1999, Carnivora has shown some incredi- ble tumor-reducing results in Europe. Herbalists have also seen good results from the use of violet leaf extract in the treatment of certain cancers. It, too, is believed to have tumor-reducing qualities. Cardiovascular Problems In contrast with the vast array of cardio- vascular disorders that loom over their human guardians, animals have little risk of contracting heart or arterial dis- ease during the first three-quarters of their lives. Strokes and heart attacks are almost unheard of in dogs and cats sim- ply because their bodies are naturally designed to metabolize the meat and animal fats that send many of their caretakers to an early grave. This does- n’t mean that animals aren’t susceptible to the ills of chemical preservatives, excess sodium, and refined sugar. Nor does it mean their cardiovascular sys- tems are more resilient to abuse or neg- lect. It means only that unhealthy foods, chemicals, and environmental influences may have a different effect on our companion animals than they do on us. Simply put, a dog or cat on a low-quality, poorly digestible commer- cial diet is far more likely to die from kidney failure than arteriosclerosis. On the same note, an animal’s cardiovascu- lar system will fail, just as ours will, unless all requirements of good nutri- tion, exercise, and environmental quali- ty are met. The heart and vascular system oper- ates continuously and under constant pressure throughout an animal’s life. Factors such as excessive body fat, chronic illness, secondhand smoke, and aging add to the stress and inevitable wear and tear of this vital system. Unlike us, however, our companions have little choice in how their cardiovascular health is maintained—that determina- tion is left up to us. DIET AND EXERCISE: THE HEART OF HEART HEALTH Cardiovascular health all begins with a complete diet. The heart consists of spe- cially adapted smooth muscles and con- nective tissues that must perform opti- mally throughout every moment during an animal’s life; therefore, the heart needs to be continually fed and repaired. The vascular system must remain strong, free of obstructions, and responsive to the body’s needs. It, too, must be contin- ually supplied with the tools and fuel needed for self-maintenance and flawless function. A big problem arises, however, when an animal is afforded only an aver- age “maintenance diet” for subsistence. The cardiovascular system’s nutritional Ginkgo helps to increase circulation. Herbs for Pets 228 daily requirements are never static but instead are continually fluctuating and changing as challenges arise. This means that no single commercial diet, no matter how complete, organic, or digestible it might be, can contain all of the nutrition- al elements your companion’s heart needs on a day-to-day basis. The only way to be sure that your ani- mal is receiving the nutrition needed for good cardiovascular health is to provide a diversity of fresh whole foods through- out his life. Supplemental vitamins, min- erals, and EFAs also help assure that your companion’s cardiovascular system is getting the special considerations it needs. Amino acids are especially impor- tant, as they serve as the protein building blocks of smooth-muscle development and repair. Cats must have taurine in their diets, and dogs must have a suffi- cient supply of l-carnitine, or degenera- tive heart disease (idiopathic dilated car- diomyopathy) may result. Coenzyme Q10 also plays important roles in prevention and treatment of heart problems. It has been shown to help protect the heart muscle from damage secondary to hypoxia, infection, and inflammation. CARDIOVASCULAR PROBLEMS IN DOGS AND CATS In cats, the most common form of nonin- herited (acquired) heart disease is hyper- trophic cardiomyopathy, an enlargement of the left ventricular wall and septum that reduces the heart’s functional ability to pump blood. In dogs, the most com- mon form of acquired heart disease is valvular degeneration in which the heart valves fail to completely close when they should, causing an audible (with a stethoscope) heart murmur and decreased cardiac output. This condition can lead to poor circulation to the extremities, the formation of blood clots in the veins and arteries, and congestive heart failure. In both dogs and cats, acquired cardiomyopathy is most likely to occur in middle-aged or older animals. Animals may suffer from inherited forms of heart disease as well. In dogs, one of the most common is patent duc- tus arteriosus, a congenital defect (most commonly seen in miniature poodles and German shepherds) that essentially amounts to a leak between chambers of the heart. In cats, congenital defects in the mitral and tricuspid valves of the heart are fairly common. Other forms of cardiovascular disease may be secondary to bacterial, proto- zoan, or viral infection. Congestive heart failure, a condition in which high pres- sure in the left atrium of the heart causes a backup of fluid into the pulmonary cap- illaries and lungs, is common in obese or geriatric animals or those with heart defects or dysfunction. Animals with heart problems may exhibit shortness of breath, coughing, and diminished physical stamina. Further examination may reveal cardiac arrhyth- mia, pulmonary edema, or blood pres- sure problems. If you suspect that your animal companion has a heart problem, you should get him to a holistic veterinar- ian right away. HERBAL THERAPIES The herbal approach to heart disorders is to strengthen and support cardiovascular and pulmonary function and efficiency. Tonic herbal therapies are especially help- ful in older animals who need a gentle measure of daily cardiovascular support. In all cases, a daily supplement of hawthorn helps improve coronary blood flow, moderate blood pressure, and strengthen heartbeat. Garlic may also be of benefit. Ginkgo, yarrow, or cayenne should also be considered to help increase circulation in the extremities, brain, and throughout the peripheral An Herbal Repertory for Animals 229 capillaries of the body. If rapid, erratic heartbeat is part of your companion’s dis- order, bugleweed may be useful to safely slow and strengthen the heart. If myocar- dial inflammation or pulmonary edema is present (such as with congestive heart failure), a daily regimen of strong dande- lion leaf tea helps remove excess fluid from the body. At the same time, it sup- plies the body with potassium, a mineral that is essential to healthy heart function. Adaptogenic herbs such as astragalus or Siberian ginseng may increase overall energy levels in the animal. Astragalus is also known to have antiviral qualities that are specific to heart infections. Echinacea or other immunostimulant herbs are indi- cated in circumstances where bacterial or viral infection is involved. Digestive System Problems We are all familiar with the sounds and sights of an animal suffering from diges- tive upset—and with cleaning up the aftermath. This is not a pleasant part of taking care of animals, but it’s a fact of life, nonetheless. It’s normal for a healthy animal to vomit or get diarrhea on occasion. Dogs and cats may intuitively induce vomiting by eating grass or other plants. This action serves to cleanse the stomach. Diarrhea may occur if your animal eats something that he is not accustomed to or eats too much of something that his body doesn’t need, such as salty food that was sneaked beneath the dinner table. Vomiting and diarrhea are usually harmless and self-correcting, but they could also be symptoms of a much more serious condition. Digestive upset could be indicative of a parasite imbalance, pancreatitis, colitis, giardiasis, ulcers, liver dysfunction, bacte- rial or protozoan infection, or even can- cer. This leads us back to what holistic animal healing is all about: caring about your animal enough to recognize the dif- ference between an isolated incident and a serious illness. THE REALITY OF DIGESTIVE UPSET Human nature dictates that anything unpleasant to any of the human senses must be immediately suppressed or ignored. To think about vomit or diar- rhea, much less look at what it contains, is virtually taboo. Humanity’s aversion toward secondhand food material is a limiting factor in the holistic care of ani- mals. If we are to care for beloved com- panions who cannot articulate how they feel, we must learn to set aside this aver- sion long enough to consider fully what vomiting and having diarrhea might actually mean in terms of their health. Is A CARDIOVASCULAR TONIC Combine the following glycerin tinctures: 2 parts hawthorn 2 parts dandelion leaf 1 part yarrow 1 part ginkgo An appropriate dose for dogs, cats, and other small animals is 0.05–1.0 milliliter for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight daily. Horses and other large herbivores can receive 20–30 milliliters daily. If more practical, horses and other large herbivores can be fed 1–2 liters of the fresh herbs daily (in lieu of the tincture formula). In addition to this formula, dietary supplementation of garlic may be of benefit to the animal. Herbs for Pets 230 that mess on the sofa just a wad of grass or a hair ball, or does it contain blood (which sometimes looks like coffee grounds), worms, or thick yellow dis- charge? Forcing yourself to thoroughly examine the mess rather than covering it up immediately with half a roll of paper towels might make the difference between health and sickness for your companion. The conventional way of dealing with digestive upset is to suppress the uncom- fortable or unpleasant symptoms. For diarrhea, there are stool hardeners. For constipation, there are laxatives. For vomiting, there are antiemetic drugs. But from a holistic perspective, the para- mount question of what caused the problem in the first place remains unan- swered with these approaches. In fact, stopping the body’s efforts to purge itself may do more harm than good. If your animal is experiencing chronic diarrhea or is vomiting but is exhibiting no other signs of disease, try changing his diet. Oftentimes when an animal is placed on a natural diet, these occur- rences are greatly diminished or eliminat- ed altogether. Food supplementation with digestive probiotics and enzymes often helps too. If your animal’s stool or vomit looks odd or if the situation is severe or persistent, see your veterinarian immediately. APPETITE LOSS (ANOREXIA) AND MALABSORPTION Loss of appetite in animals is seen in many different illnesses. It can be very dangerous for cats, who may suffer from hepatic lipidosis, a degenerative condi- tion where the liver becomes congested and dysfunctional from a rapid buildup of fat. A cat with hepatic lipidosis loses his ability to use stored fat, and as a result, the body utilizes its own muscle mass as a source of protein. About 35 percent of cats with this disease eventu- ally die from it. If your companion chooses not to eat, don’t jump to conclusions and panic. For various reasons, some animals may natu- rally decide to fast. Fasting should be allowed if it doesn’t continue for more than a few days and as long as the animal seems healthy in all other ways. Keep a close eye for signs of weakness, weight loss, fever, runny eyes, or any other signs of ill health. If after a few days of fasting your companion is still turning up his nose to his favorite treats, assume that something is wrong—even if he seems otherwise healthy—and get to a vet! A gum or tooth infection, ulcers of the mouth, periods of strenuous exer- cise, or warm weather may cause decreased appetite. Intestinal parasites, digestive ulcers, tumors or other masses, digestive flora imbalances, bacterial or fungal infections, and liver dysfunction are just a few causes of appetite loss. Your companion also may be depressed or simply bored with his diet. In other words, the possibilities are endless and some are life threatening. If your com- panion isn’t eating and you can’t pin- point the cause on your own within a few days, the best course of action is to consult your holistic veterinarian for medical help. It’s difficult to generalize about how to approach appetite loss because the possible causes are too diverse and extensive. It is safe to say, however, that vitamins, probiotics, and enzyme supple- ments play important roles in animals who aren’t cleaning their plates. In addi- tion, a few herbs stand out in their abili- ties to stimulate appetite and improve nutrient absorption in the digestive sys- tems of some animals. One such herb is yucca, which contains saponin con- stituents that are believed to increase nutrient permeability in the small intes- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 231 tine while at the same time stimulating appetite. By improving the absorption of nutrients, animals who are eating less are able to make the best use of the food they do eat. Alfalfa is another herb to consider—it is nutritious and is also regarded as an appetite stimulant in ani- mals. Both yucca and alfalfa should be used in moderation (especially with hors- es), as they may actually cause digestive upset or bloat if fed in too much abun- dance. Bitter herbs such as gentian, dan- delion, and Oregon grape may help get the digestive juices flowing to trigger an increase in appetite, as might pepper- mint, fennel, or garlic. COLIC AND FLATULENCE The term colic is generic, referring to any condition that causes pain, inflam- mation, or other discomfort in the colon. Most commonly, colic is caused by flatulence (trapped gas), which is usually associated with abdominal dis- tention and irritability. Colic is most often caused by something the animal ingested, but bacterial, fungal, or para- sitic infection may also be the cause, as could a deficiency in liver or gallbladder functions or an ulcer, a tumor, or an injury somewhere in the digestive tract. Regardless of the onset, colic can be especially serious in horses—so serious that herbs may not act fast enough to prevent a life-threatening situation. If your horse is suffering from colic, call your vet immediately! To find a long-term solution to colic (especially chronic, recurring cases), you must first identify the underlying causes. Then and only then can a holistic, long- term solution be found. Until you find the answer, it is possible to relieve the uncomfortable symptoms of colic with herbs. The first course of remedial action is to aid in the elimination of excess gas and help reduce pain and spasms in the colon. Chamomile, fennel, dill, catnip, or peppermint are all good choices for this. If inflammation appears to be part of the problem, slippery elm, plantain, marsh- mallow, raspberry leaf, certified organic goldenseal, or nettle may help. If an ulcer is suspected, licorice lends antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties that are especially well suited for the problem. If giardiasis, E. coli, or some other form of parasitic, bacterial, or fungal infection is part of the problem, consider combining Oregon grape or goldenseal tincture with an equal amount of licorice tincture (0.5–1 milliliter for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight, twice daily). This helps inhibit the invading microbes while speeding the healing of digestive mucosa. Fresh echinacea can be especial- ly helpful for horses suffering from colic of bacterial origin—allow the animals to eat as much of the fresh plants (roots, flowers, and all) as they intuitively desire. DIARRHEA Diarrhea is caused by an overabundance of fluid entering the intestinal tract. This in turn can interfere with the digestion process and may result in malabsorption Dill expels intestinal gas and soothes the stomach. Herbs for Pets 232 and severe dehydration if left unad- dressed. From a holistic perspective, diar- rhea is a by-product of systemic dysfunc- tion or the body’s effort to deal with some form of excess. Normally, nutrients pass through intestinal mucous mem- branes to enter the bloodstream. To aid in this metabolic process, the mem- branes allow a measured amount of water, bile, and other digestive fluids to enter the intestinal tract from the oppo- site direction (from the body). When too much fluid is allowed to enter the intes- tinal tract for whatever reason, loose stool is the result. Conversely, when too little fluid is allowed into the intestinal tract, constipation occurs. The standard, symptomatic ap- proach to diarrhea is to inhibit the entrance of fluid into the intestinal tract. This is usually accomplished with the use of astringent herbs or drugs—those that cause contraction (shrinking) of mucous membranes. By quickly shrink- ing intestinal membranes, excess fluid is prohibited from entering the digestive tract, and the stool firms up. If herbs are the medicine of choice, those contain- ing large amounts of tannin con- stituents, such as uva ursi, rose bark, or white oak bark, are generally the quick- est acting. The problem is that these and most other “tannin heavyweights” can be irritating to the stomach and kid- neys and therefore must be used only for a short duration—about a day or two at a time. The better approach is to be patient. Try gentler astringents first, such as chamomile or raspberry leaf. If these fail, try slippery elm or plantain (our favorite)—these herbs combine their tannin constituents with the sooth- ing and protecting effects of mucilage. If these herbs fail, try combining one of the aforementioned astringents with an equal amount of marshmallow root. The soothing, mucilaginous quality of the marshmallow helps moderate the irritat- ing effect of the tannins. With all of that said, it’s now time to reconsider the use of astringents alto- gether. Remember, the goal of holistic herbal medicine is to assist the body in its abilities to correct and heal itself. When we use astringent herbs to treat diarrhea, we are only suppressing the body’s response to deeper problems. Plus, we have to consider that the diar- rhea actually might be part of the body’s natural healing process. The bot- tom line is this: if your animal is suffer- ing from a sudden onset of diarrhea, try to make lifestyle arrangements that allow you to live with the situation for a day or two—until it passes. Encourage your animal to drink plenty of water, restrict salt intake, and let nature take its course. If bacterial infection or giar- A BASIC FORMULA FOR COLIC Combine the following ingredients either as teas, tinctures, or dried herbs: 1 part fennel seed 1 part marshmallow root 1 part chamomile An appropriate starting dose for most dogs is either 1 tablespoon of the dried herbs, 1 milliliter of a low- alcohol tincture combination, or 2 tablespoons of a strong tea sprin- kled on a small amount of food, twice daily. Cats should receive half of the dog dose. Horses and other herbivores can be fed 2–4 cups of the dried herbs or 4–8 cups of the fresh herbs daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 233 diasis is the suspected cause, Oregon grape or certified organic goldenseal might help solve the problem. Regardless of what you might suspect, if the problem persists or worsens, take your companion to a holistic vet for a thorough examination. At the very least, have the stool analyzed for the presence of blood, worms, or other evidence of deeper health problems, and be sure that the animal is drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration. Once the underlying causes are identified, a holistic course of action can be directed at the root cause (not the symptoms) of the problem. CONSTIPATION Constipation is usually caused when the body is unable to fully digest food or when other materials cause a blockage. If an animal is receiving a healthy, well-bal- anced diet, constipation should not be a problem, and contrary to what many conventional dog and cat care texts may say, a healthy diet should include fresh raw bones from an organic source, if pos- sible. The idea that raw bones cause digestive blockages in dogs and cats is untrue, at least if the animal is healthy to start with. Carnivores are naturally designed to digest and metabolize bones. If they can’t digest them and con- stipation occurs, it’s because their diges- tive system is not working efficiently (or perhaps they’re eating too many bones). In treating constipation, the first step is to rule out the possibility that your companion ate something he shouldn’t have—such as a piece of wood; pine nee- dles; some tough dry grass; or perhaps that heirloom tapestry that was handed down through your family for fifteen generations. If ingestion of “something different” is ruled out, then look deeper for some sort of interrelated problem. Start with a thorough reevaluation of diet and make sure that your animal is receiv- ing the enzymes and probiotics needed for healthy digestive flora. Try feeding your companion some organic, live-cul- tured yogurt. Eating yogurt activates reproduction of digestive flora and often has quick and natural laxative effects. If the animal is straining to pass stool, then some ground flaxseed, psyllium husk, or marshmallow root might help lubricate the intestines. Feed 1⁄4 teaspoon of any of these herbs for each 20 pounds of an animal’s weight along with plenty of water. Fresh chickweed can be fed to horses, goats, llamas, dogs, cats, birds, and other animals for a gentle laxative and soothing effect. A TONIC FORMULA FOR CHRONIC CONSTIPATION Combine the following as either dried herbs, low-alcohol tinctures, or strong teas: 2 parts dandelion root 2 parts marshmallow root 1 part Oregon grape 1 part yellow dock 1 part fennel (to relieve any associated gas or griping) *This diet should be supplemented with flaxseed or psyllium husks. For dogs, try 1 teaspoon of the strong, combined, cooled teas or 1 milliliter of the tincture per 30 pounds of body weight, two or three times daily. Cats can receive 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 teaspoon of the strong, combined, cooled teas or 0.25–0.50 milliliters of the tincture per 15 pounds of body weight, two or three times daily. Herbs for Pets 234 Chronic constipation is often a cumu- lative effect of liver or gallbladder con- gestion or dysfunction. If bile production is reduced in the liver, or if the gallblad- der or a bile duct is blocked by solid waste or inflammation, then the diges- tive tract cannot receive the chemicals it needs to effectively break down food materials. The result is constipation. Again, this condition is usually caused by one or more elements of the diet (such as low-grade protein or too much fat) that cannot be effectively digested and metabolized. Aside from a change in diet, the herbal approach is to improve bile production and transport with chol- agogue herbs such as dandelion root and Oregon grape. If the problem is believed to be associated with liver damage or inflammation, milk thistle, turmeric, or licorice should be added to the program to help protect and regenerate liver cells. Essential fatty acids, such as those found in the oils of flaxseed, evening primrose, and borage, serve critical roles in liver repair as well. By now you may have noticed that we have not mentioned the use of laxative herbs. This is because constipation is almost always a by-product of a deeper problem for which a laxative can serve only as a symptomatic quick fix. The strongest laxative herbs are those con- taining anthraquinone constituents. Anthraquinones stimulate peristalsis— spasmodic smooth-muscle contractions of the bowels. In effect, these spasms force stool out of the body, causing uncomfortable cramping, griping pain, gas, and loss of smooth-muscle tone. With long-term use, laxatives can even cause digestive dependency (i.e., your animal will not be able to pass stool with- out the laxative). Since the holistic approach to animal health is focused on assisting (as opposed to forcing) the body with its natural functions, strong laxatives such as senna, aloe, cascara sagrada, and turkey rhubarb should be reserved for times when all else fails and bowel movement is an immediate neces- sity. Before resorting to any of these herbs, give yellow dock a try. Although it too contains considerable amounts of anthraquinones, it tends to be much more gentle, and it imparts liver and digestive stimulating qualities that add to its value in treating constipation. We find it especially effective when used in small proportions with liver tonic herbs, such as dandelion root. Finally, when encountering constipa- tion in pregnant animals, the safest approach is to avoid anything that con- tains anthraquinones. Instead, look to marshmallow, chickweed, flaxseed, or psyllium husks to provide colonic lubrica- tion without stressing the reproductive organs or the fetus. Horses and other herbivores seldom get constipated, but they commonly suf- fer from various other forms of colic. When these animals do get constipated, it’s usually attributable to poor-quality feed or forage or to the ingestion of sand, gravel, and other nonorganic materials. In these circumstances, dietary supple- mentation with a few tablespoons of ground or finely chopped marshmallow, flaxseed, or psyllium husks usually assist with elimination. HAIR BALLS Anyone who has been licked by a cat knows that felines have rough, “barbed” tongues. This makes it difficult for them to spit hair out after each of their hun- dred or so daily baths, so they must swal- low the hair. This in turn may lead to vomiting and the possibility of intestinal obstructions. One conventional approach to hair balls is to feed the affected cat some petroleum jelly, a practice we feel is espe- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 235 cially dangerous because the jelly, being totally insoluble in water, can be aspirat- ed into the lungs of a choking or vomit- ing cat and cause life-threatening pneu- monia. Other approaches employ laxa- tives, the theory being that the hair balls can be expeditiously eliminated out the opposite end of the kitty. Again we frown—the poor cat is having a tough enough time without suffering a caretak- er-induced case of intestinal cramping and diarrhea. Fortunately, there are some safe and effective actions you can take to help your feline eliminate hair balls more easi- ly. Foremost is a well-balanced, raw food diet. Raw meats, bones, and vegetables contain the fiber and roughage necessary to bind with ingested hair and carry it out of the body. Giving 1⁄4 teaspoon of bran, psyllium husks, or ground flaxseed also provides fiber and lubricating mucilage to help remove hair balls. Giving 1⁄2 teaspoon of marshmallow root tea or 12–20 drops of the glycerin tinc- ture will likely help lubricate the process as well. If your cat will eat marshmallow root au natural, 1⁄4–1⁄2 teaspoon of fresh or dried root can be finely chopped and added to Kitty’s food for a similar effect. Adding a teaspoon of olive oil to the food can be helpful too. For rabbits who get intestinal obstruc- tions of fur, a common practice by some rabbit caretakers is to feed pineapple juice to “melt” the fur away. The fur pass- ing more easily is probably due to the enzymatic action of the juice, and sup- plementing with digestive enzymes would most likely work in a similar fash- ion when used as a preventative. INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Inflammatory bowel disease and colitis involve mucosal inflammation of the colon. Animals with inflammatory bowel disease often suffer from severe diarrhea, labored or painful bowel movements, gastric distention, and rectal bleeding or mucus discharge. In cats, the problem is sometimes labeled Crohn’s disease. Causes are often difficult to pinpoint, even with the best diagnostic methods. Immune system disorders, circulatory impairment in the intestinal tract, para- sitic infections, defects in permeability of the intestinal wall, dietary sensitivities, or adverse drug reactions are all part of a long list of causative possibilities. Conventional approaches to inflam- matory bowel disease include feeding a controlled diet that may include supple- mental dietary fiber and the use of corti- costeroids and other immunosuppressive drugs. In cats, inflammation is often treated with sulfasalazine (Azulfidine), a compound that is also used in humans for similar disorders. Natural therapies usually start with adjustments in diet and supplementation with vitamins and probiotics that support digestion and moderate immune system activities. A daily regimen of n-acetylglu- cosamine (250–1,500 milligrams), glut- amine (250–3,000 milligrams), Lacto- bacillus acidophilus (20–500 million microorganisms), proanthocyanidin complex (10–200 milligrams), dimethyl- glycine (50–250 milligrams), and vita- min C (250–3000 milligrams) represents one suggested nutritional therapy for dogs and cats. Papaya supplements may also prove beneficial in improving diges- tion, but care must be taken to assure that any or all of these supplements do not cause or worsen diarrhea. The symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease can often be relieved with the same herbs we recommend for treating gastritis. Because reduction of mucosal inflammation is of critical importance, anti-inflammatory and demulcent herbs such as licorice, slip- pery elm, plantain, marshmallow, Herbs for Pets 236 flaxseed, and psyllium husks may be especially useful. Aloe vera juice or cal- endula may also relieve the discomforts of inflammatory bowel disease. Certified organic goldenseal may help to reduce mucosal inflammation. Astragalus is well suited for immune support in cases in which infection may be involved because it tends not to overstimulate the immune system when an increased autoimmune response may already be a contributing factor in the inflammation. LEAKY GUT SYNDROME (INTESTINAL DYSBIOSIS AND HYPERPERMEABILITY) Leaky gut is a term used for a condition in which food compounds abnormally permeate intestinal barriers to enter the bloodstream. Oftentimes, this leads to an immediate defensive attack by the immune system and severe food aller- gies. In some cases, systemic infection, arthritis, seborrhea, or other forms of autoimmune disease may result. Leaky gut syndrome has many causes, any number of which may be secondary to another. Poor diet; excessive use of antibiotic drugs; or bacterial, parasitic, or fungal infections may alter digestive flora to the point that intestinal mucosal barri- ers will be vulnerable and weakened by certain food-carried chemicals. The prob- lem may also be caused by chronic inflammatory bowel disease—when the intestinal mucosa is inflamed, its structur- al integrity may be altered in a way that allows unusually large food particles, bac- teria, parasites, fungi (such as Candida albicans), or protozoa to cross intestine- blood barriers. The most effective approach to avoid leaky gut is with a natural diet that con- tains all of the probiotic elements neces- sary for healthy digestive flora, struc- ture, and function. Research has shown that glutamine, a fatty acid component, plays important roles in maintaining gut tonicity, thus reducing the possibility of leaky gut. One study concluded that animals deprived of glutamine were more likely to suffer sepsis, bacterial infection of the blood. Leaky gut can be progressive and debilitating shortly after onset. The holistic approach toward correcting the problem is to provide supplemental measures of digestive probiotics to build intestinal flora and strengthen mucosal barriers. Plantain, marshmallow, rasp- berry leaf, certified organic goldenseal, and chamomile can be used to reduce inflammation, tonify intestinal mucosa, and provide an additional barrier against invading microbes. Flaxseed is also strongly indicated, as it provides A FORMULA FOR INFLAMMATORY BOWEL DISEASE Combine the following as either teas, tinctures, or dried herbs: 2 parts slippery elm or plantain 1 part marshmallow root 1 part licorice 1 part fennel seed For dogs, 1 tablespoon of the dried herbs, 1 milliliter of a low-alcohol tincture combination, or 2 table- spoons of a strong tea can be fed twice daily. Cats should receive half the dog dose. Horses and other her- bivores can be fed 2–4 cups of the dried herbs or 4–8 cups of the fresh herbs daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 237 soothing, cleansing, and protective mucilage and fiber constituents as well as an added measure of mucosa- strengthening omega-3 fatty acids. Ear Problems Ear problems most commonly come in the form of bacterial or fungal infections, mites, fleas, or foreign objects (foxtails, dirt, etc.) lodged in the ear canal. Some other com- mon problems include hematoma of the earflap and tumors of the inner ear. Mullein flower, Oregon grape, garlic, marshmallow, ginkgo, and yarrow are especially well suited for treating infec- tions and parasite infestations of the ear. Mullein flower, garlic, and Oregon grape are all strong antimicrobials with strong affinities toward inhibition of mites and various pathogens that may cause ear problems. The slippery oily mucilage of marshmallow root provides soothing relief and a protective, antimicrobial bar- rier on inflamed tissues of the outer ear. Yarrow is especially useful for treating small hematomas of the earflap. Used externally, the oil helps strengthen exteri- or capillary walls, while internal doses of yarrow and ginkgo tea or tincture improve capillary circulation and internal tonicity. Witch hazel may also be effective for external treatment of earflap hematomas, as its strong astringency quickly constricts weak or inflamed blood vessels. Elderly Animal Care What is considered old for a pet? We know that to a certain degree longevity varies with the type, size, and breed of an animal. For example, a small dog may live into his teens, while a larger breed of dog may be entering his golden years at only seven or eight years of age. But for those of us who strive to understand what life must be like from the animal’s perspective, a different question comes to mind: What would our pets them- selves regard as old age? We all grow old. Various body parts become fatigued from oxidation and wear and tear, systemic efficiency begins to decline, and certain bodily functions sim- ply don’t work as well as they used to. But how much of the aging process is actually relative to time and physiological degener- ation, and how much is the result of sur- rendering to the thought of being old and feeble? We raise this question on behalf of the animals who have taught us just how carefree and fun the latter part of life can really be. Unlike humans, animals age without even considering the concepts of mortality and personal vanity, and those of us who pay close enough attention to them can gain some precious insight about what being old really means. ANTIMICROBIAL AND ANTIPARASITIC EAR OIL Combine equal amounts of the following oil infusions: Mullein flower Oregon grape Garlic Marshmallow You can add 10–20 drops of vitamin E oil to this mixture to act as a pre- servative and aid in skin healing. For ear mites or infections of fungal or bacterial origin, 6–12 drops of the oil can be applied to affected areas of the earflap or ear canal. A soft plastic dropper is best for applica- tion into the ear canal, while a piece of soft cotton, gauze, or even clean fingertips will suffice as an external applicator. Herbs for Pets 238 For humans, old age is as much a product of mind-set as it is of physical cir- cumstances. To animals, the entire idea of “yielding to the wheels of time” does not apply—an elderly animal does not live in anticipation of death but in cele- bration of life. As his human guardians roll their tired old bodies out of bed in the morning and moan, groan, and com- plain about their hemorrhoids, the elder- ly dog waits by the door virtually shout- ing, “Who cares about not having teeth anymore? There’s a squirrel out there and it’s near my doghouse! Let’s go get him!” There are some powerful lessons about life and happiness here. Chronic diseases are often disregard- ed as just a part of growing old. In fact, many pet owners see their animals’ old age as a downhill slide to inevitable suf- fering and death. As a result of this mind- set, countless numbers of animals are euthanized not because their time has naturally passed but because their guardians are fearful of watching the ani- mals grow old and die a natural death. Granted, it’s difficult to live in anticipa- tion of a companion’s death, but all things considered, this is really our prob- lem, not theirs. The fact that an animal is growing old and becoming more susceptible to illness does not automatically predis- pose him to chronic disease, it just means that he needs some added care and attention. With your loving support, your old best friend can enjoy life right up to his last day. We are firm believers that animals who receive plenty of love and atten- tion, a wholesome homemade diet, a minimum of vaccinations, and holistic measures of health care throughout their lives can beat the odds of longevi- ty set by genetics, breeding, and physi- cal size. By affording them the elements of sustained health and well-being, ani- mals reward us before and after they pass from our lives. They leave us with the peace of mind that comes from knowing that their lives were totally ful- filled by kindhearted and respectful human beings who cared enough to allow them to live and age gracefully and innocently—as animals do. HERBAL THERAPIES Most chronic problems seen in elderly animals are the results of poor or incom- plete nutrition. Liver problems, chronic renal failure, diabetes, arthritis and hip dysplasia, and neurological problems (such as canine cognitive dysfunction) are just a few of the conditions that may be prevented by lifelong good nutrition. Tailor a dietary program to your com- Providing your pet with a healthful diet, holistic lifestyle, and a lifetime of love can help him enjoy his later years. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 239 panion’s specific needs as early as possi- ble. Each month of nutritional deficien- cy can trim healthy years from the latter end of your animal’s life. A holistic vet- erinarian can assist you in determining the proper diet and nutrients for the age, physical condition, and lifestyle of your companion. In older animals, herbs are especially useful for providing added support to body functions and systems that are becoming less efficient. Nothing can compare with spirulina or other forms of blue-green algae for tonic nutritional support of an aging body. Astragalus is an especially well-suited general tonic for older animals because it provides a meas- ured degree of immune system support while also strengthening the animal’s resistance to stress. Garlic serves this pur- pose as well, but added care must be exercised in assuring that it does not cause digestive upset in elderly animals. The liver and digestive organs endure a lifetime of abusive environmental tox- ins and systemic waste materials, so it stands to reason that they will eventually begin to fail in the later years of life. To support liver and digestive functions, an animal’s diet should be frequently reeval- uated and adjusted as needed to accom- modate any reduction in these organs’ metabolic capacities. Additionally, diges- tion and waste elimination can be improved with digestive enzymes and mild liver stimulants, such as dande- lion or burdock root. These help with the removal of solid wastes from the body while increasing the production of bile and digestive enzymes. Marshmallow root, fed fresh, dried, or in any form of low-alcohol liquid, aids in the passage of stool by providing a protective, anti-inflammatory, and lubricating barrier to the intestinal mucosa. Flaxseed or psyllium husks work in a similar manner as well. The kidneys have a difficult life too because they must filter and eliminate waste from the blood over the course of a lifetime. Over time they may become scarred and dysfunctional from repetitive infections, stones, and other damaging influences that may or may not have been detected earlier. To increase urinary efficiency and help strengthen mucous membranes in the urinary tract, a tea of dandelion leaf, nettle, cleavers, or parsley leaf can be added to the animal’s drink- ing water—just enough to noticeably tint the water. Giving one of these herbs pro- vides alterative qualities that the animal’s body can selectively utilize to eliminate waste and maintain clean, well-nourished blood. This can be done every day for the remainder of the animal’s life. If the animal displays early symptoms of renal failure, twice-daily doses of gink- go and hawthorn help to improve blood circulation and reduce blood pressure in the kidneys, while corn silk, marshmal- low, and plantain help to reduce any inflammation. Oatstraw serves as an excellent nerv- ous system tonic that can be fed daily to help improve and regulate nerve trans- mission. In animals who display dimin- ished mental clarity or odd behavior that is attributable to brain dysfunction (e.g., cognitive dysfunction in canines) blood circulation and neurological functions of the brain can be assisted and sometimes improved with the use of ginkgo, gotu kola, or peppermint. In certain cases, Saint-John’s-wort may be beneficial as well, but this determination should be made by a holistic veterinarian who is familiar with your animal. Aches, pains, and loss of mobility that result from joint and connective tis- sue degeneration may be relieved with supplements of glucosamine or chon- droitin sulfate, horsetail, or yucca root. In cases of arthritis flare-ups, licorice, Herbs for Pets 240 devil’s claw, or boswellia may bring symptomatic relief. Cardiovascular efficiency can be sup- ported with daily supplementation of hawthorn berries. If circulatory impair- ment is evident in the legs, ears, or tail of the animal, ginkgo, yarrow, or cayenne may be of assistance. The Animal Essentials dry herb and vitamin formula is also a good broad-spectrum daily supplement. WHEN THE END IS NEAR If your companion receives a good diet, plenty of exercise, and a lot of loving attention, chances are excellent that he will live happily to a ripe old age. However, any animal guardian must be prepared for the inevitable end. This can involve the need for you to make the weighty and difficult decision of whether your pet’s death should be kindly assist- ed. This choice is ultimately up to you, and there’s no easy way around it. Recently, there has been some interest in hospices for animals, similar to the hos- pices we are familiar with for people. Vets become involved in the hospice-care team and help teach a caregiver how to maintain and care for an animal who is dying in the home. It can make the dying experience much less confusing for both the animal and his guardian. Endocrine System and Related Problems The endocrine system consists of glandu- lar organs and structures that are situat- ed throughout the body, each of which produces and secretes specific hormones and other substances for distribution via the blood or lymph. The specific sub- stances produced by the various compo- nents of the endocrine system play key roles in activating or regulating organ functions and countless other metabolic activities and balances throughout the body. If one or more components of this complex and interrelated system fails, a chain reaction of dysfunction can be trig- gered throughout the body. Because endocrine system diseases and disorders can affect a wide variety of organs and functions throughout the body, such conditions are easily misdiag- nosed and often written off as behavioral disorders or dietary problems. The insidi- ous nature of endocrine disease is com- pounded by its typically slow progres- sion, and oftentimes a problem is not accurately identified until the animal’s condition is irreversible. This is when lov- ing attentiveness and a well-kept diary by a holistic caregiver can really pay off. By noticing and addressing subtle symp- toms when they first occur, a guardian can take corrective measures against most endocrine system problems before they become life threatening. ADRENAL GLAND DISORDERS The adrenal glands produce various hor- mones that are important in nervous sys- tem functions, regulation of the immune system, and bodily responses to stressful situations. The adrenal cortex (the outer tissues of the adrenal glands) is chiefly responsible for the body’s production of corticosteroids, the hormones responsi- ble for natural control of inflammation. Addison’s Disease (Hypoadrenocorticism) Addison’s disease is caused by deficient secretion of cortisone and other hor- mones from the adrenal cortex. The cause of the disease is unknown, but it may be secondary to an immune system disorder that is responsible for destroying the adrenal glands. Usually the disease progresses slowly, allowing an attentive caregiver to take remedial action early. Secondary hypoadrenocorticism is caused when synthetic corticosteroids An Herbal Repertory for Animals 241 are introduced into the body, natural adrenal functions are replaced, and the adrenal cortex subsequently begins to shut down. Many animals who are finish- ing prednisolone or other steroid thera- pies or animals who have been subjected to excessive vaccinations suffer from this form of hypoadrenocorticism. Addison’s disease occurs most fre- quently in middle-aged female dogs. It rarely occurs in cats. Early symptoms may be subtle and include occasional lack of appetite, digestive upset, and decreased energy and stamina. In many cases, symptoms may be apparent only during or after an activity that causes physical or psychological stress, such as a car ride, a frightening encounter with a big, mean dog, or a dreaded trip to the vet. Symptoms progressively worsen over time until the slightest measure of stress may result in debilitation. Degeneration of the adrenal glands is generally irreversible, but if the nutrients needed for maintaining a healthy body and balanced immune system are provid- ed, progression of the disease can be slowed dramatically. An organic raw food diet, free from pesticide residues, antibi- otics, and livestock growth or milk pro- duction hormones, is likely to yield the best results. Additionally, a high-quality dietary supplement that contains a full complement of vitamins, minerals, and EFAs is strongly indicated. Supplemental feeding of dried nettle, dandelion leaf, or parsley leaf provides the body with an array of vitamins and minerals that are essential in maintaining strong adrenal functions. Any or all of these herbs can be mixed with the animal’s food—1 level teaspoon per pound of food fed daily. Spirulina is also an excellent supplement for adrenal care—1⁄4 teaspoon for each pound of food fed daily. An excellent herb and vitamin supplement called Animal Essentials is well suited for animals that have Addison’s disease or diabetes mellitus. Borage leaf may help gently boost adrenal output, particularly in cases asso- ciated with extended steroid therapies. Licorice offers a much stronger boost to adrenal function. It’s important to note, however, that these herbs only stimulate adrenal function, they do not repair or adequately nourish the glands. Siberian ginseng or other adaptogenic herbs may be useful for reducing the impact of stress upon the adrenal glands. Cushing’s Disease (Hyperadrenocorticism) The opposite of Addison’s disease is Cushing’s disease in which overactive adrenal glands produce too much corti- sone and other hormones. This is most commonly caused (in about 85 percent of all cases) by a malignant or benign tumor of the pituitary gland. The tumor causes the pituitary to overproduce a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland, causing Cushing’s disease. The disease may also be caused by excessive use of corticosteroid drugs or by a tumor of one or both adrenal glands. Cushing’s disease occurs in dogs, cats, horses, and other animals. The condition progresses with tumor growth. Symptoms include increased thirst and appetite; increased urination; abdomi- nal distention; increased panting; obe- sity; muscle weakness; hair loss; and dry, scaly, or wrinkled skin. Conventional treatment is based on the diagnosis of the cause. In cases that stem from a pituitary or adrenal gland tumor, surgical removal or drug therapies are both options. The prognosis is vari- able according to the amount of disease progression. Herbal therapy is limited to tonic sup- port of organs and systems that are sub- jected to additional stress because of the Herbs for Pets 242 disease. Dandelion root, burdock, garlic, and nettle are good choices for support- ing an overtaxed liver and digestive sys- tem and to help replace potassium that is lost as a result of increased urination. Adaptogenic herbs such as Siberian gin- seng or astragalus help buffer adrenal responses to stress. Kelp is especially use- ful for maintaining iodine and other trace mineral levels that are essential for adre- nal function. If your companion has Cushing’s disease, avoid licorice, borage leaf, and other herbs that stimulate adre- nal activity. DIABETES MELLITUS Diabetes comes in many forms, each requiring specific courses of treatment. To simplify, the most common form of diabetes (diabetes mellitus) occurs when the pancreas becomes dysfunctional and produces too little insulin. Because of this deficit, the body is unable to effectively utilize or store the glucose, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates needed to maintain homeostasis. Consequently, serious im- balances are triggered throughout the body. If left untreated, animals with dia- betes mellitus suffer and are likely to suc- cumb to kidney failure, loss of vision, or any number of autoimmune, heart, or nervous system problems. Unfortunately, there is no cure for dia- betes. Conventional treatment of ad- vanced cases usually involves insulin replacement therapy. This approach can be effective, but all too often other rela- tive factors are never addressed. These factors include special trace mineral or EFA needs that arise from special de- mands placed upon overworked organs, as well as kidney damage that has already occurred from the disease. Diabetic animals should receive regu- lar exercise and good, wholesome food fed in small amounts, several times throughout the day. By ingesting many small meals, the body has an easier time producing, using, and stabilizing insulin and glucose levels. Dietary yeast may be added to the animal’s diet to aid in the metabolism of glucose, and 25 to 200 IU of vitamin E each day may help reduce an animal’s insulin requirement. For dogs and cats, a daily regimen of 50–300 micrograms of chromium; 500–6,000 milligrams of vitamin C; 4–160 mil- ligrams of digestive enzymes; 200–1,500 milligrams of n-acetylglucosamine; and 10–200 milligrams of proanthocyanidin complex may be of benefit as well. Regular exercise is important for main- taining healthy body weight and car- diopulmonary function and may also help decrease the animal’s insulin need. The primary role of herbs in treating diabetes is to help strengthen and sup- port systems of the body that have been ravaged by the metabolic chaos of the disease. Because a diabetic body has a diminished capacity to utilize critical nutrients, herbs that strengthen diges- tion and nutrient absorption are strongly indicated. These include bitter herbs such as dandelion leaf, chamomile (both the leaf and the flower), calendula, and hop. In addition, yucca and alfalfa are useful for increasing absorption of nutri- ents in the small intestine. Dandelion root and burdock root both contain con- siderable amounts of inulin, a compound that helps moderate and maintain blood sugar levels. Bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) or huckleberry leaf (Vaccinium sp.) may also be effective in moderating glucose levels in the blood, and a few juniper berries added to each feeding may help optimize the body’s utilization of insulin. Cardiovascular and kidney efficiency can be improved with the use of hawthorn and ginkgo. Scientific studies have shown that aloe vera and chemical com- pounds found in fenugreek seeds may also reduce blood glucose levels and An Herbal Repertory for Animals 243 stimulate insulin production in diabetic animals. Animal Essentials is an excellent herb and vitamin supplement for diabet- ic dogs and cats. PANCREATITIS The pancreas produces insulin, a sub- stance that enables the body to utilize and store glucose (the body’s fuel). It also produces pancreatic enzymes that are essential for digesting food and assimilat- ing nutrients in the digestive tract. It is a delicate organ that is easily damaged and slow to heal. Pancreatitis, inflammation of the pan- creas, can result from a high-fat diet, obesity, traumatic injury, or excessive use of corticosteroid, antibiotic, or diuretic drugs. It can also be related to underly- ing systemic problems such as liver, gall- bladder, or kidney disease; cardiovascular disease; or bacterial infection. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, restless- ness, severe vomiting and diarrhea (sometimes with blood present), dimin- ished appetite, and weakness. Onset can occur quickly (acute pancreatitis), or symptoms can progressively worsen over time (chronic pancreatitis). Pancreatitis is most common in middle-aged dogs, especially those who are overweight from being “pampered” with generous junk-food handouts. The disease is less common in cats. Natural treatment of pancreatitis is centered on diet and nutrition. To ease the inflamed organ’s burden, meals should be doled out in small portions and fed three or more times per day. Food should be served with probiotic (e.g., aci- dophilus, bifidus) and enzyme supple- ments at room temperature, which make the food easier for the animal to digest. And excess fat and foods that contribute to digestive upset should be eliminated from the diet. In addition to healthy food and food combining, daily supplements of EFAs such as stabilized flaxseed, fish oils and vitamins A and E are said to help repair and strengthen the pancreas. Meats, grains, vegetables, and fats are digested and absorbed at different meta- bolic rates, the pancreas must produce different enzymes for each. A diseased pancreas may have difficulty producing all the enzymes needed to digest a meal that includes too many food groups; so therefore, pancreatic efficiency can be optimized if each meal is composed of food types that are of similar digestibility. For example, grains and vegetables can be served together, as can grains and fruits or protein (meat) and vegetables. Meat and grains should not be combined during the same meal, however, because their digestion requirements are differ- ent. (For more information on food com- bining, pick up a copy of Keep Your Pet Healthy the Natural Way by Pat Lazarus.) Herbal therapies are best directed toward supporting organs and systems related to pancreatic function and the onset of pancreatitis. A thorough veteri- nary examination is needed to determine which therapy to use. In almost all cases, treatment of pancreatic disease requires tonic support of the liver and digestive system. Milk thistle helps to regenerate and restore normal function to a liver that is damaged as a result of drug ther- apies or infection. Dandelion, burdock root, or Oregon grape can help improve digestion and reduce pancreatic stress by gently increasing bile and enzyme pro- duction in the liver. If bacterial infection is present, echinacea helps to boost the immune system’s response to the invad- ing microbes. Yarrow is said to help reduce pancreatic inflammation and improve blood circulation to the organ. THYROID PROBLEMS The thyroid gland consists of two lobes, one located on each side of the trachea. Herbs for Pets 244 The gland secretes important hormones, including thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3), and calcitonin. Release of these hor- mones is controlled by yet another hor- mone, called thyroid stimulating hor- mone (TSH), which is produced by the pituitary gland. Thyroid hormones control the intensi- ty of critical functions throughout the body, including heart rate, body temper- ature, fat and glucose metabolism, diges- tion, and neurological activities. If the thyroid becomes dysfunctional, some serious health problems occur. Hyperthyroidism Hyperthyroidism occurs when a thyroid tumor, a viral or bacterial infection, or environmental or nutritional factors cause the thyroid gland to secrete excess hormones into the blood. Symptoms may include ravenous appetite, weight loss, increased water consumption and urination, aggressive or hyperactive behavior, and rapid or erratic heartbeat and respiration. The problem occurs more frequently in cats than in dogs or other animals. Conventional treatment of hyperthy- roidism ranges from chemotherapy to surgery to radiation therapy. One approach involves destroying the thyroid completely with radiation and then put- ting the animal on hormone replacement therapy for the rest of his life. Once the thyroid becomes damaged or dysfunctional, its condition is difficult (some say impossible) to reverse. There- fore, the best holistic approach toward hyperthyroidism is to help prevent it by providing a good natural diet and avoid- ing unnecessary chemical or environ- mental hazards, including X-rays, anti- biotic therapies, food preservatives, and unneeded vaccinations. Daily supple- ments of vitamin B complex, vitamin C, CoQ10, and EFAs are also important con- tributors for maintaining healthy thyroid function. Herbal therapies include symptomatic treatment and tonic support of systems that are under added stress from an increased metabolic rate. Bugleweed is considered a specific symptomatic reme- dy for hyperthyroidism because it is known to slow thyroid function by reduc- ing production of TSH. Its use, however, should be monitored by a holistic veteri- narian. Hawthorn is helpful for moderat- ing an erratic heartbeat, while skullcap and valerian may help calm and reduce the “jittery jumpiness” of a hyperthyroid animal. Kelp and other rich sources of iodine should be avoided because iodine stimulates thyroid function. Hypothyroidism The opposite of hyperthyroidism is hypothyroidism—deficient production of hormones by the thyroid. Hypothy- roidism is usually caused by physical degeneration of the thyroid gland, which can be the result of protracted drugs or therapies, radiation such as X-ray expo- sure, vaccinosis, genetic predisposition, or nutritional deficiencies. Hypothyroid- ism occurs rarely in cats and horses or other large animals, but it is fairly com- mon in dogs. Destruction of the thyroid is generally irreversible, and animals who are suffering advanced stages of thyroid degeneration may need hormone re- placement therapy. Symptoms of hypothyroidism include weight gain, reduced appetite, mental dullness, lack of energy, hair loss on the trunk and tail, and a dry coat that pulls easily from the skin. If left untreated, the problem can lead to chronic seizures, head tilt, lack of coordination, and other serious neurological disorders. Iodine is critical in the functions of a healthy thyroid, and many holistic practi- tioners believe that dietary supplementa- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 245 tion of iodine-rich kelp helps stimulate an underactive thyroid. Many researchers and practitioners believe, however, that supplemental iodine may contribute to immune-related factors of the disease and trigger a worsening effect. Licorice may have a slight stimulant effect on an unproductive but physically intact thyroid, and adaptogens such as organically grown ginseng, astragalus, or Siberian ginseng might help energy lev- els and the body’s response to stress. Otherwise, herb use is limited to treating the discomforts subsequent to hypothy- roidism. For instance, related digestive disorders can be treated with dandelion root, Oregon grape, or yellow dock, whereas seborrhea might be relieved by gotu kola, burdock, or red clover. In our opinion, homeopathy and the use of glandular preparations offer more effective courses of early- to late-term treatment than herbs do. Epilepsy, Convulsions, and Seizures A seizure can be frightening if you’ve never seen one before. Some animals may experience a seizure once in their lives and then never again. On the other hand, some have several seizures every day of their lives. The causes of seizures are widely var- ied, ranging from epilepsy to nervous system disease or injury. In dogs, hyper- thermia, poisoning, low blood sugar, nutritional deficiencies, distemper, intes- tinal parasites that have entered the bloodstream, tumors, low blood calcium after birthing, liver or kidney disease, and thyroid problems may be underlying fac- tors. In cats, convulsions may be linked to feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), toxo- plasmosis, lymphosarcoma (leukemia), thiamine deficiency, or a heart disorder. All cases of seizures involve electrical disturbances of the brain that result in muscle contractions of variable intensity and loss of motor control. Many animals lose consciousness and bladder or bowel control during a seizure, and some may exhibit overly affectionate, frightened, or “clingy” behavior immediately before an epileptic episode. Digestive disorders, hair loss, neuralgia, and several other problems may also be associated with chronic convulsive disorders. Conventional therapies typically involve the use of phenobarbital, potassi- um bromide, or other anticonvulsant drugs. These measures can prove to be effective, but they cannot address the underlying causes of chronic convulsive disorders. HOLISTIC APPROACHES Holistic treatment usually entails a life- long effort, beginning with a dietary and environmental assessment and adjust- ment, and continuing with nutritional supplementation and herbal therapies that focus on normalizing and maintain- Skullcap is one of several herbs that can be used to treat epilepsy. Herbs for Pets 246 ing nervous system function. All possible environmental causes of or contributors to seizures should be removed from your home. Eliminate all possible contact with antifreeze fluids, household chemicals, pesticides and herbicides, lead-based paints, and other neurotoxins from your companion’s environment. (These sub- stances are harmful to humans, as well.) Animals with epilepsy or other convul- sive disorders should be on a natural, whole foods diet. Cats with epilepsy, however, should not be fed raw fish because it contains thiaminase, an enzyme that breaks down vitamin B1 (thi- amine). Vitamin B1 is essential for healthy nervous system functions. In all animals, dietary supplementation with omega-3 and omega-6 EFAs is important in the development and maintenance of healthy nervous system structure and function. Animal Essentials makes an excellent EFA supplement for dogs and cats. In addition to EFAs, supplementing your companion’s diet with essential and nonessential vitamins, minerals, and digestive enzymes and with probiotics is indicated to assure that the nervous sys- tem is getting everything it needs to heal and function optimally. A daily supple- mentation of 100-300 milligrams of betaine HCl; 50-500 milligrams of dimethylglycine; 200-1000 milligrams of taurine; and 10-200 milligrams of proan- thocyanidin complex is said to be helpful for epileptic dogs. Recent studies have shown that a ketogenic diet can be effec- tive for treating severe epilepsy in humans, but at this point we can only speculate about the usefulness of this approach in animals. We have seen promising results with the use of skullcap in the treatment of epileptic animals. This nervine is believed to moderate overactive synaptic activity in the higher brain centers in which epileptic episodes may be triggered. We have received many good reports about valerian and oatstraw, too, especially when they are combined in equal pro- portions with skullcap. Although these herbs do not represent a cure for epilep- sy, their reported effects include less fre- quent and less severe episodes. Lemon balm, ginkgo, rosemary, hop, passion- flower, and perhaps kava kava (research is promising in the area of controlling seizures in rodents) may also be effective in the treatment of chronic seizures. Additionally, flower essences of vervain or chestnut bud may be helpful in moderat- ing seizures. FIRST AID FOR SEIZURES If your animal experiences a seizure, gen- tly protect his head from sharp or hard objects until the episode passes. Don’t attempt to restrain the animal’s body— the muscle contractions of a violent con- vulsion can be self-injurious if the animal cannot move and jerk about freely. Never place your hand in or near your animal’s mouth during a seizure—your compan- ion may be unaware of your presence and may unknowingly bite you with incredible force! If you are indoors during the episode, dimming the lights and speaking softly to your companion helps reduce the fear and confusion that some- times precedes and usually follows the episode. Rescue Remedy rubbed on the ears before, during, and after a seizure sometimes helps moderate the episode and calm the animal. Be sure to take a hearty dose yourself! Eye Problems Many eye problems are just subtle signs of chronic underlying diseases. You might think your animal is the “picture of perfect health,” but if he has runny eyes or the beginning of cataracts, these con- ditions indicate that there is an underly- ing imbalance. Many times herbs alone An Herbal Repertory for Animals 247 are not enough to correct that imbal- ance. A vet who is trained well in classic homeopathy can address the underlying disease and help the body heal itself. In some cases of simple infection or irritation, an herbal wash of saline solu- tion and raspberry leaf tea clears up the problem immediately. In other cases, eye problems mark the beginning of a life- long course of holistic therapy. CATARACTS Cataracts are white opacities that block the passage of light into the eyes. They are caused by loss of water or rearrange- ment of fibrous tissue in the eye lens. Formation of cataracts (known as senile cataracts) is a normal part of the aging process. They seldom result in blindness and usually cause little or no vision impairment in older animals, even if the pupils take on the blue-white hue that is characteristic of the condition. Cataracts sometimes involve leakage of lens pro- tein into the inner eye. When this hap- pens, an immune response is triggered and the animal suffers serious inflamma- tion of the eye. Providing a well-balanced natural diet throughout an animal’s life is the surest way to prevent the development of prob- lematic cataracts. In cats, cataracts have been linked with vitamin B2 (riboflavin) deficiency, a problem that stems more from poor nutrient assimilation than it does from lack of vitamin B2 in the aver- age feline diet. Lactation is also believed to deplete the feline body of B2. Therefore, dietary supplementation of the digestive enzymes and probiotics necessary to metabolize B2 is an impor- tant part of cataract prevention—espe- cially in nursing cats. Other recommend- ed vitamin supplements include glu- tathione, vitamin C, CoQ10, proantho- cyanidin complex, vitamin E, and dimethylglycine. A SIMPLE ASTRINGENT EYEWASH Using a clean dropper bottle, com- bine the following: 1⁄2 tsp of cooled clear raspberry leaf or nettle tea * 1⁄2 tsp of Oregon grape or goldenseal tea * Add 1 oz of sterile saline (available in the eye care section of supermar- kets and pharmacies) Shake the mixture thoroughly—the finished solution should be tinted yellow. * Make sure that the tea is absolute- ly free of particles—you don’t want them in your animal’s eyes! If possible, hold the animal’s head to one side and use a dropper pipette to thoroughly rinse the eye laterally, from the nose outward, toward the animal’s cheek. The idea is to wash any irritating particles away from the animal’s eye. This process can be repeated two or three times daily until the condition improves. If the rinse causes further irritation, stop using it—your companion may be sensitive to the herb you are using. Other herbs to consider for use in eyewashes include calendu- la, chamomile, thyme, bee balm, chickweed, dandelion leaf, or rose petals. Regardless of which herbs you use, be extra careful in assuring that they are free of dust, pollen, or toxic residues (such as herbicides or car exhaust), as the eyes are extremely sensitive to such foreign substances. Herbs for Pets 248 Both conventional and herbal approach- es to treating cataracts are limited. Conventional treatment includes cataract surgery, a procedure that can be very effec- tive. While some herbalists claim that a small dab of eucalyptus honey applied to the inside of the lower eyelid each day for sever- al weeks can reduce the opacity of the eye lens, another approach involves the internal use of an ancient Chinese herbal formula called Hachimijiogan. Animal studies have shown that Hachimijiogan is capable of slowing the progression of cataracts, espe- cially if therapy commences during early stages of the disease. Bilberry, when used in conjunction with vitamin E supplements, has been shown to help stop progression of senile cataracts in humans. In this approach, a standardized (to 25 percent anthocyano- sides) bilberry extract is administered at a dose of 20-40 milligrams per 40 pounds of body weight, three times daily. According to veterinarian Susan G. Wynn, homeopathic preparation eye- drops made from the juice of Cineraria maritima can be effective for eliminating cataracts in animals. Wynn says to dilute the drops by half with artificial tears (ster- ile saline solution) because the juice stings when used full strength. When using this method, she sometimes sees cataracts disappear in two to three months. CONJUNCTIVITIS Conjunctivitis is a generic term that refers to inflammation of the mucous mem- branes and soft tissues surrounding the eye. The problem occurs when bacteria, fungi, or other foreign substances come in contact with these tissues and tearing fails to eliminate the irritating elements. Most cases are acute and are caused by dust, plant material, or other environ- mental irritants. In these cases, a simple saline eye rinse usually brings relief. An astringent eyewash using raspberry leaf or nettle tea combined with a tea of cer- tified organic goldenseal or Oregon grape root offers further assistance by An herbal wash may clear up a simple eye infection or irritation. Homeopathic eyedrops may eliminate cataracts. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 249 fighting infection and quickly reducing inflammation and soreness. GLAUCOMA Glaucoma involves abnormally high inner eye pressure. It can occur in most animals, but it is especially common in cats and in certain breeds of dogs. The disease is often secondary to other intraocular diseases such as inflammatory adhesions and tumors. Signs of glauco- ma may include swollen or reddened eyes, dilated fixed pupils, loss of vision, and corneal edema. Conventional approaches to glaucoma usually involve antiglaucoma drugs that help reduce intraocular pressure. In some cases, corti- costeroid therapies are used. Although glaucoma is difficult to treat with herbs, perhaps the greatest success comes from the reduction of intraocular pressure with herbs such as ginkgo and bilberry. Cannabis sativa (marijuana) can be effective, too, but, of course, its accessibility is severely limited by legal restrictions. Coleus forskohlii, an herb that’s used in ayurvedic medicine, contains forskolin, a substance that has been shown to signif- icantly reduce intraocular pressure in humans, monkeys, and rabbits. However, its safety and effectiveness in various other animals have yet to be determined. First Aid BE PREPARED! The old scout motto “Be Prepared” real- ly rings true if you’re out walking your dog and he is attacked by another dog, cuts himself on barbed wire, or sprains his paw while playing Frisbee. Having a first aid kit specially designed for your animal and knowing how to use it pro- vides insurance for the well-being of your companion. Taking a course from the Red Cross or a local vet, kennel, or shel- ter enables you to deal with everything from life-threatening emergencies to minor cuts and sprains. In addition to the basic first aid neces- sities (plenty of gauze dressings and IDEAS FOR A FIRST AID KIT Place some of the following items in a water-resistant carrying case: • Blankets, extra collars, leashes, muzzles, water bowls • Gauze, bandages, small flashlight, scissors, tweezers, swabs, Vetwrap™, hemostats, rectal ther- mometer (with case), ear scope, hydrogen peroxide (for use as an emetic in certain poisonings, as well as an antibacterial wound wash), activated charcoal powder (for poisonings); preserved, sterile saline solution (for washing out wounds and eyes and to wash minor burns) • Herbal salve, Rescue Remedy, cayenne pepper and yarrow mix (to stop bleeding), herbal tinc- tures such as Oregon grape and echinacea • A list of items in the kit and brief descriptions of how they are used First aid kits for animals are avail- able through many catalogs, and you can add your own items to per- sonalize the one you choose. A cat- alog company called PetSage car- ries several nice ones, including one for birds. Herbs for Pets 250 bandages, tweezers, cotton swabs, a bulb syringe, and a variety of herbal medicines), we also carry a homeopathic travel kit with us wherever we go. Homeopathic remedies are compact, convenient, effective, and especially use- ful for emergency situations. It’s also important to learn canine and feline car- diopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and the ABCs of basic first aid. Regardless of how extensive your first aid kit or class- room training might be, everything you compile is functionally useless if you are unable to react properly in a crisis situa- tion. The most crucial aspects of emer- gency preparedness are proactive study and mental conditioning. An emergency situation is a poor time to read up on what to do or give. During a crisis, time is of the essence, especially if your com- panion is bleeding severely or having a difficult time breathing. When placed under the stress of an emotional, adrena- line-pumped situation (such as after you watch your cat get hit by a careless motorist), the human mind loses much of its ability to formulate an effective plan of action—the mind begins to race, the knees start to shake, dizziness sets in, and it’s difficult to think. Instead of thinking the situation through, the brain must react by instinct. If there is no plan imbedded deep in the mind’s subcon- scious, panic sets in and all control of the situation is lost to a rampant avalanche of emotion and confusion. Panic is our worst enemy in an emer- gency situation because the confusion it causes paralyzes our abilities to take effective actions. It’s best to prepare for stressful emergency situations before they occur. This is done by visualizing cri- sis situations so that the mind is better prepared to respond intuitively and effec- tively when a real emergency occurs. For instance, if you are an avid backcountry equestrian, spend some time each week with your eyes closed, imagining various emergency situations that could occur to you and your companion on your upcoming trail trips. Be creative but real- istic in your visualization of each unfortu- nate event—imagine the fall, your com- ECHINACEA AND OREGON GRAPE CLAY POULTICE Combine the following: 4 oz green or bentonite clay (powder)* 1⁄2 oz echinacea tincture (alcohol based) 1⁄2 oz Oregon grape tincture (alcohol based) *Be sure to use only supplement- grade clay (available at health food stores) Bentonite clay that is sold at hard- ware and feed stores often contains harmful bacteria and other impuri- ties. Alcohol-based tinctures (as opposed to glycerin-based) are preferable because they add astrin- gency to the formula and serve as preservatives in a poultice that is saved for future use. Thoroughly combine the three ingredients, adding just enough distilled water to make a thick paste. The poultice can then be applied to the affected areas and left on to dry, if possible. Leftover poultice can be put into an airtight container and stored in the refrigerator almost indefinitely. If it dries out, just add more water or tincture to soften it. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 251 panion’s pain and terror, your racing heart, and the initial surge of panic and doubt that starts to envelop you. Then imagine overcoming that surge and tak- ing control of your emotions to assess the situation. Imagine opening your first aid kit and systematically selecting the items your companion needs as you calm him down by softly petting him and assuring him that you are in charge of the situa- tion. Imagine yourself remedying the sit- uation and knowing that everything will be fine. When we worked in emergency serv- ices, we called this exercise “crisis rehearsal”—others call it “creative visual- ization.” To some of you, this may sound like a program for paranoia, but it is quite the opposite. Paranoia is born from fear and a conscious sense of being helpless and out of control. Crisis rehearsal builds confidence and subconsciously prepares the mind for unforeseeable events. Each time you practice this technique, your subconscious mind stores experiential memories from which to act in emergen- cies. In other words, you don’t need to think, worry, or be paranoid of unfore- seeable possibilities each time you take your companion on an adventure— instead, you have the elements of effec- tive crisis management stored beneath the enjoyment of your adventure, where instinct can retrieve and use them if the need arises. This is an extremely effective technique for preparing for the worst. It has saved our lives and the lives of others more than a few times. Crisis rehearsal can make the difference between life and death for you and your companion. BITES AND STINGS If your companion receives a bite or a sting, the first course of action is to try to identify what launched the attack. Of course, this is not always possible, but if you can learn about the nature of the bite or sting, you will be more effective at treating it. In most cases, the primary course of action is to minimize pain, swelling, and the possibility of infection with the use of astringent and antimicro- bial herbs. A poultice or infusion of plan- tain, sage, bee balm, mullein, calendula, or chamomile can be directly applied to the site of an insect bite or sting for these purposes. To make a poultice, simply mash a few fresh leaves of the herb with a small amount of water to make a crude pestolike paste. In the field, the herb can be crushed and chewed in your mouth, then applied as a paste to the wound. Oregon grape, goldenseal, myrrh, thyme, or echinacea tincture, oil infusion, or salve FIRST AID OIL FOR CONTUSIONS AND BLUNT TRAUMA INJURIES Combine equal parts of the follow- ing oil infusions*: Yarrow Comfrey Saint-John’s-wort *See “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1 for instructions on how to make an oil infusion. Apply this first aid oil immediately to blunt injuries where subdermal bleeding is evident. After a day or two when the bleeding has stopped and the healing process has begun, arnica oil can be applied sparingly to the injury site for up to three days (any longer might irritate the skin). This will help move congested fluids out of the injured area by opening up capillaries. Herbs for Pets 252 can be applied to the area if stronger antimicrobial agents are warranted. One or all of these herbal preparations are excellent choices for building a first aid kit. An infusion of rosemary can be used for a bite or sting to gently bathe and soothe the surrounding area. Adding 6–8 drops of tea tree oil diluted in 1 ounce of water is also good for direct application to bites and stings, but be careful with animals who have sensitive skin—the oil is strong. For severe welts and inflammation, strong astringents such as decoctions of uva ursi, rose bark, white oak bark, or juniper leaves can be liberally applied to affected areas. A clay poultice made with bentonite clay is also effective, especially when herbs such as echinacea and Oregon grape are added to support lym- phatic functions and inhibit infection. When applied to the site of a sting or bite, the clay pulls antigens away from the body to reduce swelling and help prevent capillary transport of venom into other areas. Bites from toxic spiders, such as the brown recluse or black widow, or ven- omous snakes should be immediately fol- lowed with large doses of vitamin C and echinacea to build the body’s immune defenses and increase lymphatic cleans- ing of involved tissues. Immediate administration of the appropriate home- opathic remedy is also highly advisable. In the case of a bee or wasp sting, the homeopathic remedies Apis and Ledum help relieve stinging and swelling. If there is an anaphylactic reaction, or if the airway is compromised in any way, get to a veterinarian immediately. If you already know that your companion is predis- posed to acute allergic reactions, you should be carrying a prescription injectable epinephrine and antihistamine kit (Anakit or Epipen) that helps to anti- dote your animal’s reaction to insect or reptile venoms. See your veterinarian about obtaining a kit. BRUISES, BUMPS, AND OTHER BLUNT TRAUMAS Contusions (bruises) are caused when blunt impact or crushing pressure causes tissue damage and bleeding beneath the skin. In humans, contusions are usually characterized by their purplish red color. Because animals have different skin pigments and hair, feathers, fur, or scales to hide such evidence of injury, contu- sions and other forms of traumatic, sub- dermal hematoma must be identified by other symptoms. Usually there is swelling and tenderness at the site of a contusion. The animal may favor or lick the injured body area. Close examination (beneath the animal’s coat) usually reveals discol- oration at the site. Since contusions are contained beneath the skin, the risk of infection is low (provided the animal is healthy to begin with). First aid usually begins with applying an ice pack to slow bleeding and assist the coagulation process. Contrary to what some herbalists may think, arnica oil or salve is sometimes contraindicated in the early treatment of contusions or subdermal hematoma. Arnica, a peripheral vasodilator that works rapidly, may actually increase bleeding at the site of injury. Instead of reaching for your handy first aid vial of arnica oil, reach for an oil infusion of yarrow. Yarrow is remarkable because it acts as a vasodilator when ingested but as a fast-acting vasoconstrictor and hemostatic agent when applied topically. This makes it very useful for reducing the severity of fresh contusions, especially when combined with an oil infusion of Saint-John’s-wort. Having a special affini- ty toward the repair of crushed nerve endings, Saint-John’s-wort helps to relieve pain and minimize the possibility An Herbal Repertory for Animals 253 of lasting nerve impairment. Comfrey oil, salve, and poultice are also excellent first aid devices for blunt trauma injuries because they gently assist with lymph cir- culation without contributing to internal bleeding, and they accelerate the regen- eration of damaged cell structures. BURNS AND SCALDS There are two important considerations to keep in mind when your companion suffers a burn. One is that until the site of the injury cools down, cellular damage can continue for several minutes after a burn first occurs. This is especially true if the burn was caused by steam or scald- ing fluid, which can penetrate tissues and carry injurious heat deep beneath the skin. Another consideration to keep in mind is that when the skin is damaged, its ability to resist infection is greatly impaired. To defend itself against invad- ing bacteria, the skin relies upon delicate cell membranes and thousands of tiny capillaries to carry lymph, blood, and var- ious antibodies throughout its structure. When a burn occurs, circulation is obstructed within the site of injury, and the deprived tissues are left vulnerable to infection. The first course in treating a burn is to cool it down. Ideally, the site of the burn should be liberally irrigated with cool sterile saline, which greatly reduces the continued destruction of cells. If sterile saline is not available, clean water (preferably distilled), snow, or ice can be generously applied—just keep in mind that the area you are irrigating is espe- cially susceptible to any infectious microbes that may be in the water (i.e., the cleaner it is, the better). Never apply a salve, oil, or ointment to a burn—these types of preparations can seal in heat and bacteria, making the situation worse. Don’t cover the burned area with a band- age either unless you will be able to keep the dressing continually soaked with cool, clean water. If the burn appears to be deep (sec- ond or third degree) or if it involves the mouth, nose, feet, or a large percentage of the animal’s body, get the animal to a veterinarian immediately—the situation might be serious. The second course of action (for minor burns) is to take continuing meas- ures to assure that the burn is kept clean. Irrigate the burn several times each day with sterile saline. Aloe juice can be directly applied to the burn after each irrigation to help fight infection, reduce pain, and speed the healing process. A cooled tea of chaparral, calendula, or gotu kola can be effective for these pur- poses as well, as might a poultice of fresh chickweed. Comfrey is useful too, but it should not be applied until you are absolutely sure that the risk of infection has passed. Comfrey heals wounds so fast that it can seal bacteria or fungi into the wound! A skin rinse of chamomile, peppermint, catnip, bee balm, or thyme may bring relief from pain. Lavender oil (8 drops diluted into each ounce of clean water) is also good for relieving the pain of burns and scalds. The homeopathic remedies Apis and Urtica spp. (nettle) are effective treat- ments for burns. We keep a bottle of diluted Urtica tincture in our kitchen for use on burns. It takes the sting away immediately and prevents blistering. It can also be given internally. To help the healing process from inside out, dietary supplements of vita- mins C and E are important, as are fatty acids. Gotu kola can be added to an ani- mal’s diet to help with skin regeneration, as can horsetail. FRACTURES Obviously, herbs cannot be expected to realign and set a broken bone, but a Herbs for Pets 254 variety of herbs are useful throughout the postclinical healing process. Horsetail, nettle, comfrey, and alfalfa all contain nutritional components that play impor- tant roles in the healing of bone tissue. Yarrow and ginkgo help by increasing blood circulation in impaired extremities. Licorice, yucca, devil’s claw, Saint-John’s- wort, and cayenne are all useful for reducing inflammation and pain. Valerian, skullcap, passionflower, or hop can be used to help a recovering animal rest and relax. HEATSTROKE, HYPERTHERMIA, AND HEAT EXHAUSTION Heatstroke or heat exhaustion can occur as a result of too much strenuous exer- cise or excessive exposure to heat. If heatstroke is not treated immediately the animal’s body temperature may rise to irreversible levels and brain damage, kidney failure, or death may quickly fol- low. Symptoms of heat illness include excessive panting or difficulty breath- ing, high body temperature (above 104° F for a dog or cat), lethargy or col- lapse, loss of appetite, bloody diarrhea or vomit, increased heart rate, increased respiratory rate, reddened tongue or eye tissues, hot and flushed skin, and seizures or coma. Perhaps the most common cause of heat-related illness and death in dogs and cats occurs when they are left in cars on a warm or hot day. Don’t ever leave your companion in the car unless the weather is mild, there is ample shade to park under, the windows can be left rolled down, and the animal is left with plenty of drinking water. Even on days that don’t seem hot, the temperature in a well-ventilated vehicle can exceed 100° F in a matter of minutes. With the win- dows rolled up, the temperature can climb to 180° F (a steak cooks at 140° F)! Dogs and cats need to pant and get fresh air to cool themselves. If you find an ani- mal in a car that is closed up, try to con- tact the owner and offer to give a bowl of water to his or her companion who “looks thirsty.” If done in a nonthreaten- ing way, without offending the person, you could save an animal’s life. If the per- son insists on letting the animal suffer, call the local law enforcement agency. If your companion displays signs of heat-related illness, get to a cool area immediately, wet the animal with water, and if possible, take the animal’s rectal temperature. If the animal’s temperature seems abnormally high, get to a vet immediately. If you are carrying a home- opathic kit with you, you might try administering a dose of Glonoinum (30C) while en route. Rescue Remedy (a flower essence formula) might be helpful as well. Allow your animal to drink as much cool water as he needs. After the danger has passed and your companion appears to be recovering, you can begin replacing lost minerals ALL-PURPOSE FIRST AID OIL OR SALVE Saint-John’s-wort oil infusion Oregon Grape oil infusion Comfrey oil infusion 1 oz grated beeswax Combine equal amounts of the oil infusions.

MOTION SICKNESS Motion sickness is fairly common among dogs and cats, especially puppies and those who seldom take rides in cars. The causes of motion sickness are varied. The inner ears of puppies and other young animals continue to develop until the animals approach adolescence, which means that their equilibrium may be especially sensitive to motion. Another factor comes into play in animals who are frightened or become hyperactive during car rides. In these animals, extreme nerv- ousness may cause stomach upset, dizzi- ness, or hyperventilation, all of which can result in vomiting. In most cases, motion sickness becomes less of a problem as an animal matures or becomes accustomed to the feeling of hurtling through space in a “crate on wheels.” Have you ever thought about how an animal might perceive such an unnatural occurrence as a car ride? With this in mind, it’s important to help your companion to consider car rides to be fun as early in life as possible. Make a point to play with your companion at the destina- tions of her first couple dozen car trips to replace confusion and fear with anticipation of a good time. For many animals, this approach is effective. We dearly remember riding to our moun- tain cabin with our dog Mollie on week- ends. The winding highway and steep ravines often made her nervous and carsick, so each time we reached the most challenging part of the highway, we would begin saying to her, “Get your Frisbee! Get your stick! Do you want to go swimming? Find the cat (her beloved friend and playmate)!” After a few verses of this, her mind would be so focused on the playtime that would soon follow that she would forget about the frightening ride and car sick- ness wasn’t a problem. Eventually, her nervousness during car rides was com- pletely replaced by the thrill of another adventure. Of course, some animals may never get over motion sickness, and anything that might help is certainly appreciated, espe- cially if you’re sharing a subcompact sedan with a Newfoundland. Ginger, pep- permint, catnip, fennel, or dill might help relieve an upset stomach that might lead to vomiting. Ginkgo is known to improve blood circulation in the inner ear and may help with equilibrium problems. Valerian helps calm a hyperactive animal and also eases a nervous stomach. Skullcap, pas- sionflower, and oatstraw are all excellent nervine-sedatives that can help reduce nervous anxiety. Of course, before you try any of these (in combination or singular- ly), give Rescue Remedy (flower essences) a try. A few drops on your animal’s tongue just before you get into the car might make the difference between an unpleas- ant episode and a fun car ride. PENETRATING INJURIES (CUTS, SCRAPES, PUNCTURES) Penetrating injuries are part of life, espe- cially if you have an active outdoor ani- mal. Animals tolerate wounds much bet- ter than we humans do, and provided animals have healthy lymph and immune systems and no blood-clotting disorders, minor open injuries usually heal quickly and completely. The primary concern here is that the injury is kept clean and as well ventilated as cleanliness allows. From a holistic perspective, an animal licking his open wound is a natural part of the healing process. This is how ani- mals cleanse wounds, and, in fact, the saliva of dogs and cats contain antimicro- bial properties that help fight infection and speed healing. Herbs for Pets 256 At the onset of a penetrating injury, the first course of action is to make sure that the bleeding is in no way life threat- ening. If bleeding is profuse, nothing serves as a better hemostatic agent than a half-and-half mix of powdered cayenne and yarrow. When applied liberally and directly into a wound, these two herbs work amazingly well to stop hemorrhage and inhibit infection. After the powder is applied, gauze compresses can then be placed on top to assist the process and keep the injury clean. Treat for shock, and get your companion to a veterinari- an immediately. If the wound does not appear to be life threatening, allow it to flush and seal itself, and thoroughly clean the site with fresh water (use sterile saline if possible) or some hydrogen peroxide as soon as possible. Oregon grape, goldenseal, Saint-John’s-wort, thyme, sage, echi- nacea, or yarrow tea or liniment can be used to irrigate the wound each day to help prevent infection. Tea tree oil is effective too, but it must be diluted. Add 8 drops into 1 ounce of olive, almond, or apricot kernel oil. Calendula, comfrey, gotu kola, or aloe can be added to the daily regimen after risk of infection has passed to help speed the healing process and reduce scarring. Any or all of the herbs we just mentioned can be used in the form of a first aid salve that is applied between each daily cleansing. The salve is also useful for field treatment of minor wounds. POISONING A shocking number of companion ani- mals die each year of poisoning. Some cases involve cruel human intent, others an unfortunate discovery or accident. But most companion animal poisonings are the direct result of carelessness. Improperly stored or disposed of auto- motive antifreeze fluid represents one of the most frequent causes of accidental animal poisoning. Ethylene glycol, the compound found in antifreeze, has a sweet flavor that is appealing to dogs, cats, and other animals. It destroys the kidneys, and as little as 1 tablespoon can be fatal to a medium or large dog. Lead poisoning from old house paint, discarded batteries, spilled petroleum products, or industrial waste is also a common cause of companion animal poisoning. Pesticides, herbicides, and household cleaning chemicals are famil- iar toxins as well. The mechanisms by which poisons act against the body are as varied as their chemistries. Lead-based poisons cause brain damage, while pesticides, herbi- cides, and household chemicals may cause nervous system damage, liver and kidney damage, internal bleeding, hypoxic blood disorders, or even cancer. Certain plants may cause poisoning too, although animals are less likely to ingest them, and their effects are mostly limited to digestive upset, photosensitive reac- tions, rashes, and in a few cases, internal bleeding. Food poisoning is usually limit- ed to the digestive tract and is generally corrected by vomiting. The chemical structure of a poison and the way it behaves in the body dic- tates the manner in which an animal is treated. In some cases, vomiting is induced to expel the poison from the body as quickly as possible. But in other instances, such as ingestion of petroleum products or acids, vomiting may further compound the problem by allowing poi- son to enter the lungs or burn the esoph- agus on the way out. This makes a gen- eral approach to poisoning impossible and illustrates why it’s critically important to identify the source of poisoning as quickly as possible. To prepare for the unforeseeable, keep some activated charcoal on hand. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 257 This is fed to a poisoned animal under the direction of a veterinarian to help absorb many forms of poison as the ani- mal is rushed to the veterinary hospital. If a poisoning does happen, don’t waste time with home treatment—get your companion to a veterinarian imme- diately! If two or more humans are pres- ent, one should transport the animal, while the other(s) should confirm the identity of the suspected poison and relay that information to the waiting veterinarian. Although many types of herbs such as violet root, elderberry, and aloe can be used to induce vomiting in certain cases of poisoning, this action is not recom- mended unless you know the exact nature of the poison and the proper course of action. Guessing can be fatal. Therefore, herbs are best reserved to sup- port and help rejuvenate an animal’s body after the crisis has passed. To help repair the liver after a poison- ing, milk thistle is strongly indicated. If the liver is inflamed, licorice may be of bene- fit. Mild cholagogue, alterative, and diuretic herbs, such as dandelion (root and leaf), burdock, alfalfa, and red clover, assist the body in efforts to eliminate resid- ual toxins and their metabolic by-prod- ucts. Yellow dock is believed to help remove heavy metals from the body. Immunostimulant and antioxidant herbs such as echinacea and garlic give the immune system a needed boost, while adaptogens such as astragalus or Siberian ginseng can help improve the body’s overall responses to the added stress. If kidney damage is evident, marshmallow, corn silk, ginkgo, hawthorn, horsetail, and couch grass are all candidates for use. If you wish to learn more about poi- sonings or need help during an emer- gency, call the Animal Poison Control Center at 1-888-426-4435. A consulta- tion fee of $60 applies. SHOCK Shock occurs when the vascular system is unable to provide adequate blood supply to vital organs. Hemorrhagic shock is caused when blood pressure and volume are reduced as a result of internal or external bleeding. Cardiogenic shock occurs when heart disease or dysfunction causes a reduction of blood delivery to other organs. Septic shock is caused when bacteria invade the heart muscle, other organs, or the blood itself and cause enough injury to cells to interfere with their ability to utilize oxygen. All types of shock create a situation in which various body tissues are deprived of oxy- gen that would normally be provided by the blood. Shock is therefore a life-threat- ening situation that demands immediate and decisive first aid attention. Get to a vet! You must stop bleeding and take measures to increase blood volume immediately. If the animal’s breathing is labored, try to position his body in a way that appears to make breathing easier. If possible, try to keep the lower half of the animal’s body slightly higher than the heart and head—this helps to keep blood volume at the brain, heart, and lungs. While en route to the veterinarian, Rescue Remedy can be applied to the ears, paws, or lips of a conscious or unconscious animal. TTouch, acupres- sure, and homeopathic remedies (Aconite and Arnica) may also prove helpful. If you’ve been trained, be pre- pared to perform CPR in the event of car- diac arrest. After a shock crisis is over, cardiopul- monary function can be assisted with the use of cardiovascular tonics. Hawthorn and ginkgo can be fed to strengthen the heart and increase blood circulation throughout the body. Yarrow or cayenne can be used to increase blood circulation and oxygenation in the lungs. Nettle, spirulina, and alfalfa are good nutritives Herbs for Pets 258 for building healthy blood. Garlic feeds the blood and also has antioxidant, vas- cular tonic, and immunotonic qualities. TENDONITIS, SPRAINS, AND LIGAMENT INJURIES Injuries of fibrous tissues that connect muscle with bone can be extremely painful and slow to heal. Generally speak- ing, the sooner herbal therapy starts, the faster the animal’s recovery will be. Arnica oil, salve, or poultice should be applied immediately after the injury occurs—this begins the healing process by increasing capillary circulation and lymphatic infusion. However, Arnica should not be used on open wounds. If Arnica is not available, yarrow, cayenne, or Saint-John’s-wort may prove benefi- cial, as will a poultice compress of com- frey. Homeopathic Arnica, Ledum, Rhus toxicodendron, or Ruta (depending on symptoms) may be effective first aid treatments as well. To continue the healing process, the animal’s diet can be supplemented with vitamin C and glucosamine sulfate or chondroitin sulfate. These supplements play positive roles in the reconstruction of connective tissues. Feeding your com- panion animal horsetail and comfrey can also aid in the reconstructive process. To help minimize pain and inflammation, yucca, licorice, willow bark (but not for cats), devil’s claw, and boswellia are all choices to consider. Yarrow and ginkgo can be fed to maintain good blood circu- lation in the affected extremity. Immune System Care To recognize and treat immune system disorders effectively, it’s important to have a general understanding of what the immune system is and how it works. The immune system is composed of a complex assortment of various cells and molecules, all of which are joined in an interdependent effort to maintain a bal- anced state of health. Each and every organ, tissue, and cell of the body has an integral role in this effort—the liver and kidneys, for instance, are responsible for filtering toxins and waste from the blood, and the skin serves as a first line of defense against pathogenic microbes and other environmental threats. Working beneath or within the structures and functions of the various organs and tissues of the body is a sophisticated army of frontline defenders—the millions of special cells, molecules, and microbes we know specifically as the immune sys- tem. Each member of this elite army has a special function—some members serve as sentries and detectives with the sole purpose of seeking out and identifying harmful invaders or waste products, while others serve as responding attack- ers to kill and remove invading microbes and other foreign substances. Like any army, the immune system must quickly reach each battlefield, or site of infection, to be effective. To allow a rapid response, the blood and lymphat- ic system serve as the army’s transport and incursion system. The blood carries antibodies (specialized proteins that serve to detect and report any foreign presence to the army’s soldiers), lympho- cytes and monocytes (the first-response assault teams), and interleukins and vari- ous other cytokines (messenger mole- cules that provide communication between other elements of the army), as well as oxygen and nutrients that are necessary to feed tissues and wage a bat- tle wherever the immune army is need- ed. To clean up the aftermath of battle, the spleen filters the blood and serves as a fatal trap for foreign bodies that were not killed by the body’s warriors. The lymphatic system’s purpose is to cleanse and nourish cells and tissues and to carry the immune effort across barriers An Herbal Repertory for Animals 259 that cannot be effectively reached by the blood. Lymphocytes are produced in the bone marrow, thymus (hence the “T” in killer T cells), and throughout the body in various mucosal-associated lymphoid tissues. The lymph (a clear, viscous fluid) then carries these warriors via an intri- cate network of tiny vessels on an end- less journey in and out of the blood- stream and the body’s various tissues. As the lymphocytes seek and destroy for- eign invaders, the lymph picks up their dead bodies and other debris. The waste is then filtered out and surviving invaders are destroyed at lymph nodes that are strategically positioned throughout the body. Autoimmune disease or dysfunction occurs when one or more elements of the immune system becomes deficient, overwhelmed, or overactive. Holistic treatment of autoimmune diseases (such as lupus, arthritis, FIV, allergies, to name a few) centers on assisting the body in its innate ability to establish and maintain balance and preparedness within the immune system. The use of vaccines, antibiotics, and steroid drugs is contra- dictory to the holistic healing effort because these substances are antagonis- tic to the body’s natural defense mecha- nisms. Such measures work by suppress- ing, confusing, or bypassing natural immune functions, which amounts to an artificially induced state of autoimmune deficiency. Barring genetic predisposition, ani- mals who are consistently well nourished and properly cared for have strong immune systems throughout their long, healthy lives. On the other hand, animals who are subjected to immunosuppres- sive drug therapies eventually develop some form of immune dysfunction—per- haps arthritis, chronic seborrhea, aller- gies, or diminished resistance to certain strains of bacteria, fungi, or parasites. Whether or not to vaccinate your companion involves heated arguments among animal care professionals on both sides of the issue, as well as political, social, economic, and legal interests. At the root of all the confusion lies a press- ing question: Should well-informed ani- mal guardians be allowed to decide what is best for their beloved companion ani- mals? We, of course, believe that owners should have that right. Although we can- not advise anyone to break the law in areas where vaccinations are deemed mandatory, we are holistically opposed to vaccinating animals. HERBS FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM SUPPORT Many of the diseases and problems dis- cussed in this book are related to the immune system. A few diseases or syn- dromes are recognized as being directly related to immunity and might be con- sidered autoimmune diseases. When Stimulating the immune system with echinacea may be counter-productive to the healing process. Herbs for Pets 260 most herb users think of immune system support, immunostimulant standbys such as echinacea immediately come to mind. For many immune-related disor- ders, however, increased stimulation of immune system functions represents only a small part of a complete herbal therapy, and in some cases, stimulation of immune activities may actually be coun- terproductive in the healing effort. A good case in point is discoid lupus ery- thematosus (DLE), a disease that occurs primarily in dogs and less commonly in cats. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic inflammatory condition of the skin (primarily that of the nose, lips, cheeks, and ears) that occurs as the result of a failure in the regulating mechanisms of the immune system, specifically those that prevent the body from attacking its own cells. In other words, the immune army works against the body it is sup- posed to protect. Animals with DLE typi- cally suffer from pyoderma, seborrhea, and other chronic conditions of the skin, as well as arthritis, kidney problems, and other immune-mediated forms of dis- ease. For obvious reasons, it would be inadvisable to further stimulate the immune system with herbs such as echi- nacea. On the other hand, many herbs can act as immune moderators, meaning that they help adjust the immune system into balance. Such herbs include astra- galus, shiitake and reishi mushrooms, garlic, and ginseng. The immune system and its variable problems are complex, and no single herb serves as a panacea for immune sys- tem dysfunction. Because a great deal of sensationalism has been placed on herbs that have been shown to stimulate immune system functions, many people have been led to believe that an herb such as echinacea is always the first thing to reach for to fight any problem that involves the immune system. Entre- preneurs have made such claims a multi- million dollar affair, but the claims simply aren’t true. Contrary to what many herb product manufacturers might lead you to believe, immune system support does not begin with stimulation. In fact, stimulation should be limited to activating a healthy immune system in times when increased immune response is necessary to repel viral, bacterial, or fungal infection. In some cases of immune-mediated disease, immunostimulants may ultimately do more harm than good. For instance, echinacea and Saint-John’s-wort are capable of stimulating reproduction of killer T cells, the search-and-destroy sol- diers whose numbers are severely dimin- ished in people or animals with AIDS. On the surface of the problem, stimulation of T cells may sound like a good idea, but by stimulating their reproduction, we may also be aggravating and accelerat- ing the mechanisms that are causing their destruction. Therefore, the best course of action in immune-mediated problems is to support the body in its efforts to reestablish and maintain healthy balance among all aspects of nat- ural immunity. If stimulating the immune system is indicated, several herbs are available that have immunostimulant qualities. Some herbs, such as echinacea, have strong and specific immune-stimulating activi- ties, making them especially useful when the immune system needs a quick boost. Others, such as garlic, Siberian ginseng, astragalus, licorice, shiitake and reishi mushrooms, and turmeric, offer im- mune-supportive qualities in addition to a wide spectrum of tonic activities. For instance, astragalus, shiitake and reishi mushrooms, and Siberian ginseng are all adaptogens, meaning that they help increase energy levels and improve the body’s ability to respond to stressful situ- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 261 ations (such as systemic disease, infec- tion, or emotional trauma). Garlic offers strong antimicrobial, antioxidant, and hypotensive activities in addition to being an immunostimulant device. Turmeric stimulates liver and digestive functions as part of its immune-boosting agenda. Licorice and borage stimulate the adrenal glands and support and pro- tect the liver, making them useful in treating Addison’s disease (hypoadreno- corticism) or problems that stem from steroid drug use or excessive X-ray exposure. In summary, before you pick up echi- nacea for immune system support, edu- cate yourself. Find out more about your companion animal’s condition and read up on echinacea and other herbs men- tioned in this book as well as other immune-supportive herbs. You will likely find an herb that is specifically suited to your companion’s needs. ALLERGIES Allergies occur when antigenic sub- stances (allergens) enter the body and trigger a disproportionately aggressive immune response. Conventional treat- ment usually involves the use of antihista- mine and corticosteroid drugs. These drugs suppress immune system functions so that the uncomfortable symptoms of allergy cannot occur. This action allevi- ates the symptoms for a while but leaves their actual causes unaddressed. In fact, such drugs may compound the underly- ing immune system dysfunction that is causing the problem in the first place. Allergies are a symptom of an immune system disorder that may be related to a nutritional deficiency or excess, steroid or antibiotic therapies, vaccinosis, or metabolic dysfunction. Therefore, the questions to ask in the holistic treatment of allergies are three- fold: (1) What substance is causing an immune response, (2) Why is the immune system responding so dispro- portionately to the substance, and (3) What can be done to help correct this response? Holistic treatment is focused on mod- erating immune responses and improv- ing the body’s ability to process and elim- inate potential allergens. The effort begins with an intensive assessment of the animal’s diet, environment, and health care history. As causative factors are identified and dealt with, herbal ther- apy begins with tonic support of liver, digestive, lymphatic, and urinary func- tions that are responsible for filtering and eliminating problematic substances from the body. This in turn supports and improves immune activities by helping to remove antigenic substances and meta- bolic waste products that might be com- pounding the problem. At the core of this approach are alterative, diuretic, and cholagogue herbs. Burdock, red clover, dandelion root, spirulina, and alfalfa are all worthy candidates for improving liver efficiency and building strong, healthy blood. The oils or stabilized powders of flaxseed, borage seed, black currant seed, and evening primrose seed contain EFAs that play important roles in immune system development and health. Dandelion leaf serves especially well as an effective diuretic agent to aid in the elimination of waste products that are carried out of the body via the urine. Nettle is an excellent tonic for animals who suffer from seasonal allergies, as it lends mild antihistamine relief in addi- tion to strong diuretic and blood-nour- ishing qualities. The Basic Support Formula under “Skin Problems” is useful for all of these purposes. Uncomfortable symptoms of allergy can be approached according to the sys- tems involved. In severe cases in which identification of causative factors proves Herbs for Pets 262 to be a lengthy process, licorice can be used as a less-obtrusive alternative to steroid drugs. The Systemic Detoxifying Formula under “Skin Problems” may be effective. It’s important to remember, however, that symptomatic suppression does not amount to a cure. Don’t be fooled into action by the joy of seeing your companion feel better—keep look- ing for answers until a long-term holistic solution is found. Because an allergy equates to an over- active immune system, immunostimulant herbs (such as echinacea) may be con- traindicated. Adaptogenic herbs, those herbs that improve or support the body’s response to stressful circumstances such as Siberian ginseng or astragalus may be helpful in re-establishing and maintain- ing immune system balances in animals who suffer allergies. Mouth and Nose Problems MOUTH PROBLEMS Some animals have problems with their teeth and gums throughout their lives. Others seem to be lucky or in such good health that their gums and teeth remain healthy for life. A healthy, natural, raw food diet is paramount to healthy gums and teeth. For dogs and cats, this means raw, meaty bones and a diversity of enzyme- and nutrient-rich fresh vegeta- bles. Many herbivores have needs that go beyond simple dietary cleansing and nutrition—their teeth need to be contin- uously worn down by the foods they eat to prevent the teeth from becoming too long and to remove weak and decaying outer layers of enamel. Fresh, whole, fibrous vegetables and grains are an absolute necessity for this process. Most mouth problems are easily taken care of at home with a few simple herbal preparations. But if your animal is having difficulty chewing and eating or is paw- ing at his mouth, he may have a minor tooth or gum infection that can progress into a serious condition if not addressed. In cases of gingivitis, bacteria can eventu- ANTIMICROBIAL NOSE DROPS Calendula tincture * Oregon grape tincture * Usnea lichen tincture * 2 oz sterile saline Combine 10 drops of each of the alcohol tinctures with the sterile saline. *Tinctures are available through most herb retailers To use for sinusitis, drop or spray the above solution into each nostril, preferably with the animal’s head tilted slightly skyward. Expect resist- ance and sneezing during adminis- tration—your companion probably won’t like this. Adverse reactions are rare with this formula, but before administering a full dose, check for hypersensitivity by placing a small drop onto the rim of one nostril. If your companion starts sneezing and doesn’t stop within a few minutes, he may be sensitive to one or more of these herbs or the alcohol, so don’t use the drops. A drop or two per nostril twice daily is a sufficient dose for cats and similar-sized animals. Dogs need 4–6 drops per nostril (or a short squirt of the sprayer). Horses and other large animals require 10–20 drops per nostril. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 263 ally infect the kidneys, causing irre- versible damage to these vital organs. If your herbal efforts fail to remedy your companion’s bad breath or oral discom- fort or if the animal’s gums are severely inflamed, bleeding, or discharging pus, get to a veterinarian immediately. A red gum line (along the base of an animal’s teeth) may also be indicative of a serious underlying problem that demands pro- fessional attention. Gingivitis and Infections of the Mouth Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums that is usually caused by bacterial infec- tion. Symptoms may include bad breath; reddened, swollen, and sometimes ulcer- ated gums; and pain and difficulty while eating. Gingivitis rarely occurs in healthy animals who receive a balanced, raw food diet. It’s therefore important to make sure your companion receives the vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and probi- otics he needs to maintain a strong immune system and good oral health. For dogs and cats, nothing compares with raw, meaty bones for maintaining healthy teeth and gums. Other causes of oral infection include puncture wounds from fights or ram- bunctious play (puppy and kitten teeth make for dangerous jaw wrestling), abra- sions or lacerations from chewing on nonfood items, wood splinters, and den- tal cavities. Dietary supplementation of CoQ10, vitamin C, and a variety of antimicrobial herbs may prove useful for reducing infection and activating the healing process in the mouth. Echinacea provides a needed boost to the immune system. To inhibit bacteria or fungi directly, a tincture of certified organic goldenseal, Oregon grape, thyme, sage, rosemary, or better yet, myrrh, can be liberally applied directly to the animal’s gums (or any other site of oral infection) with a cotton swab. If the animal is less than coopera- tive, a turkey-basting syringe can be used to rinse the animal’s mouth—put 20 drops of tincture in 2 ounces of water or give 2 ounces of tea for each 20 pounds of the animal’s weight, two to three times daily. To freshen bad breath, pars- ley leaf can be fed as a tincture, as a cooled tea, or in its whole form. If bad breath is not a problem, dietary supple- mentation of garlic can also be helpful. Propolis is also excellent for infected gums or mouth ulcers. NOSE AND SINUS PROBLEMS Nose and sinus problems are usually due to environmental influences such as bites, stings, allergens, microbial infec- tion, or litter box dust (a major cause of sinus problems in cats). Provided the problem is isolated to the nose and nasal passages and is related to foreign sub- stances, not a tumor or other metabolic disorder, nose and sinus problems can be treated effectively with simple herbal preparations. If the problem is secondary to other disorders, the therapeutic approach varies according to the nature of onset. For instance, sinusitis secondary to seasonal allergies is best approached with dietary adjustment and herbs that Swab antimicrobial herbal tinctures directly on your dog’s gums to treat oral infections. Herbs for Pets 264 support the various systems involved. Inflammation secondary to an insect sting requires topical (astringent) appli- cations to help relieve uncomfortable symptoms and immunotonic and lym- phatic herbs such as echinacea and cal- endula to support the metabolic process- es of removing foreign substances from involved tissues. Sometimes, abnormal nasal dis- charge, inflammation, sneezing, or other symptoms may be difficult to link to a cause. In these cases, the diagnostic capabilities and holistic insights of an experienced veterinarian should not be overlooked. If a problem is found to stem from deeper health issues, holistic treatment must begin at those issues and not with the nasal symptoms. This is important: Don’t assume anything. Identify the cause of disease before beginning any herbal treatment. If you don’t, you may be neglecting your com- panion’s real needs. For bacterial or fungal infections of the nostrils, sinuses, or outer tissues of the nose, a saline-based preparation of calendula, Oregon grape, and usnea lichen can be effective against a broad spectrum of bacteria and fungi. Externally, this preparation can be liberal- ly applied to all affected areas. For infec- tions inside the nose and sinuses, it can be administered with a dropper or as a nasal spray (empty bottles for nasal spray are available from pharmacies). Parasite-Related Problems: How to Live with Fleas,Worms, Mites, and Other Things That Suck If you’re like most people who share their homes with companion animals, there’s a good chance that this is the first part of the book you’ve turned to. Parasites are the most common source of torment and frustration shared by animals and their human guardians. From an animal’s per- spective, fleas, mites, and other blood- sucking freeloaders are often the causes of sustained torture and misery. To an animal guardian, parasites are evil, dis- gusting, and invasive. Creatures that latch onto flesh and suck the life fluids from their hosts have earned top billing in our nightmares. Unfortunately, while we struggle with our hate for such creatures by engaging in a relentless and futile battle to wipe parasites from the face of the planet, we often overlook the deeper reasons they cause so much misery to our animals. After all, tapeworms, fleas, ticks, mites, and other sucking insects have coexisted with animals for millions of years, which implies that there must be natural provi- sions to allow for a more harmonious coexistence. How did animals cope before humanity developed poisons and vaccines to reduce parasite populations? Did all animals suffer from chronic prob- lems such as flea allergies, digestive dys- function, or heart disease because they were infested with too many parasites? Of course not. Then why do some ani- mals nowadays live their entire lives virtu- ally undisturbed by parasites, while oth- ers with the same level of exposure are constantly tormented by them? To find the answers to such questions, we need to step away from our antiparasitic obsessions long enough to consider the life of a parasite. HOLISTIC APPROACHES Parasites, as repulsive as the fact may be, exist inside and on top of every living thing on earth. They even live on each other. In fact, a body (human or other- wise) is home for a teeming biocom- munity of millions of interdependent life-forms, many of which happen to be parasites. From a holistic perspective, An Herbal Repertory for Animals 265 parasite-related health problems ema- nate not from the mere presence of these vampires but from the host’s inability to deal with them effectively. Some animals may test positive for Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) but never suffer ill health. On the other hand, some animals who appear to be healthy cannot tolerate a single fleabite without getting sick. Parasites are opportunity seekers that exploit the weaknesses of their host. Their goal in doing so is to reproduce and take control of their environment. If the host is malnourished and poorly equipped to keep parasite populations in check, the parasites will take advantage of the body’s inadequate defenses and begin reproducing, eating, and creating waste faster than the body can clean and replenish itself. If the immune system is dysfunctional and responds too aggres- sively to the parasites, an “allergic response” occurs. The most effective and holistic approach to parasite infection is to keep your animal well nourished and healthy. An animal with a strong, properly func- tioning immune system presents an inhospitable living environment for par- asites and is less likely to suffer from par- asite-related allergies. But there’s still an important question to be asked before the holistic picture is complete: What happens to this scenario when we give in to our hatred and fear of parasites and opt to use preventive drug meas- ures in our pets? Any answer to this question is likely to raise controversy. Antiparasitic drugs represent a multibil- lion-dollar industry in the U.S., and many veterinarians support manufactur- ers’ claims that modern dewormers, skin-absorbed flea control agents, and other internal measures are effective and generally safe. On the other side of the issue, though, holistic practitioners and naturally oriented animal guardians are concerned about the serious long- term effects associated with such drugs. Of course, we’re among those on this side of the issue, and here’s why. To start with, anything that can poi- son a parasite cannot be good for the host. From a holistic standpoint, any- thing that bypasses or interferes with nat- ural body functions is likely to create its own state of imbalance in the body. For instance, chemical wormers (aside from being potentially toxic to animals) are not 100 percent selective in what they kill, meaning that beneficial microbes, such as those that play important roles in digestion and nutrient absorption, might be compromised. In addition to this pos- sibility, most antiparasitic agents come with their own long lists of potential side effects, including seizures, liver failure, or even death. Ivermectin, a drug common- ly used to treat and prevent heartworm infection, may not only cause central nervous system depression but also act as an immunosuppressant. That is, while it works to kill heartworms it also makes the body more vulnerable to countless other diseases. The holistic herbalist does not see par- asites as a cause of disease but as symp- toms of a deeper imbalance. Parasites themselves are viewed as what they real- ly are—tough, adaptable, ancient life- forms that will likely inhabit the earth long after humankind is gone. They are part of nature. Therefore, effective natu- ral solutions to parasite-related disorders are not found through fervent and dan- gerous attempts to destroy them but from learning to coexist with them. In our minds (and remember, we’re herbalists, not veterinarians), stopping a symptom with chemicals that can harm the patient does not constitute preven- tive or curative medicine—it only repre- sents a dangerous, short-term interven- tion that may actually compound the ani- Herbs for Pets 266 mal’s health problems. Indeed, some forms of parasitic infection can be serious, even life threatening. The benefits of antiparasitic drugs are their convenience and their effectiveness at bringing symp- tomatic relief to an animal who is already suffering. But what are the potential costs to the animal? To find answers, check the back label or product information sheet for a list of side effects of the next antipar- asitic drug you consider for your compan- ion. Regardless of the danger issues, you owe your animal the opportunity to stay healthy and naturally free from parasite- related problems. This, of course, is what holistic animal care is all about. NUTRITION AND OTHER PREVENTION CONSIDERATIONS As we’ve stated before, the most effec- tive treatment and prevention for all problems related to parasites is to make sure your companion gets the nutrition he needs. Without a complete natural diet, your animal’s resistance and ability to adjust to parasites is greatly dimin- ished. Equally important is the need to identify and correct any element of diet, environment, or activity that may be causing added stress on one or more body systems. If, for instance, your dog has an allergy to the wheat he receives in his daily meals, his immune system will already be compromised when new parasites enter his body. Likewise, if he has undergone long-term drug thera- pies, his immune system may be in a depressed state and his defenses may be low. Remember that parasites are opportunity seekers. Digestive enzymes and probiotic bac- teria supplements can be of help in main- taining a healthy balance between potentially harmful “digestive bugs,” and those that lead the preventive fights for good health. A full array of vitamins and minerals is necessary to keep the blood healthy and the immune system operat- ing at its peak potential. Omega-3 and omega-6 EFAs, along with the proper balance of antioxidant vitamins (especial- ly C, A, and E) and minerals, are neces- sary for healthy, resilient skin that offers less opportunity for enterprising mites, fleas, and parasitic fungi. In addition to vitamin C’s roles as an essential nutrient and antioxidant, it has been shown to lend allergy relief through the antihista- mine qualities it possesses. Exercise is also important, as is a clean environment. The harder you work at helping your animal stay healthy, the less time and money you’ll spend on treating parasite-related problems after the fact. As is the case in all forms of medicine, prevention truly is the cure. FLEAS Animals who are hypersensitive to fleas may suffer a severe reaction from a single bite—so severe that they pull their hair out and chew bloody patches from their skin. Conventional approaches to flea-contact dermatitis typically start with medicated shampoos, flea control devices, and corti- coid ointments and then lead to internal corticosteroid drug therapies if conditions worsen. Anyone who has watched a com- panion suffer from a flea allergy knows how easy it is to look past the dangers of prednisolone. The problem is, pred- nisolone and other corticosteroid drugs don’t just suppress uncomfortable symp- toms but they also suppress the immune system. Add to this the possible long- term side effects of water retention, hypertension, liver damage, thyroid dysfunction, obesity, and heart attack, and suddenly the corticosteroid option doesn’t sound so kind. To approach the flea dilemma from a holistic standpoint means to embrace a perspective that includes the animal as a whole body in crisis. We must ask our- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 267 selves why fleas are bothering our ani- mals in the first place rather than focus solely on their elimination. Effective flea control starts inside your pet and in his living environment. Holistic therapy does not begin with shampoos, coat dips, rins- es, or sprays; it begins by strengthening the host and by making your animal’s liv- ing quarters less hospitable to fleas. It’s important to remember that flea prob- lems are always secondary to something else, and it’s that “something else” that makes your companion an attractive “bed and breakfast” for fleas. Healthy animals with healthy coats and properly functioning immune defenses generally don’t have many fleas. And even if healthy animals do pick up a few fleas, their systems are able to handle the bites without the excessive histamine respons- es that cause all of the itching. To help your healthy animal deal with parasites comfortably, feed him small amounts of garlic as a supplement to a proper diet. Contrary to what many believe, though, garlic should not be fed in quantities that cause that garlic odor to exude from the animal’s skin. This is not only a waste of garlic but potentially harmful to your animal. Dietary supplementation with brew- er’s yeast and vitamin B complex have been popular for years as antiflea meas- ures, the theory being that these supple- ments adjust body chemistry in a way that makes the animal less appealing to fleas. The effectiveness of such measures is questionable, and many animals are allergic to brewer’s yeast (especially if it is low grade), but nevertheless, these sup- plements are worth a try. If your animal has an autoimmune defi- ciency, immunostimulants such as echi- nacea, Saint-John’s-wort, or astragalus may be of help. However, immunostimulants should be used with caution or may be contraindicated in animals with severe allergies or other diseases that are associat- ed with an overactive immune system or with immune functions that are working against the body (such as lupus and FIV). In addition to garlic, alterative herbs such as burdock root, dandelion, and red clover serve as useful dietary adjuncts by helping the body eliminate waste and allowing natural defense systems to work more freely in coping with fleabites. Nettle may be sprinkled onto your ani- mal’s food to lend nutritive support and a mild antihistamine action that may reduce the severity of an allergic response. Giving 1⁄2–1 teaspoon of the dried herb for each pound of food fed is a good starting dosage range. If your ani- mal won’t eat dried nettle, you can steep it in hot water or salt-free meat broth, which you can then add to your compan- ion’s food. Oxeye daisy (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), a common waste-area weed, is also said to have mild antihista- mine qualities that don’t really block Nettle (dried or steeped in hot water or broth) can reduce an animal’s allergic response to fleas. Herbs for Pets 268 histamine but may help slow its release. If fleabite allergies are severe, itching is persistent, and the skin is red and inflamed, licorice can be used as an inter- nal anti-inflammatory remedy. Externally, fleas and their effects can be addressed several ways. The animals’ living environment can be sprinkled with diatomaceous earth, the sandlike remains of ancient marine organisms. Its activity against parasites is strictly mechanical, as each tiny particle has sharp points and edges that penetrate the bodies of fleas to cause their miserable deaths. Because of its gritty, penetrating nature, diatoma- ceous earth should not be applied to dry, irritated, hypersensitive skin, and it should never be allowed to contact eyes or other mucous membranes. Care also needs to be taken when spreading the substance onto carpets since walking around can stir up the dust and may cause silicosis, a form of pneumonia relat- ed to breathing the dust of silica and other sands. Otherwise it’s generally quite safe. In fact, it’s approved by the FDA for both internal and external use in livestock animals and has been used safe- ly in the natural care of companion ani- mals for years. Some pet owners may have heard that borax products are good flea exter- minators, but borates can be quite toxic and may cause death if misused, accord- ing to Dr. Michael W. Dryden of the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA). One of the manufacturers of borax states that borax is not intended for application to carpet and upholstery. Frequent vacuuming, washing your animal’s bedding, and regularly steam- cleaning your carpet also helps reduce flea populations in the environment. Some products made with nematodes are available to “infect” and kill fleas where they live in your house and in the lawns around the house. All of these measures are available through natural pet-product retailers. To help eliminate fleas from your ani- mal’s coat and to soothe and heal his itchy skin, several herbs come to mind. Flowers of feverfew, pyrethrum daisy, or oxeye daisy (or just about any other flower from the Chrysanthemum genus) contain com- pounds known as pyrethrins. Pyrethrins are well known to have paralytic activities in fleas. In fact, pyrethrins and their syn- thesized derivatives are common in many brands of flea spray. In their natural form, pyrethrins are safe and can be quite effec- tive. Pyrethrins used in the form of a crude herbal preparation, however, won’t always kill fleas but may only paralyze them temporarily. This means you should take additional measures to assure that fleas are out of your life forever. Making a pyrethrin flea rinse is as sim- ple as plucking a few handfuls of feverfew flowers, putting them into a cup, and steeping them in enough hot water to cover them. Briskly stir the mixture every couple of minutes until the mixture is cool enough to pour over your pet. You can strain the tea away from the flowers HERBAL FLEA REPELLENT POWDER Combine the following dry ingre- dients: 1 part diatomaceous earth 2 parts feverfew flowers 2 parts mullein flowers 2 parts yarrow flowers, leaves, and stems 1 part sage or thyme Sprinkle and brush into your animal’s coat daily An Herbal Repertory for Animals 269 or just pour the entire mixture over your pet, but use the rinse right away—the active compounds break down and lose potency shortly after the tea is made. Be sure to soak the animal all the way down to the skin, and allow the rinse to air dry on your companion until the fur is damp but not dripping. Then, at a location that is as far away from the house as possible (remember, many of the fleas will recov- er with a hunger), rinse the animal with a strong stream of water while combing his coat, and look for paralyzed vampires. Other flea-killing plant compounds include rotenone and limonene. Rotenone is readily available in the flowers of mullein (Verbascum thapsus), an Asian weed that occurs in waste areas throughout most of North America and Europe. The flowering tops are best if used fresh in the form of a strong decoction, but the dried blossoms (available through herb retailers) can be used too, again in the form of a cooled tea. When using mullein flowers or any other form of rotenone, be sure to keep the herb away from fish tanks or any amphibians— although it’s safe for mammals, it is quite toxic to aquatic life forms. Limonene is a volatile oil found in citrus and many of the culinary herbs belonging to the parsley (Umbelliferae) family. A good source of limonene is contained in celery seeds (up to 60 percent limonene). For the best results, harvest the seeds while they are green and juicy, and make a tea rinse immediately. Good-quality dried seeds can be used as a second source. Other limonene-bearing “umbels” include dill (leaf and seed) and fennel (seed). Another herb that has been regaining popularity in recent years as an antiflea device is Canadian fleabane (Conyza canadensis). Until recently, Canadian flea- bane (also called horseweed) was known by herbalists primarily as a urinary astrin- gent. Its common name has caught the attention of several natural pet-product manufacturers, who claim that it is one of nature’s greatest allies against fleas. Current research has concluded that Canadian fleabane contains flea-killing limonene as well. A much stronger source of limonene is essential oil of bit- ter orange, available through most stores that carry aromatherapy oils. This essen- tial oil is very concentrated—just 6–10 drops diluted into 8 ounces of water is said to be an effective rinse against fleas. Simply moisten the animal’s skin and coat with the mixture daily. GARLIC AND MULLEIN EAR OIL Combine the following: 1 part garlic oil 1 part mullein oil 10–20 drops of vitamin E oil for each 1 oz of the garlic and mullein oil mixture For instructions on how to make an herb oil, turn to the “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1. Apply oxeye daisy flowers as a flea rinse. Herbs for Pets 270 To help relieve itching and promote healing, a calendula rinse is a good choice, as is aloe juice, which can be diluted with 4 parts water (e.g., 1 cup of aloe juice to 4 cups of water). Peppermint or lavender may help bring relief as well. If scratching has left oozing, infected scabs, yarrow, rosemary, or thyme can be generously added to the rinse. One advantage of using yarrow is that it adds its own insect-repellent qual- ities to the effort. If inflammation is severe and scratching has lead to hair loss, an astringent skin rinse may be indi- cated. Also, many good herbal flea and coat shampoos are on the market. These can be useful for bringing soothing relief. Don’t shampoo your animal too often, though, or you might dry out the skin and cause added irritation. When using shampoos, also remember that their overuse can result in microbial imbal- ances on the surface of the body. Your animal’s skin supports a natural commu- nity of interdependent organisms, many of which serve antiparasitic or cleansing purposes. To let them do their jobs it’s probably best not to shampoo your ani- mal more than once or twice a week dur- ing a crisis. By now you might be wondering why we haven’t mentioned North American pennyroyal (Hedeoma pulegioides). Well, we won’t argue about the effectiveness of pennyroyal at deterring fleas. In fact, it’s one of the best antiflea herbs around, which is why it is included in dozens of commercial flea preparations. The prob- lem with it is that the volatile oils (com- posed mostly of an oil called pulegone) contained in pennyroyal can be toxic to animals, with the list of potential side effects beginning with nausea, vomiting, and abortifacient properties and ending with elevated blood pressure and possi- ble kidney and liver damage. While most flea dips, sprays, and powders that con- tain pennyroyal include relatively dilute concentrations of the volatile oil, a cumu- lative risk may exist to animals who lick off these topical preparations. Cats can be very sensitive to pennyroyal, and those with preexisting kidney disease (a widespread, chronic problem in cats) might even die from it. In our minds, such risks are unnecessary in the pres- ence of safer, more holistic flea control measures. One such measure is the Triple-Punch Herbal Flea Rinse. Herbal flea powders usually aren’t as effective as rinses, but they are handy for animals and people on the go. The key to success in making a powder is to be sure that all of the herbal ingredients are as fresh as possible. Pyrethrin-bearing plants lose much of their potency after they are dried, and aromatic herbs such as laven- der or yarrow lose their flea-repellent pungency eventually. The best you can TRIPLE-PUNCH HERBAL FLEA RINSE 1 part feverfew flowers 1 part mullein flowers (keep away from aquatic animals!) 1 part yarrow flowers, leaves, and stems 1 part celery seeds (freshly ground) 3 parts calendula flowers Make a tea rinse of the herbs by cov- ering the mixture with boiling water and allowing it to stand until cooled. To add even more “punch” to the formula, 6–10 drops of Bitter Orange essential oil can be added to each 8 ounces of rinse. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 271 hope for with a homemade flea powder is “flea discouragement.” It’s unlikely that you will succeed in eliminating or repelling every biting flea without taking other measures as well. To keep your flea powder as fresh and active as possible, make it in small, frequent batches. An electric coffee grinder or a mortar and pestle can be used to grind your herbs into powder. MITES Mites are an excellent example of just how common parasites are. These tiny, often microscopic, arachnids are every- where and on everything. A healthy human body carries millions of them. In fact, all living land animals carry mites— even fleas and mites have mites! When you’re finished scratching, it’s important to know that relatively few of the parasitic varieties of mites cause problems. Those that do cause problems burrow under the top layers of the skin to cause hair loss, skin disfigurement, and painful lesions on the skin and in the ears. In dogs, cats, horses, and other mam- mals, various species of skin mites are commonly referred to as mange. In instances of human infection, we usually refer to them as scabies. Various species of mange are differenti- ated by the specific nature of the infec- tions they cause. Sarcoptic mange (Sarcoptes scabiei) is the most contagious (some species can be transmitted to humans) and often the most severe form of mange, characterized most frequently by crusty, reddish brown lesions that usu- ally appear first on the head and neck, between the legs, or in the “armpits” of the victim animal. Demodectic mange, or red mange (genus Demodex), is a far less contagious mite that infects hair follicles, often causing hair loss and a foul-smelling bacterial infection of the skin. Both chori- optic mange (genus Chorioptis) and psoroptic mange (genus Psoroptes) are common in cattle, horses, sheep, and goats and produce similar symptoms. Otitis externa, or otodectic ear mange, occurs in dogs and cats and is character- ized by inflammation and brown, waxy discharge from the ears. Rabbits are sus- ceptible to ear mange as well. Occurrence of ear mites in horses and other large ani- mals is relatively uncommon. All of the mange-causing mites have one thing in common: they are all oppor- tunity-seeking parasites that prefer a defenseless host. Therefore, prevention in the form of a well-balanced natural diet that provides immune system support should begin before an infection occurs. Fortunately, herbal measures can be quite effective against the various forms of mange. The foremost herb to consider is garlic. Mites don’t tolerate sulfur com- pounds, and garlic contains hundreds of them (which is why garlic smells like it does). For ear mites or localized mite infestations on birds and mammals, gar- lic oil can be applied to the affected areas twice daily. In addition to its direct inter- vention with mites, garlic oil helps mini- mize bacterial infection. When using gar- lic oil, however, make sure that it’s not too concentrated or it may cause irrita- tion. Another good ear mite herb is mullein flower oil. Mullein flowers pos- sess antiparasitic and antibacterial activi- ties that seem well suited to infections of the ear, especially when combined with garlic oil. Vitamin E oil can be added to this combination to help promote heal- ing. The olive oil used as a base for both of these oils also lends soothing and heal- ing qualities to the skin. For mange infestations that are local- ized close to the eyes of an animal, you will probably want to purchase or make an ointment or salve preparation. This minimizes the risk of the herb contacting the eyes. Herbs for Pets 272 Other herbs to consider for mite infec- tions are lavender, yarrow, Oregon grape, goldenseal (provided it is from cultivated sources), and licorice. Any of these herbs can be used in oils, salves, or ointments as well, or they can be made into a skin rinse (a good option for infections that are gen- eralized over larger portions of the ani- mal’s body). Licorice serves as a good alternative for animals who are sensitive to topical applications of garlic. If you have access to it, neem leaf (Azadirachta indica), from a tree found in India and Pakistan, can make an effective skin rinse against many forms of mange. For birds who are crawling with mites, a pinch of Oregon grape or lavender can be infused into their birdbath. For lizards with mite infections, a wet towel wipe of weak Oregon grape, yarrow, or lavender tea might help. LICE Several species of lice can infest both mammals and birds. They can generally be divided into two categories: those that suck blood from their hosts (Anopleura) and those that bite their vic- tims (Mallophaga). Regardless, the term lousy is derived from the concept of louse infestation, and the repulsiveness the word conveys describes the situation accurately. Louse infestation is a common problem for animals who live in cramped or unclean living quarters. The problem is characterized by irritated, itchy skin and frequent scratching. Lice are tough critters and can be hard to beat with herbs. The most effec- tive and time-honored herb approaches for lice include toxic heavyweights such as tansy (Tanacetum vulgare) and even water hemlock (Cicuta spp.), either of which can kill an animal host. On the safer side of the herbal spectrum are licorice, yucca, wormwood, sage, yarrow, yellow dock, lavender, and bee balm. All of these herbs can be used singly or in combination in the form of a daily skin rinse. A daily sprinkling of diatomaceous earth onto the animal’s coat may be effective, too. INTESTINAL WORMS Worms are often viewed as parasites at their most disgusting worst, but again this is largely because we have a big problem with the thought of things crawling around inside our bodies. Sorry if this gives you the “crawlies,” but worms are a natural fact of life. We all have them in one form or another. Animal guardians tend to overreact to the possibility of worms with the precau- tionary use of chemical wormers. As we mentioned earlier, such practice is con- trary and counterproductive to the pur- poses of holistic health care. We are not saying that worms cannot be life threat- ening but that the health risks associated with preventive drug therapies may out- weigh the actual need for them, especial- ly in healthy animals who are not likely to be exposed to roundworms, whipworms, or hookworms. The most common type of intestinal parasites are known as cestodes, or tape- worms. Tapeworms can be transmitted by fleas, feces, or food sources. In rural areas, dogs and cats often become infected by eating rodents. Tapeworms may live in an animal’s digestive tract for quite a while, sometimes indefinitely, before they are detected, and they are seldom harmful to the host animal. Usually, we won’t even know that our companions have tapeworms until a fecal analysis is done or until we see the worms’ body segments in the animals’ stools. The segments (put your sandwich down!) look very much like grains of rice. The potential of tapeworms to cause harm to an animal is relative to the gen- eral health of the animal and the extent An Herbal Repertory for Animals 273 of the tapeworm infestation. In other words, if an animal is generally healthy, a moderate population of intestine- dwelling tapeworms is usually harmless. And if the animal is holistically healthy, has a strong immune system, properly balanced intestinal flora, and is being fed a good diet, tapeworm infestations are likely to be a temporary issue. For instance, we live on 60 remote acres in the Montana Rockies, where our two dogs roam freely around the house. Both occasionally eat a ground squirrel or two (sometimes in the form of carrion), and we expect both of them to have tape- worms by the end of summer. But because they are healthy, most if not all of the worms (as confirmed by fecal analysis) are gone from their bodies after a couple of months of infestation. The opportunity seekers just can’t find a stronghold, or they don’t like the accom- modations. It’s our contention that in most instances, the reason tapeworms are approached with chemical interventions is not always because a real and urgent need to eliminate them exists but because we can’t deal with their less- than-appealing nature. Yes, they’re dis- gusting. But are we really helping an ani- mal when we use unnecessary, potential- ly toxic measures to expel them? We don’t think so. Roundworms, hookworms, whip- worms, and threadworms present a much greater risk to your companion because these worms can cause severe intestinal damage and can leave the digestive tract to infest the blood and other organs. Once these parasites leave the digestive tract, they can be difficult to treat. To help your dog or cat keep intestin- al populations in check and to encourage earlier expulsion by less invasive, more natural means, garlic can be fed in mod- eration on the animal’s food. Fennel, grated raw carrot, shredded coconut, and cooked grains also might be of ben- efit if added to the animal’s diet. (Feed as much as the animal wants to eat.) Fresh, raw, unsalted pumpkin seeds help expel worms and generous portions can be fed as a wholesome treat to any animal. The seeds may need to be ground up and added to your pet’s food. (You can grind a small batch ahead of time and keep it in a jar in the freezer until you’re ready to use it.) Diatomaceous earth is effective at reducing intestinal parasite populations and can be fed at the following recom- mended rates (approved by the FDA)— large dogs over 55 pounds can have up to 1 tablespoon per day, small dogs and cats can have 1 teaspoon per day. Goats, sheep, cattle, horses, and other large ani- mals can be fed in portions up to 1 per- ANTIWORM FOOD SUPPLEMENT Combine the following dry ingre- dients: 2 parts unsalted, raw pumpkin seeds (ground or whole) 1 part garlic powder 1 part fennel seed 1 part yucca root Feed the mixture as part of your companion’s diet at a dosage of 1 teaspoon per pound of food fed daily. Feed five days on and two days off each week until worm pop- ulations are reduced to acceptable levels. If this formula proves to be ineffective, try adding 1 part Oregon grape root powder or 1 part wormwood. Herbs for Pets 274 cent of their daily dry rations; and chick- ens and most birds can receive up to 5 percent. Oregon grape may be given internally to birds, dogs, cats, horses, and other mammals as a low-alcohol tincture or decoction. A dose of 12 drops per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight (or just a few drops for birds), twice daily for up to one week is appropriate. After one week, give the animal’s system a break for two or three days before continuing the twice-daily doses. Chamomile has mild worm-expelling properties, and pineapple weed (Matricaria matricari- oides), a wild and weedy cousin of chamomile, is believed to possess much stronger activities against roundworms and whipworms. Other worming agents include black walnut and wormwood. Black walnut hull is an effective worming agent, but it must be used with care because of the potentially irritating tannin con- stituents it contains. Black walnut should not be used in or around horses, as it may be toxic to them. Wormwood, of course, is a classic dewormer, but it should not be used for long periods and not at all in animals with liver disease. Even more dangerous are tansy and rue. In our opinion, these herbs should be avoided altogether because they’re too harsh on the liver. Herbs that are rich in soaplike saponin constituents such as yucca, valerian, and licorice are sometimes effective as worm- ing agents. Yucca also helps by optimiz- ing absorption of nutrients in the small intestine, an attribute that might be use- ful in cases of severe infection in which nutrient absorption is hindered by the presence of too many hungry parasites. Many herbal wormers contain laxative or emetic herbs such as senna, cascara sagrada, aloe, or turkey rhubarb. The idea behind their inclusion is to flush out the parasites by stimulating bowel move- ment and loosening the stool. In holistic reality, this approach adds stress to the body, causes discomfort to the animal, may cause dehydration and nutrient depletion, and may lead to laxative dependency if used for too long a period. The overall effectiveness of expelling worms is outweighed by the invasiveness of the therapy. If constipation is associat- ed with a worm infestation, marshmal- low, plantain, or slippery elm can be used to lubricate the digestive tract without pulling needed fluids from the body, and hepatics such as yellow dock, Oregon grape, or a small pinch of turmeric can be fed to increase bile production and improve digestion. Slippery elm or plan- tain may be beneficial in cases of worm- related diarrhea because these herbs con- tain astringent qualities that gently regu- late the passage of fluid into the intes- tine. A safe, general worming remedy that can be added to your companion’s food can be found on page 273. GIARDIASIS Giardiasis is a digestive disease caused by cyst-forming impregnation of protozoa of the Giardia genus in the mucosal lining of the intestines. The result is nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and other flulike symptoms for several weeks. The most common means of infestation comes from ingestion of water that has been contaminated by the fecal matter of fish and other animals. Animals are much more resistant to Giardia than humans are, but they are still susceptible. As with all parasites, severity of infestation depends on the overall health of the host. Symptoms range from loss of appetite to diarrhea, vomiting, weight loss, dehydration, and general debility. Herbal interventions are moderately successful at best. Tinctures are the best form of application here because their high concentrations of readily available An Herbal Repertory for Animals 275 constituents are needed against these tough little beasties. Of particular interest are Oregon grape, goldenseal (from cul- tivated sources), and other herbs that contain the active alkaloid constituent berberine. Berberine, being water solu- ble, highly assimilable, and able to with- stand the digestive acids that destroy many other types of antibiotic agents, finds it way deep into the digestive tract to work its wonders, especially when given in concentrated extract form over periods of several days. Garlic may lend antiprotozoa support as well. Licorice is a good adjunct, lending antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and healing proper- ties to the effort. Cleavers helps drain lymph-engorged tissues that surround the cysts. HEARTWORM The term heartworm is really a mis- nomer, as the parasitic worm (Dirofilaria immitis) that causes the disease usually infects the pulmonary arteries, not the heart itself. Heartworm is generally passed by mosquitoes, who pick up the parasite from the bloodstreams of dogs (less fre- quently from cats and ferrets) while the worms are in their prelarval stage. While inside the mosquito, the infant parasites called microfilaria mature into infective adults that are deposited into other host animals. After two to four months, the parasites penetrate blood vessel walls and travel to the pulmonary arteries, where they reproduce if conditions are right. While the worms are in the pul- monary arteries, the body launches an immunologic attack against them. If the worms have already reproduced to num- bers that the immune system cannot effectively control, an allergic response ensues, and the pulmonary arteries and surrounding lung tissues may become severely inflamed, causing a life-threaten- ing situation. Animals with advanced stages of heartworm infestation may exhibit chronic coughing; labored breathing; diminished physical stamina and a low tolerance to stress; weight loss; and heart failure. Unfortunately, the scenario becomes even more frightening when we consider conventional treatment of the disease, which involves the use of thiacetar- samide, an intravenously administered arsenic derivative that poisons the para- sites at great expense to the host animal’s liver. In our opinion and that of several holistic veterinarians, the deworming medication ivermectin and other preven- A REMEDY FOR GIARDIASIS Combine the following tinctures: 2 parts Oregon grape 2 parts licorice 2 parts cleavers 1 part garlic This formula can be fed to dogs, cats, birds, horses, and other large herbivores at least one hour before feeding, at a dosage of about 1⁄4 tea- spoon (1 milliliter) per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily for up to ten days. If positive results aren’t seen within ten days, it’s time to call your holistic vet. Low-alcohol tinctures are best because of their relative ease of administering, but alcohol tinctures can be used provided they are dilut- ed to half-strength with water, which means you will have to give the animal twice the liquid volume. Herbs for Pets 276 tive measures for heartworm can also be detrimental to an animal, which brings us to an especially important point in the prevention of the disease. In some areas of the U.S., heartworm is a real and constant threat to compan- ion animals. But in many areas of North America, it is more of a fear-induced paranoia than an actual danger. In Montana, for instance (where we live), heartworm is almost unheard of. Unfortunately, horror stories about heart- worm lead many people to medicate their animals anyway. We believe that people should rationally weigh the pros and cons as well as the need of adminis- tering a preventive heartworm treatment to their animal companions. Another problem arises from the blood and antigen tests that are per- formed to detect heartworms. In these tests, 30 percent of infested dogs do not test positive, meaning that the disease may progress unchecked. Likewise, a positive test for heartworm does not nec- essarily mean that the parasites will become problematic, especially if the host animal is healthy. Natural prevention of heartworm begins with identifying just how much “at risk” your companion is. If you live in a high-risk area, your animal’s coat should never be cut. Allow it to grow to full length and serve its natural function as an antimosquito barrier. Areas where mosquito populations are especially high (such as swamps, sloughs, and other breeding grounds) should be avoided, and perhaps a tightly knit cotton or breathable nylon garment is in order for shorthaired dogs. (Several clothing cat- alogs for dogs are available.) Proper nutrition and tonic immune system sup- port will build and maintain your com- panion’s resistance to the parasite. In addition to a full array of supplemental vitamins and minerals, garlic can be added to an animal’s diet to strengthen the immune system. When venturing into higher-risk areas, echinacea can be preventatively administered for two or three days before the excursion and continue for three days after. If your animal does contract heart- worm, don’t panic. Instead, continue supporting the immune system and call your holistic veterinarian to determine the next step of action. There are many options. Among them may be black wal- nut hull tincture (made from unripe green hulls instead of dried ones). As of 1999, we had been contacted by several individuals who claim that black walnut hull may be effective at controlling the parasites. Given what we know about this herb and the parasite, we remain skepti- cal but hopeful that clinical use will vali- date this claim. Pregnancy and Lactation One of the most frequently asked ques- tions we hear as animal herbalists is, What should I be giving to a pregnant animal? Our response is often a cause of disappointment: Aside from the elements of good nutrition, as little as possible. During pregnancy and lactation, a mother’s body is in a state of continual hormonal fluctuation. Her nutritional demands change as her body experi- ences a roller-coaster ride of metabolic events that are incomparable to any other experience. It is a period when her body must maintain delicate checks and balances while responding to unprece- dented demands. These are times when the proactive efforts of an animal herbal- ist really pay off. Having received a good natural diet, a healthy living environ- ment, and complementary measures of health-supporting vitamin, mineral, and herb supplements throughout her life, the pregnant animal is physically and mentally prepared to undertake the rig- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 277 ors of childbirth and motherhood. This is a time when the body should be allowed to work its natural wonders without interference from introduced stimulation, suppression, or irritation. With this in mind, the bigger and better question is, What herbs shouldn’t be used in preg- nant or lactating animals? HERBS TO AVOID Many herbs should not be given to pregnant or lactating animals. Herbs that contain considerable amounts of volatile oil constituents such as juniper, any of the aromatic mints, and parsley seed should not be used during preg- nancy because the oils are capable of crossing the placenta to the fetus. Volatile oils may also infiltrate a moth- er’s milk, so these herbs should be avoided during lactation as well. Herbs that stimulate or suppress hormone production should also be avoided— these include licorice, wild yam, and yucca root. Herbs that are high in tan- nin constituents such as uva ursi, white oak bark, black walnut hulls, and slip- pery elm may cause uterine contrac- tions and miscarriage. Herbal laxatives that contain anthraquinone con- stituents such as senna, cascara sagra- da, turkey rhubarb, and yellow dock should be avoided as well. If your com- panion becomes constipated during pregnancy, try lubricating her digestive tract by feeding marshmallow, flaxseed, or psyllium husks. Chickweed can also serve as a safe and effective laxative in pregnant animals. Herbs that contain large percentages of bitter alkaloids such as Oregon grape and goldenseal may have abortifacient activities and should not be used. Red clover, feverfew, and ginkgo all inhibit platelet aggregation in the blood and may contribute to excessive hemor- rhage during or after birthing. In summary, if you’re not sure about the safety of an herb during pregnancy, assume that it’s contraindicated and don’t use it! TONIC SUPPORT Contrary to what many herbalists regard as tradition, we do not use most of the “classic birthing and pregnancy herbs” (such as blue cohosh) during this fragile time. Instead, our approach is strictly nutritive. Raspberry leaf tea has been long regarded as an excellent uterine tonic for pregnant humans and animals, but it should not be given during the first few weeks of pregnancy. Nor should it be fed in large amounts, as there is a small risk that its astringent activities may trig- ger abortion in sensitive animals (espe- cially cats). In our opinion, nettle leaf and spirulina are both better choices as uter- ine tonics because they contain higher concentrations and broader assortments of essential and trace minerals and vita- mins. This means they can be fed more conservatively, and the risk (as low as that risk may be) of inducing uterine con- tractions is thereby reduced. HERBS AND LACTATION Healthy animals who receive all necessary elements of nutrition during motherhood should have no problems with milk pro- duction or quality. If a nursing mother is not providing her young with enough milk, it’s probably because of a nutrition- al deficiency, hormonal imbalance, or another dysfunction. Fennel seed, bor- age, dill, and yucca root are all said to increase milk production in nursing mothers, but these herbs are useful only to healthy animals who need more milk to feed a big, hungry litter. If your dog or cat has given birth to a small- or average- sized litter and is having trouble feeding her young, then deeper problems need to be addressed before you start trying to Herbs for Pets 278 induce milk production. Forcing a moth- er’s body to perform beyond its capacity with estrogenic herbs may only worsen an already serious situation. In many cases, switching an animal from a com- mercial diet to one that offers a diversity of whole, raw foods makes a world of dif- ference. Moderate quantities of supple- mental vitamins, minerals, probiotics, and EFAs can be of tremendous help as well because lactation can deplete an animal’s reserve supply of vital nutrients. In cats, this depletion can cause a life- threatening deficiency of taurine, an amino acid that is critical to the heart. Respiratory Problems COUGHING AND SNEEZING: NATURAL HEALING MECHANISMS Occasional coughing or sneezing is part of a body’s normal health maintenance program. Most animal guardians know that when dust particles, pollen, or other foreign matter enters the trachea, spasms are triggered to expel the material from the body. Yet many people try to sup- press coughing and sneezing rather than allow the body to do its job because the conventional Western mind-set dictates that anything that is socially offensive or that causes discomfort must be sup- pressed. To tend to an animal’s holistic health needs, we must learn to control our urge to interfere with the body’s nat- ural functions. Suppressing activities such as sneezing, coughing, and discharging mucus deprives the body of its natural healing mechanisms and may actually contribute to the underlying disease by prohibiting expulsion of pathogenic microbes and other foreign substances. Instead of suppressing disease symp- toms, the holistic healer’s efforts are cen- tered on assisting the body to cleanse and heal itself. In the respiratory tract, this entails supporting and encouraging the productivity of coughing, sneezing, and expulsion of mucus. Most animals do not produce mucus as readily as humans do. Therefore, herbs and other remedies that serve as cough suppressants or dis- courage expectoration (such as wild cherry bark) should be reserved for spe- cial circumstances, such as when a con- tinuous, unproductive cough has deprived an animal of sleep for several days. Even then, such remedies should be used in moderation as adjuncts to herbs that support productive coughing. Many respiratory ailments can be treated at home with some simple herbal preparations. But if your companion’s coughing or sneezing continues or wors- ens, or if you have any doubt whatsoever about its cause, you should have your friend examined by a holistic vet. A per- sistent cough can mean minor throat irri- tation caused by chewing on a stick, or it can be a symptom of a life-threatening situation such as heartworm, pneumo- nia, cardiopulmonary disease, or a seri- ous viral infection. ASTHMA Asthma is characterized by a sudden onset of bronchial inflammation and res- piratory distress. Animals with severe asthma may begin an attack by wheez- ing, sneezing, and coughing, which may quickly progress to obstructed airways, labored breathing, and a life-threatening crisis. According to most veterinarians, dogs do not suffer from asthma, but this disease is known to occur frequently in cats and many other animals. Many people regard asthma as a cause of respiratory distress, but in most cases it’s really only a symptom of a deeper immune-mediated disorder. Asthma usually occurs as part of a severe allergic reaction. Therefore, holistic treat- ment does not focus solely on suppres- sion of asthma attacks but also on proac- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 279 tive correction of the dysfunctional mechanisms that trigger the attacks. (For more information on long-term holistic treatment, see “Allergies” in the “Immune System Care” sections of this chapter.) Symptomatic herbal treatments for non-life-threatening cases of asthma are essentially the same as those used for kennel cough and other forms of bron- chitis (see below). Lobelia may be useful for suppressing asthma attacks in cats, especially if a tincture is administered at the first signs of onset. Lobeline, the active constituent of lobelia, is potential- ly toxic (it has central nervous system effects similar to those of nicotine), so it should be administered only under the direction of a holistic veterinarian. BRONCHITIS AND KENNEL COUGH The term bronchitis refers to inflamma- tion of one or more of the large air pas- sages of the lungs. Causes are variable, ranging from inhalation of dust and other airborne irritants to viral, bacterial, or fungal infection; tumors; or cancer. An accumulation of mucus in the bronchi and a deep, rumbling cough are usually associated with bronchitis. Bronchitis that is secondary to bacter- ial, fungal, or viral infection is often accompanied by elevated body tempera- ture and mucus discharge. If your com- panion is coughing up fluid, take an unpleasant moment to examine it. If it’s pink, frothy, blood streaked, or bright yellow, get your companion and a speci- men of the discharge to a veterinarian immediately. Respiratory infections or bleeding progress rapidly and need to be treated aggressively. Kennel cough is a generic term for a dry, hacking cough that occurs in dogs and sometimes cats. It is caused by viral (such as canine adenovirus II, parain- fluenza) or bacterial infection (such as Bordetella bronchiseptica) and is generally self-limiting in that it rarely progresses beyond minor inflammation of the tra- chea. No discharge, fever, respiratory edema, or other symptoms are associ- ated with kennel cough—just coughing. This is an important point to remember because if your animal is exhibiting symptoms in addition to a hacking cough, you may be facing a condition more serious than kennel cough. Once diagnosed, kennel cough and most other types of bronchitis can be treated safely at home. If other animals in the home are susceptible to infection, take preventive measures to keep them healthy. We administer immune-support- ive herbs to our animals before, during, and after suspected exposure to infec- tious bronchitis. Dietary supplementation of fresh chopped garlic is a good preven- tive measure because garlic has excellent immunotonic qualities and antibacterial and antiviral principles that are exhaled Elecampane can decrease the symptoms and shorten the duration of bronchitis and kennel cough. Herbs for Pets 280 through the lungs. Astragalus or organi- cally grown echinacea are also well suit- ed for boosting your companion’s immune system against kennel cough before or during an infection. Eucalyptus essential oil can be placed into a vaporiz- er with some water and left within a few feet of your companion’s resting quar- ters. (Don’t use this method in conjunc- tion with a homeopathic prescription, as it may antidote the remedy.) The vapor helps open the animal’s respiratory pas- sages and provides a continuous measure of antimicrobial intervention. Coltsfoot, grindelia, mullein leaf, and elecampane offer antiviral, antibacterial, expectorant, and antispasmodic quali- ties that can help shorten the duration of your companion’s ailment. Yarrow is also strongly antimicrobial and helps increase pulmonary efficiency by dilat- ing blood vessels of the lungs. Slippery elm, plantain, and marshmallow each lend soothing relief to sore and inflamed AN HERBAL FORMULA FOR ASTHMA, KENNEL COUGH, AND BRONCHITIS WITH DRY COUGH* Combine the following low-alcohol (glycerin) tinctures: 1 part coltsfoot 1 part grindelia or elecampane 1 part mullein leaf 1 part yarrow 1 part marshmallow * This formula eases spastic cough- ing, fights bacterial infection, and soothes inflamed membranes. This combination can be added to a small amount of honey and fed to dogs or cats two or three times daily until the illness has run its course. An appropriate dose is 0.25–0.5 milliliters for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Additionally, a twice-daily dose of echinacea or astragalus is recommended for immune support. If the coughing is associated with nervousness or hyperexcitability, bugleweed, skullcap, valerian, hop, or a small measure of wild cherry bark can be added to the twice- daily regimen. AN HERBAL FORMULA FOR WET COUGHS 1 part coltsfoot 1 part goldenrod 1 part yarrow If your companion’s cough involves copious amounts of thick, hard-to- expel mucus, this formula serves to reduce inflammation of mucous membranes, reduce and thin mu- cous secretions in the bronchi, and help to make the cough less violent and more productive. This formula can be added to a small amount of honey and fed to dogs or cats two or three times daily until the illness has run its course. An appropriate dose is 0.25–0.5 milli- liters for each 20 pounds of the ani- mal’s body weight. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 281 membranes of the trachea and bronchi. Goldenrod is especially helpful in cases in which bronchial inflammation is yielding excessive mucus that the body cannot effectively expel (e.g., bronchial pneumonia). PNEUMONIA AND PULMONARY EDEMA Pneumonia is a condition in which lung volume and pulmonary efficiency is reduced by the presence of fluid (edema) or a solid mass (tumor). Pneumonia can originate from bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoan infection; allergy; cancer; injury, or systemic dysfunction. Pneumonia is a life-threatening situation that can be pro- gressive. Treatment varies according to the cause and symptoms. The term pulmonary edema refers to the presence of fluid in the lungs. With few exceptions (such as drowning), pul- monary edema is secondary to other dis- orders, such as congestive heart failure, inhalation of toxic chemicals, or damage of lung tissues. In cases of pneumonia or pulmonary edema, pulmonary (lung) efficiency is reduced so the blood does not receive the oxygen it needs to supply tissues throughout the body. In other words, the body progressively suffocates as the con- dition worsens. Symptoms at onset include reduced physical stamina; coughing, panting, or gasping for air; and diminished mental capacity. As the situation worsens, the tongue and mucous membranes of the eyes begin to turn blue from lack of oxygen, the animal becomes weak and lethargic, and the brain and other vital organs begin to die. Even if you have only a hunch that your animal may have pneumonia or a condi- tion involving pulmonary edema, the first course of action is to consult a veterinar- ian immediately to rule out the possibili- ty of a life-threatening situation. Don’t hesitate. Pneumonia can be aggressive in animals, especially those who are aging or weakened by chronic illness. Conventional approaches usually involve the use of furosemide or other strong diuretics to help move fluid out of the lungs, as well as antibiotic therapies directed toward any bacteria or fungi that might be involved. Once the nature of the problem has been identified and the animal’s condi- tion has stabilized, herbs can be used to strengthen the immune system and sup- port the body in its efforts to regain well- being. Large doses of a strong, dark dan- delion leaf tea (as much as you can get the animal to drink) serves as a strong diuretic to help with the elimination of fluid from the lungs. If the animal won’t drink the tea, use a salt-free meat or veg- etable broth instead of hot water or A TONIC FORMULA FOR ANIMALS WITH PNEUMONIA Combine the following glycerin- based herb tinctures: 2 parts echinacea 1 part astragalus 1 part coltsfoot 1 part yarrow This formula can be added to dan- delion leaf tea and fed two or three times daily until the disease has run its course. The dose for dogs, cats, and other small animals is 0.25–0.5 milliliters for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight. Horses and other large herbivores can receive 20–30 milliliters. Herbs for Pets 282 sweeten the tea with honey. Unlike the aforementioned furosemide, dandelion helps replace potassium and other nutri- ents that are usually lost through increased urination. Dandelion leaf tea should be fed con- tinuously. Provide as much as the animal will take throughout the therapy. Echinacea and garlic can be used to boost your companion’s immune system, and astragalus or Siberian ginseng may increase his body’s ability to function under the added stress. Coltsfoot and ele- campane are both good choices for stimu- lating respiratory function, inhibiting bac- terial reproduction, and helping with the elimination of mucus from the bronchi. Inhalation therapy using a vaporizer and eucalyptus oil (as mentioned for bronchi- tis) can also bring relief. Yarrow and cayenne can both increase pulmonary cir- culation and increase oxygen delivery to the blood. Used in combination with the diuretic qualities of dandelion leaf, these two herbs may be especially useful for racehorses who suffer acute respiratory bleeding and pulmonary edema as a result of strenuous exercise. Cayenne can also be used as part of this program as a respirato- ry stimulant and to assist the activities of the other herbs—one small gel cap daily for dogs and cats and five to ten large gel caps daily for horses. In animals who are suffering pulmonary edema secondary to congestive heart fail- ure or other cardiopulmonary problems, hawthorn, ginkgo, or bugleweed may be indicated. Other herbs worth considering in a wide variety of respiratory problems include horehound (excellent, but hard to administer because of its bitterness), thyme, rosemary, and lovage. Skin Problems Skin is something we tend to take for granted. After all, we see it all the time. It covers our dogs, cats, horses, birds, and our own bodies. And unlike treat- ments for a diseased organ that is hid- den deep and mysteriously within the body, our approaches to skin disorders are often as shallow as we perceive the skin itself to be. The skin regulates body temperature as well as peripheral blood and lymph cir- culation and provides frontline protec- tion from harmful influences that exist outside the body. The skin also helps with the elimination of systemic wastes that are not effectively eliminated through the urinary and digestive tracts. Therefore, what might appear to be nothing more than a superficial annoyance such as a skin disorder might indicate a serious underlying disease. Animals don’t com- plain as much as people do and are unable to express the discomforts of a deep-seated disease. That means the causes of a chronic skin problem may go unnoticed until they progress to a point where an animal is noticeably suffering from a condition such as arthritis, liver disease, kidney failure, or even cancer. Compounding the problem is the diffi- culty of accurately identifying the under- lying causes of many skin-related disor- ders—the list of possible causes is almost unlimited. As a result, many convention- al therapies amount to nothing more than relief of surface symptoms. In conventional veterinary medicine, skin problems are most often treated as conditions occurring on the outside of the body, and a common course of ther- apy typically involves topical creams, salves, rinses, or shampoos. When these external measures fail, corticosteroids, antihistamines, or other drugs are usually prescribed to depress the immune sys- tem and thereby squelch the uncomfort- able symptoms. While this approach to skin disease can ease an animal’s discom- fort quickly or even make the disease appear to go away, the underlying causes An Herbal Repertory for Animals 283 of the disease may never be considered, much less acted upon. As a result, they may progress to other, more serious problems. In human dermatology, eczema or psoriasis present excellent examples. Both are viewed by Western medicine as symptomatic manifestations of various systemic or external causes such as hormonal imbalances; systemic dysfunction; or viral, fungal, or bacterial infection; but the reasons the body allows such problems to occur remain largely unknown. In the absence of cura- tive answers, only the symptoms are addressed. The principles of holistic herbal medi- cine do not allow healers to employ solu- tions that address only the surface mani- festations of disease. While it’s true that finding a cure for chronic skin disorders is as difficult for holistic healers as it is for conventional research scientists, we are gifted with a special weapon: a holistic perspective that enables us to help the body find a cure for itself. The holistic herbal approach to skin disease reaches beyond symptoms to accept the fact that the body has mysterious but powerful abilities to heal itself. Fully understanding these abilities is not absolutely necessary. The function of the herbalist is not to substitute the body’s natural methods of treating disease with new methods but to assist the body in healing itself natural- ly. This applies to all forms of skin disease. Whether the problem is a contact der- matitis that can be quickly relieved with an application of herbal salve or a more complex condition that emanates from within the body to create chronic sebor- rhea, the approach is to assist the body’s efforts to heal while trying to identify and address the underlying causes. Writing comprehensively on herbal approaches to animal skin problems would entail writing an entire book—per- haps even multiple volumes. So instead we present some generalized herbal treatments with strong emphases on the holistic principles by which they are most effectively applied, for a few of the most common skin problems in companion animals. SKIN PROBLEMS OF INTERNAL ORIGIN Chronic, or recurring, skin conditions that cannot be attributed to elements outside the body usually indicate sys- temic disease. Generally speaking, if an animal’s body system cannot effectively eliminate waste or if foreign bodies or toxins cannot be effectively dealt with by a strong immune system, the body tries to push the problem outward, away from the vital organs. When the body resorts to such measures, it is usually because one or more of the organs or body sys- tems that monitor and respond to for- eign bodies and systemic waste have somehow become dysfunctional. The liver, kidneys, and immune and lymph systems become overburdened, the skin is asked to take actions it cannot take, and a “skin problem” erupts in the form of an oily, flaky coat; irritated, itchy skin; subcutaneous cysts; excessive hair loss; pus-filled eruptions, and so forth. Treating skin conditions that are sec- ondary to systemic disorders is difficult. Persistent skin conditions such as sebor- rhea (dry or greasy, flaky or scaly skin) or pyoderma (pus-filled eruptions) may be attributable to any number of deep-seat- ed factors, including dietary deficiencies, food or environmental allergies, immune system disease, or a microbial infection that may or may not be evident upon analysis of the skin itself. In such cases, the entire system must be evaluated, sys- temic deficiencies must be identified and corrected, and the search for direct caus- es must continue throughout the thera- py, even if the symptoms are under con- Herbs for Pets 284 trol. The golden rule to remember is this: The outward symptoms of many types of chronic skin disease represent only a small part of the holistic picture. We can- not expect to find curative solutions unless we focus our efforts beyond the symptoms to identify and address the underlying causes. This rule applies to all forms of skin disease, from an allergic response to fleabites to chronic hair loss. SKIN PROBLEMS OF EXTERNAL ORIGIN Skin problems that are triggered from outside the body are often, but not always, easier to identify and quicker to correct than those that emanate from within. For example, the cause of recur- rent urticaria (an inflammation of the skin surface characterized by small, itching welts) may be quickly identified and eliminated when it is discovered that Rover has been sleeping in a patch of stinging nettles growing along the back- yard fence. In this case, the holistic approach might be to neutralize the stinging acids with a dandelion flower or nettle tea rinse. A problem such as der- matophytosis, or ringworm, a parasitic fungal infection of the skin in dogs, cats, horses, and many other animals (includ- ing humans), presents the holistic care- giver with a more complex scenario. Ringworm is passed directly from an infected environment to the animal host. And like most parasites, including fleas and various skin-burrowing mites (sar- coptic mange, barn itch, demodectic mange, to name a few), ringworm is more likely to infect diseased or immuno- compromised animals than those with healthy disease resistance. Therefore, to holistically treat an animal suffering from ringworm, we must take the animal’s environment and his general state of health into consideration. Ringworm can be largely prevented by keeping the liv- ing environment clean, but infection must also be discouraged by maintaining the health of the potential host. This brings us right back to our main point: Before other causative factors can be addressed, the overall health of the individual must be fully evaluated and supported. HOLISTIC APPROACHES It’s important to keep in mind that herbs alone are seldom curative solutions to chronic forms of disease. In holistic med- icine, most skin problems are viewed as indicators of systemic dysfunction within the body. Rather than working in ways that exclude natural body functions (as many drugs do) to suppress the symp- toms of disease, herbs serve best as func- tional adjuncts to a variety of other cor- rective measures. Nutrition; the animal’s age; his physical, psychological, and neu- rological conditions; genetic predisposi- tions characteristic to his breed; and the quality of his living environment must be taken into account as equal parts of a holistic health picture. Feeding the Skin Your effectiveness at treating conditions such as flaky skin and a dull coat is gauged by how deeply you are willing to look into your animal’s whole body, lifestyle, and environment. To begin the healing process, some careful measures must be taken to assure that the skin is properly fed. Start with a critical assess- ment of your companion’s diet, looking not just at the diversity and types of food ingredients but at the quality of each ingredient as well. The skin is an organ that must continually regenerate itself to survive the constant effects of aging and bombardment from environmental ele- ments. To do so it must receive a unique array of special nutrients and nutritional adjuncts, many of which will not be An Herbal Repertory for Animals 285 found in a typical commercial diet. At the top of this special-requirement list are antioxidant vitamins (A, C, and E), miner- als, proteins, and especially EFAs, which can be administered to an animal through supplementing his diet. Essential fatty acid supplements might include flaxseed powder or oil, fish oil, or wheat germ oil. Vitamins A, C, and E are needed for their regenerative and antioxi- dant effects, and digestive enzymes are also required. In terms of herbs, horsetail and gotu kola may help regenerate and strengthen skin structure; and nutritive herbs such as spirulina, nettle, alfalfa, and red clover can provide trace minerals and antioxidant vitamins. Fresh burdock root is available at many health food stores and can be grated (raw) directly into your ani- mal’s food. Burdock is considered a specif- ic alterative for chronic skin problems. It is safe and nutritious and gently supports an animal’s liver and gallbladder. Feed your animal as much as he likes. The quality of protein you are feeding also plays a vital role here—low-grade pro- teins (such as soy-based fillers and most meat by-products) are difficult for animals to metabolize, and instead of being received as nutritive protein, they are treated as hard-to-eliminate wastes. By feeding your animal a diversity of high- quality, fresh foods and the proper nutri- tional supplements, you are equipping him with the components he needs to maintain healthy skin. Without the proper nutritional components, the skin becomes weak and vulnerable to the effects of the environment, its related body functions become compromised, and the entire sys- tem falls out of holistic balance. Piecing Together a Puzzle Once you are sure that your companion is getting the nutritional components needed for healthy skin and coat, consid- er the potential sources of any chronic problem. Does your animal have a food allergy? This can often be determined by removing food ingredients from the diet one at a time. For a dog or cat, start by changing the type of meat your animal is eating—especially if he is eating beef or a food that is made from mostly one type of meat. Next, try weeding out grains and yeast one at a time. Start by eliminat- ing soy, then try wheat, then yeast. While you are ruling out food aller- gies, also consider anything else that may be compromising your companion’s immune system. It is the immune sys- tem’s job to react to invading microbes or harmful substances. If the system is compromised and cannot react correctly or effectively, it may overreact, causing an allergic response. Is your companion hypersensitive to fleabites? Is the animal subjected to fre- quent vaccinations (a major cause of many skin and immune system prob- lems, in our opinion), protracted antibi- otic therapies, or any environmental tox- ins that may be depressing or stimulating immune functions? Find out the answers. Any of these factors may contribute to a chronic skin problem. After you have an idea of what might be entering your companion’s body to trigger the problem, then start looking for telltale signs of which organs or body systems might be affected. Is your animal friend suffering from constipation or diar- rhea, and does his skin, coat, or breath smell bad? If so, the digestive system and liver probably need herbal support. Is the urine concentrated and strong smelling, or does it have blood in it? Are urinary infections or stones a problem? In these cases, you need to optimize urinary effi- ciency and perhaps relieve inflammation in the urinary tract and kidneys. It’s impossible to ask yourself too many questions when looking for clues to the causes of a chronic skin problem. Herbs for Pets 286 Just remember to conduct your investiga- tion throughout the body, focusing on the organs and systems responsible for elimination of waste: the liver, kidneys, gallbladder, stomach and intestines, immune system, and lymph system. If you’re having problems doing this your- self, ask your holistic vet for help. HERBAL THERAPIES Since most forms of skin disease are relat- ed to poor elimination of systemic waste or immune system deficiency, a great deal can be accomplished by supporting the liver, kidneys, lymphatic system, immune system, and digestive functions with herbs. You should begin tonic herbal therapy while you are trying to pinpoint the actual causes of disease. Using tonic herbs to gently support the body’s cleansing systems helps the body to heal itself. Oftentimes, tonic alterative herbs change the course of systemic dys- function, and the body regains its ability to deal with whatever was triggering the skin problem. In these cases, the animal’s body finds its own cure, even though you never identify a cause. The herbs of choice for treating skin problems are stimulatory tonics and alter- natives that can be used safely over a long period as daily dietary supplements. Burdock has long been regarded as a spe- cific alterative for treating chronic forms of dermatitis. Cleavers improves lymph circu- lation, thus helping to remove waste and toxins from body tissues. It is also a diuret- ic and is mildly astringent, so it reduces inflammation that may exist in the urinary tract while encouraging elimination. Dandelion (root and leaf) is diuretic and nutritive and serves as a safe and reliable liver stimulant. It increases bile production and gently stimulates the gallbladder and the kidneys to help improve digestion and aid in the elimination of both solid and urine-carried wastes. Red clover helps bur- dock work and adds antioxidant and immune supportive qualities to a broad spectrum of vitamins and minerals. It is generally considered to be a blood purifi- er because it helps improve blood struc- ture, which in turn allows for better trans- port of waste products and toxins from the body. Garlic offers immune system support, liver support, antimicrobial activ- ities, and antioxidant properties. All these herbs are ingredients in the following for- mula for skin problems. As the symptoms and mechanisms of a chronic skin problem become more defined, herbs can be used to provide added support to specific body systems in need. Herbs can also be used to relieve uncomfortable symptoms. The ingredi- ents of the Basic Support Formula (see box on page 287) can then be adjusted to suit special needs. For instance, for a dog suffering from seborrhea attributed to food-borne heavy metals (a condition your holistic vet must diagnose), a short- term regimen of yellow dock can be added to the formula to help to quickly eliminate toxic buildups of metals or chemicals in the body. For an animal with a skin disorder associated with chronic constipation, Oregon grape may be use- ful to quickly increase bile production from the liver and improve digestion and elimination of waste, while marshmallow may also benefit the animal by lubricat- ing the colon. When using herbs to relieve the symp- toms of disease, it’s important to keep your perspective holistic. Remember, symptoms are valuable evidence of what’s going on within an animal’s body—don’t suppress them unless you are finished using them to determine corrective measures for the underlying problem. For instance, if you use licorice to relieve your companion’s inflamed skin without improving his diet, the goal of finding a curative solution will never be reached. Dermatitis—a symp- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 287 BASIC SUPPORT FORMULA Combine the following: 2 parts burdock root 2 parts cleavers * 1 part dandelion, in equal proportions of root and leaf 1 part red clover (flowering tops) 1 part fresh organic garlic powder *Tincture, tea, or the pressed juice of the fresh herb must be used Flaxseed oil, evening primrose oil, borage seed oil, fish oil, or a prepared multi-EFA supplement should be fed to the animal with this formula. This formula can be used in several forms. A combination of the dried ingredi- ents (except cleavers) can be fed directly to an animal or sprinkled onto his food daily at a rate of 1 tablespoon per 40 pounds of the animal’s body weight. The cleavers has to be added in the form of a liquid preparation because it oxidizes quickly and loses its potency when dried. Therefore, 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) of a glycerin-based cleavers tincture or 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of strong cleavers tea should be fed in place of the dry herb for each 40 pounds of an animal’s body weight. For cats, ferrets, rabbits, birds, and other small animals, the dosage is pro- rated according to the animal’s estimated weight. A parrot, for example, needs only a few drops of the tincture each day. Another option that is particularly good for horses, goats, llamas, and other herbivores is to administer the Basic Support Formula as fresh herbs. For these large animals, a few heaping handfuls of the herb mix should suffice each day. For rabbits and other small vegetarians, 1⁄2 cup of the mixture can be fed. If the animal eats a portion of the serving and then stops, it might mean that he has received all he needs. Take the remainder away. Cats, dogs, and other carnivores can be fed a raw mixture too, but keep in mind that they may have problems swallowing the cleavers—especially if it is Galium aparine, the species most com- monly used for herbal medicine. Galium aparine has a clinging nature that caus- es it to stick in the throats of animals who are not accustomed to eating live weeds. While this situation is not life threatening, it can cause some gagging and coughing. You may choose to feed your animal a species of Galium that does not share this characteristic, such as Northern bedstraw (Galium boreale—a common weed), or a garden variety such as sweet woodruff, (Galium odoratum) which does not have a sticky nature. It’s important to remember that the intent of this formula is to assist organ functions and to optimize the body’s absorption of needed nutrients. Providing a high-quality, natural diet is therefore paramount. It’s also important to keep in mind that tonic herbs, being noninvasive, work only at the body’s natural pace. Therefore, a tonic herbal therapy may take several days or even weeks to show results. Be patient, and allow your companion’s body an opportunity to heal itself. tom—may be temporarily relieved with licorice, but the underlying causes can- not be addressed unless we look at the entire problem holistically. SEBORRHEA Seborrhea is a term that is widely used for any form of skin-related disease char- acterized by dry or greasy, inflamed or itchy skin. Seborrhea may stem from any number of possibilities. At the top of the list are poor food quality and nutritional deficiency, followed by flea- or food- related allergies, vaccinosis, and exces- sive antibiotic use. Bacterial, fungal, viral, or parasitic (mite) infection and immune system dysfunction are also possible causes. Conventional treatment of seborrhea typically begins with the use of medicat- ed shampoos and topical steroid and antibiotic preparations. In cases in which clinical diagnosis identifies skin infec- tions, these measures can bring quick relief, but they usually do not address the reasons the skin became infected in the first place. Antibiotic and corticosteroid therapies are often used in cases of sebor- rhea that do not respond to topical treat- ment. From a holistic standpoint however, such measures compound the situation by inducing their own levels of systemic imbalance. Antibiotic and steroid thera- pies may make the symptoms disappear, but the underlying cause continues to go unchecked; the disease may be pushed deeper into the body and result in a much more serious disorder. The holistic approach begins when we realize that seborrhea is not really a dis- ease itself but a term used for a variety of skin-related disorders. There is no stan- dard herbal treatment to use for every kind of seborrhea. All forms of chronic skin disease, however, have two things in com- mon: all are connected to diet and all are less likely to occur or progress in animals who have healthy waste elimination and strong immune systems. Diet should be critically evaluated and improved to optimize the animal’s resist- ance to disease. Supplemental EFAs (e.g., flaxseed), digestive enzymes, minerals, and vitamins (especially vitamins E, A, and C) should be provided, and the possibility of food allergies should be considered. Herbs for Pets 288 ASTRINGENT HEALING SKIN RINSE Combine the following: 1 part juniper or uva ursi leaf decoction* 1 part calendula flowers, steeped into a strong tea 1 part peppermint *See “Basics of Herbal Preparations” in chapter 1 for instructions on mak- ing a decoction Combine all ingredients, herb mate- rial and all, and allow the mixture to stand until cooled. Strain the cooled fluid through a sieve, then soak the animal’s skin and coat (avoid the eyes) with the solution. Let the ani- mal drip dry. If the animal insists on licking off the solution, you can use the rinse as a fomentation—wrap an old towel or cloth (preferably undyed and unbleached) around the affected body parts, then thoroughly soak the towel with the cooled solution. This prevents the animal from lick- ing off the solution and enables you to keep the solution on your com- panion animal for several hours. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 289 First make a decoction of the juniper or the uva ursi leaves. Strain the cooled fluid through a sieve. Pour the liquid over your animal’s skin and coat. If your animal licks the rinse off his skin, use the rinse as a fomentation instead. Herbs for Pets 290 At the same time you are adjusting diet, treatment should begin with herbs that offer tonic support to the immune system and all organs involved in food metabolism and waste elimination. The Basic Support Formula serves as a good starting point. The animal’s entire health history should be evaluated to find clues to possible causes. Animals who have been subjected to prolonged antibiotic therapies may respond well to immune- modulating herbs such as astragalus or echinacea. To relieve itching and inflammation on the surface of the body, herbs with astrin- gent and wound-healing properties are indicated. In dogs or cats with itchy skin that exhibits little or no change of appear- ance, a liberal application of oatmeal may be applied to affected areas—cook the oatmeal into a loose, wet consistency and allow it to cool before putting it on your animal. A peppermint or lavender skin rinse is another option to help relieve itch- ing. If the itching is associated with minor redness, a daily skin rinse of cooled chamomile, plantain, or calendula tea may bring relief. Completely soak the ani- mal with the tea and allow him to drip dry. If open scratches, scabs, or sores are visi- ble, try combining calendula and comfrey, with sage, bee balm, thyme, or yarrow tea in equal proportions. When cooled and used in a rinse, this mixture accelerates the healing process and helps inhibit bacterial infection. If your companion’s condition is severe—the skin is flaky and red and scratching or chewing is continuous— stronger astringents may be needed. A decoction of uva ursi, juniper leaf, or rose bark are strong astringents that should serve well here. When using strong astringents on animals, proceed with caution. Dogs, cats, rabbits, ferrets, and other small creatures have skin that is often quite sensitive. Before soaking your animal with a fluid that is intended to tighten the skin, test it first—put a small amount on a portion of the animal’s body to make sure that there will not be any adverse reaction. One example of a basic astringent skin rinse can be found in the box on page 288. Birds have especially tender skin, and rinses consisting of strong astringents should be avoided in most cases. Sage, ECHINACEA AND OREGON GRAPE CLAY POULTICE Combine the following: 4 oz green or bentonite clay (powder)* 1⁄2 oz echinacea tincture (alcohol based) 1⁄2 oz Oregon grape tincture (alcohol based) *Be sure to use only supplement- grade clay (available at health food stores) Thoroughly combine the three ingredients, adding just enough dis- tilled water to make a thick paste. Then apply the poultice to the affected areas and leave it on to dry, if possible. If licking, rolling, scratch- ing, or other attempts at removal are a problem, wrap the area with a cloth or a piece of gauze. Leftover poultice can be put into an airtight container and stored in the refriger- ator almost indefinitely. If it dries out, just add more water or tincture to soften it. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 291 bee balm, or peppermint tea often work well in a birdbath. (Sage may help elimi- nate mites as well as relieve itching.) Add a dilute concentration of the tea to a bowl of clean, chlorine-free water (just enough to tint the water) and place it in the cage. Most birds enjoy taking an occasional bath, especially if they’re itchy! If an established bacterial infection is evident (an area is swollen and red, and sores are discharging pus), internal doses of echinacea tincture can be coupled with external applications of echinacea and Oregon grape (or organically farmed goldenseal) powder, tincture, salve, or ointment at the sites of infection. This boosts immune system response to the infection while adding direct antibacterial intervention. Another effective option for treating isolated infections of the skin is an echinacea and Oregon grape clay poul- tice, which is discussed in detail below. In cases in which itching and inflam- mation are severe, internal doses of licorice may bring relief by boosting pro- duction of corticosteroids in the body and lending direct anti-inflammatory activities to the effort. But licorice may not be a good choice in chronic, perhaps inherited skin disorders that require continuous long-term treatment because of its possi- ble side effects. In these cases, herbal treatment is limited to nutritional support and topical relief measures. If the animal has a fever, a good possi- bility exists that the infection has moved into the body, meaning it’s time to call your veterinarian immediately. PYODERMA The term pyoderma refers to infections of the skin that are characterized by the presence of subsurface pus. Most often, pyoderma is caused by foreign bodies such as splinters, insect bites or stings, fleas, or mites that have entered the skin and caused infection. In these cases, basic first aid or antiparasitic measures usually solve the problem. But in cases where pyoderma is secondary to systemic disease or dysfunction, its presence may indicate a serious, even life-threatening, condition. The possible causes range from a minor nutritional deficiency or allergy to inherited or acquired metabolic dysfunc- tions, autoimmune disease or deficiency (including lupus, pemphigus, vasculitis), viral infection (including FeLV and FIV), hormonal imbalances, parasitic infections, long-term steroid therapies, and even can- cer. The potential seriousness of pyoder- ma-related illnesses is testament to the value and importance of requiring a full holistic examination of your companion, his diet, and his environment. Diet and nutrition, as you may have guessed, are the first factors to consider in treating any pyoderma-related disor- der of internal origin. Herbal therapies should start with tonic support. The Basic Support Formula (see page 287) offers a good start. In severe cases, perhaps where acnelike pustules erupt on the chin of a cat and begin to spread to other parts of the body, a safe but aggressive systemic detoxification therapy might be indicated. This might include diuretic herbs such as dandelion leaf; liver stimu- lants such as yellow dock, Oregon grape, and turmeric; and blood-cleansing alter- natives such as red clover and alfalfa. Liver-regenerating herbs such as milk thistle and licorice may be useful as well, especially in cases in which chemical- induced liver damage is a suspected cause. Marshmallow root may help to ease the movement of waste through the colon. Psyllium husks added to the ani- mal’s food as per the supplement manu- facturer’s directions may also assist with the passing of waste. In addition to supporting the liver, kidneys, and digestive system, it’s impor- tant to thoroughly evaluate and support Herbs for Pets 292 the animal’s immune system. Clinical blood and urine tests may be useful here, as will the experience of a holistic veteri- narian. If a determination is made that the immune system needs stimulation, echinacea or astragalus may prove bene- ficial. If immune deficiency is compound- ed by viral infection, liver damage, or inflammation, licorice may serve as a use- ful adjunct. It’s important to note, howev- er, that immune system stimulation may not always be a good idea in the treat- ment of autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system is working against itself, such as with lupus erythe- matosus. Again, you are advised to con- sult your veterinarian before proceeding. External discomforts can be relieved with the same astringent and anti-inflam- matory herbs that are used for seborrhea. Aloe gel or a plantain or chickweed poul- tice may bring soothing relief as well. For cases in which pyoderma is limited to just a few isolated areas of the body, an herb- clay poultice can be especially effective at relieving itching, inhibiting bacteria and fungi, and pulling infection toward the surface of the body. When applied to the skin, the green or bentonite clay used for the poultice (or paste) naturally pulls fluid and waste products toward itself, while lending its own itch-relieving astringent activities and a diversity of mineral nutri- ents to the skin. As pathogenic microbes are drawn toward the clay, they are con- fronted with antimicrobial herb con- stituents that inhibit their reproduction. This clay poultice is an excellent first aid remedy for venomous and nonven- omous bites and stings as well. Be aware that the bentonite clay sold at hardware and feed stores often contains harmful bacteria and other impurities. Alcohol tinctures are preferable to glycerin because they add astringency to the for- mula and serve as preservatives in a poul- tice that is saved for future use. CONTACT DERMATITIS Contact dermatitis is caused when an irritating substance, organism, or aller- gen contacts or damages the outer sur- face of the skin. The onset of symptoms can be immediate or delayed for hours or even days. Contact dermatitis can appear in many forms—from what appears to be a hot, pink-flushed spot of skin to raised wheals, blisters, and ulcers that cover the animal’s body. In dogs and cats, the most common form of contact dermatitis occurs as the result of fleabites. Treatment in these cases begins with examining why the animal is so hypersensitive to the bites and then continues by working to make the environments of these pesky critters less hospitable. Symptomatic relief can be provided by applying astringent skin rinses (see “Seborrhea”). A skin rinse of grindelia is considered a specific remedy for dermati- tis caused by contact with poison ivy or poison oak. Jewelweed (Impatiens capen- sis), a plant native to eastern and central North America, has also been long regarded as a remedy for poison ivy. The tea of this herb is taken internally by humans, but its safety and effectiveness in animals are unknown. Alterative and diuretic herbs such as burdock root and dandelion leaf may be fed in tea or whole form to help the body eliminate anti- genic compounds that may be contribut- ing to the itch and inflammation. SEBACEOUS CYSTS Sebaceous cysts are lesions involving the ducts leading from sebaceous glands to their associated hair follicles. They are generally caused by obstruction of the ducts and appear as semisolid, freely moving lumps beneath the skin. A natural raw food diet is the best pre- vention. If an animal does get a seba- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 293 A SYSTEMIC DETOXIFYING FORMULA FOR DOGS, CATS, HORSES, AND GOATS Combine the following: 2 parts dandelion leaf 2 parts yellow dock root 2 parts red clover 1 part licorice root 2 parts marshmallow For dogs and cats, a glycerin-based tincture is the best form of application for this detoxifying formula. Yellow dock is bitter, and the sweet flavor of vegetable glyc- erin aids in administration. Feeding about 1⁄4 teaspoon (1 milliliter) of the com- bined tincture twice daily for each 20 pounds of an animal’s body weight is usual- ly sufficient to stimulate elimination. For best results, feed the tincture directly into the animal’s mouth. If this isn’t possible, try diluting the tincture with water. As a last resort, add it to the animal’s food. This formula should not be used continuous- ly for more than seven days. Horses, goats, sheep, llamas, and other large herbivores can be fed this formu- la in fresh or dried, whole-herb form—if they’ll eat it. Horses will probably need 3–6 cups of the herbs each day, whereas goats, sheep, and llamas may need only 11⁄2–3 cups. If direct feeding is not possible, try feeding everything but the yellow dock, then administer this bitter herb later in the form of tincture (prorate the tincture’s dosage to the amount the animal would receive in the formula). The idea behind this detoxifying formula is to stimulate gentle elimination of waste from the liver and digestive organs, not to drain your animal. If vomiting occurs, discontinue use immediately. Stools should be soft but not watery and gushing on passage. Likewise, the animal should not show any signs of gastric dis- comfort such as griping, distention, or odd sounds coming from the stomach. If this occurs, reduce the dose by one-half or discontinue use—the digestive system is stimulated enough and a different approach is warranted. On the other hand, if your animal has been constipated and is not finding relief from this formula, then the dosage can be increased in increments of 10 percent per feeding until stools appear soft or until the equivalent of one and one-half times the original dose is reached. After that, if results are not seen within two days, discontinue use—this formula is probably not going to work for your animal. This detoxifying formula should not be given continuously for more than ten days without the supervision of a qualified practitioner. It should not be used in pregnant animals or in those with a history of urinary stones or preexisting kidney disease. All of this is because of the oxalic acid contained in yellow dock. When used over a long period of time, oxalic acid can be irritating to the urinary system, and it may contribute to the formation of kidney or bladder stones. Herbs for Pets 294 ceous cyst, administering some herbs that help the body eliminate more easily might be in order. Herbs that assist lym- phatic drainage, such as cleavers, red clover, calendula, and burdock may help. Urinary Problems You may notice that your companion is drinking more and urinating less, urinat- ing in unusual places, or straining while urinating. Blood or other discharge may be visible in the urine, redness and inflammation may be evident at or around the animal’s urethra, or urine may be dark or especially odorous. If dis- comfort is evident when the lower abdomen or the area immediately behind the rib cage is gently palpated with fingertips, your companion may have an infection or inflammation of the bladder or kidneys. While these are all physical signs of a urinary tract disorder, holistic care of an animal’s urinary system requires a level of attentiveness beyond mere recognition of such symptoms. The urinary system is a delicately bal- anced arrangement of organs and body chemistries that serve a critical purpose of eliminating potentially toxic com- pounds from the body. The elimination process begins with the kidneys, which are responsible for separating waste material from the blood and delivering it via the ureters to the bladder. The blad- der then holds the urine until it is released from the body via the urethra. This system sounds simple but is actually complex when we consider the special nutritive, chemical, and structural requirements of the individual organs. The kidneys are fragile, oxygen-depend- ent organs with a low tolerance to stress. They work in concert with the digestive tract, liver, and circulatory system, and they are easily damaged if the relation- ships between these systems become compromised. For instance, if the liver is deficient in its job of removing dietary and systemic waste via the digestive tract, the kidneys and urinary tract suffer from the stress of handling waste prod- ucts that they are not designed to han- dle. The result can be kidney failure, stones, inflammation, or infection. Adding to the holistic complexity of this system is the fact that it is largely made up of smooth-muscle structures, unique vascular arrangements, and mucous membranes that require a special diversi- ty of nutrients and precise chemical bal- ances to remain healthy and functional. The most effective way to treat or pre- vent urinary system illness is to recognize your animal’s needs before physical symptoms of disease are obvious. Sometimes our companions have strange ways of telling us that they don’t feel well. They may start spraying the wall or our favorite clothes. Such behavior may be related to an emotional problem, but it may also mean that our friends are try- ing to tell us that something is seriously wrong physically. Don’t ignore or write off sudden bad behavior as neurosis—the situation could be quite serious. Effective holistic treatment of uri- nary disease starts with a critical assessment of the animal’s diet. Usually infection, stones, or kidney fail- ure is the progressive result of a nutri- tional excess, deficiency, or metabolic imbalance. It’s well known among clini- cians and researchers that animals who receive a balanced natural diet seldom suf- fer from urinary system ailments. When using herbs to treat urinary problems, teas and tinctures are the best forms of preparation. The goal is to get the active constituents of a plant into the urine, and the best way to do this is to bypass as much of the diges- tive system as possible with a liquid solution fed on an empty stomach. Following are some of the more com- An Herbal Repertory for Animals 295 mon treatments for urinary ailments we face as animal caregivers. BLADDER AND KIDNEY STONES (UROLITHIASIS) Like most forms of urinary disease, stones (sometimes called gravel or crystals) are the by-products of metabolic dysfunction or poor diet. They are associated with the body’s inability to effectively metabolize calcium, magnesium, ammonium, or other minerals. Many of the minerals that form stones are essential nutrients in a balanced diet, but they must be received by a healthy balanced body in a readily usable form. It’s important to know that excess minerals that the body cannot use must be eliminated through the digestive and urinary tracts. Stones are formed when urine pH levels or other chemical factors cause the minerals to bind and form crystals, which in turn build upon each other to create solid structures known as uroliths. Uroliths are most likely to occur in the bladder, but they sometimes form in the kidneys. Exposure to cadmium is also known to increase the formation of stones. The most common source of cadmium exposure for animals is ciga- rette smoke. To remain clean and free of harmful bacteria, the urinary tract must continu- ally flush itself. If an animal’s urethra is blocked by one or more uroliths, uremia, a potentially life-threatening condition, can result. If a ureter is blocked, kidney damage may occur and progress quickly after the onset of symptoms. Even if the animal’s condition appears stable and nonprogressive, urolithiasis creates an environment in the urinary system in which impeded waste elimination may lead to infectious growth of harmful bac- teria and fungi. Urolithiasis is especially common in cats, but dogs and other ani- mals may suffer from stones as well. Balanced nutrition is paramount in the effective treatment and prevention of uri- nary stones. A positive change in diet often equates to a long-term cure. Many types of urinary stones dissolve when urine chem- istry is corrected through a change of diet. However, some types of stones such as cal- cium oxalate uroliths must either be elimi- nated through the urethra via urination (an often long and painful process) or be sur- gically removed (depending on the size and number of the stones). The holistic herbal approach toward urinary system infection or stones must always start with a thorough dietary eval- uation. After that, the primary objectives are to assist the body in eliminating the stones, to help moderate urine pH (which is normally slightly acidic) with diuretic and demulcent herbs, and to inhibit infection and reduce the painful inflammation that makes urination diffi- cult by treating with with antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory herbs. Marshmallow has many qualities that make it a first-choice herb for treat- ing kidney and bladder stones. Herbs for Pets 296 In all cases (whether the stones are in the kidneys or the bladder), our approach begins with a thick, alcohol- free liquid preparation of marshmallow. The slippery oily mucilage of a cooled marshmallow tea or glycerite provides a protective lubricating barrier on swollen mucous membranes, thus assisting with the passage of stones. Marshmallow also has mild astringent qualities and antimi- crobial properties that join to reduce inflammation and help inhibit bacterial growth in the healing process. Plantain serves similar purposes but is less mucilaginous than marshmallow and has a slightly higher astringency. This makes it appropriate in cases in which the ure- thral inflammation from the passage of gravel is causing pain and strain during urination. Gravel root is another tradi- tional option worth considering. In cases in which minor urinary bleed- ing is present and bladder or kidney inflammation persists, couch grass and corn silk serve as good anti-inflammato- ries. If significant bleeding is occurring in the bladder but clinical evaluation has determined that kidney function remains strong and kidney inflammation is not evident, stronger hemostatic and astrin- gent herbs such as horsetail, uva ursi, and yarrow can be added to marshmallow to help stop the hemorrhage. If the kidneys are inflamed, however, these herbs may be contraindicated, and couch grass or shepherd’s purse make better options. Diuretic herbs such as dandelion leaf and cleavers are indicated in cases in which urination has not been severely obstructed because they help to dilute the urine and assist the body in its efforts to flush stones and bacteria out of the urinary tract. Keep in mind that if urina- tion is obstructed, strong diuretics may compound the situation because the increased urine volume may cause added pressure upon the kidneys. If urine backs up into the kidneys, a life-threatening infection can result. See your veterinarian immediately. Antimicrobial herbs should be used as a preventive measure against infection, especially in circumstances in which uri- nation is inhibited. Echinacea serves this purpose well. Oregon grape or certified organic goldenseal is useful for fighting bacteria and serve as effective anti- inflammatory agents in the bladder as well. If overly acidic urine is part of the problem, mullein leaf tea may help bring pH levels back toward normal. Mullein leaf also has diuretic and antimicrobial properties. URINARY SYSTEM INFECTIONS (CYSTITIS) Bacterial infection of the urinary tract is the most common infectious disease of dogs. At least 10 percent of all dogs seen by veterinarians for any reason have a uri- nary tract infection. Symptoms may include fever, lethargy, backache, painful urination (dysuria), frequent urination, and blood in the urine (hematuria). Causes are varied, but from a holistic per- spective the underlying question is always the same: Why was the animal’s body unable to effectively ward off the infection in the first place? In many cases, this question leads us back to diet, but other causes include immunological deficiency or bacterial, fungal, or protozoan infection from bad water or food. Bladder stones, injury, or tumors may also be contributing factors. In all cases, the focus of symptomatic herbal treatment is fundamentally the same—to assist the body at repelling the infection-causing entities, relieve inflam- mation and discomfort, dilute urine, and encourage urination. Urinary tract infections may be caused by various forms of bacteria, fungi, or parasites that have entered the body An Herbal Repertory for Animals 297 through the mouth or urethra. Feline lower urinary tract disease, or FLUTD (formerly known as feline urinary syn- drome, or FUS), is a nonspecific inflam- matory problem that occurs in the blad- der and urethra of cats. It is a chronic form of cystitis characterized by high pH (excessively alkaline) urine. Tiny, sharp- edged, struvite crystals form in the lower urinary tract and adhere to the walls of the bladder and urethra, causing inflam- mation and blockage. If left unchecked, they can develop into larger stones and cause severe and obstructive inflammato- ry disease of the entire urinary system. A cat with FLUTD has an urge to urinate frequently, but because urine output is greatly diminished by inflammation and accumulated crystals, he may be able to force out only a few drops at a time. This is a very dangerous situation—if urine backs up in the ureters and into the kid- neys, irreversible kidney damage can result quickly. Diet must be closely scrutinized as a primary cause of FLUTD. Because cats are carnivores, they should receive a large part of their daily water intake in the form of juicy raw meat. The process of metabolizing raw meat is essential to the maintenance of healthy feline urine pH levels. When cats must subsist on a dry- food diet, their systems must perform metabolic tasks that are beyond their natural design. Urine pH levels may become severely imbalanced, setting the stage for stone formation and bacterial reproduction. In fact, studies conducted at Cornell University strongly suggest that free-feeding dry foods may predis- pose cats to FUS. We along with a large percentage of veterinarians agree. Also, setting mealtimes is better than free- feeding. A cat or dog who is able to snack and nibble all day long is more like- ly to get a urinary infection, especially if the food is out of a bag or can. The best advice for preventing FLUTD is this: If for whatever reason you cannot feed a raw food diet to your cat, avoid dry kibble and feed a premium-quality, all-natural canned food to prevent your cat from developing urinary problems. If your feline friend is already suffering from FLUTD, adjust or change his diet and take him to a vet to determine whether his kidneys have been compromised. If they haven’t, the problem can be sympto- matically approached as a case of cystitis with astringent anti-inflammatory herbs such as uva ursi or pipsissewa combined with the soothing mucilaginous proper- ties of marshmallow and the disinfectant qualities of echinacea, garlic, Oregon grape, or yarrow. If kidney involvement is evident, herbs with high concentrations of tannins or strong volatile oils should be avoided. In such cases, corn silk, couch grass, plantain, nettle, shepherd’s purse, or raspberry leaf serves as a safer astringent. Some people and animals find relief from cystitis with cranberry juice or cran- berry powder (emptied from capsules) mixed in their food. Cranberry helps keep bacteria from adhering to the walls of the urethra and bladder. But research has found that cranberry juice is effective only at preventing bladder infections, not curing them. In one study, drinking 4–6 ounces of a commercial cranberry juice daily significantly prevented infections in a nursing home population. Another study used doses ranging from 5 to 20 ounces a day (in humans), so for dogs or cats, an ounce or so of cranberry juice or 1⁄4 teaspoon of the powder should serve as a nutritious, vitamin C–rich preventive measure against infection. The symptomatic herbal approach to any form of urinary system infection cen- ters on the use of herbs that directly inhibit reproduction of the invading microbes. In most cases, Oregon grape, Herbs for Pets 298 uva ursi, garlic, raspberry leaf, or echi- nacea serves this purpose well. But always look at the whole health picture and never stop asking yourself why the infection occurred in the first place. For example, animals with chronic gingivitis sometimes develop serious kidney infec- tions as a progressive result of a bacterial imbalance that originated from poor dental health or immune system deficien- cy. Again we are brought back to diet. In carnivores, raw bones serve to keep the teeth clean and the gums healthy; in her- bivores, it’s raw, fiber-rich vegetables. The point is this: if your companion is suf- fering from a urinary infection, don’t expect to find a long-term solution exclu- sively through the use of herbs. A holistic caregiver must look deeper than the symptoms to find and eliminate the root causes of disease. See the box on this page for a useful preparation for urinary system infection and stones. KIDNEY FAILURE Given the fragility of the kidneys and the extraordinary amount of hard work they do, it’s easy to understand why they are often the first body structures to wear out in the later years of an animal’s life. However, an alarming percentage of young and middle-aged animals suc- cumb to kidney failure as well. Kidney failure is often caused and is always compounded by a poor-quality or unbalanced diet. One contributing factor is the overabundance of phosphorus in many commercial brands of dog and cat food. Some brands contain five to nine times the required amount. While excess phosphorus is seldom an issue for ani- mals with strong, healthy kidneys, it can be problematic to animals with preexist- ing kidney damage, especially if they are receiving a diet that does not contain a necessary balance of readily usable calci- A BASIC FORMULA FOR URINARY INFECTIONS AND STONES* Make a strong tea or combine low- alcohol tinctures of the following ingredients. If possible, administer the formula on an empty stomach, and encourage your companion to drink plenty of water. 3 parts marshmallow root 1 part couch grass 1 part nettle 1 part echinacea 1 part Oregon grape *This formula helps to soothe, lubricate, and reduce inflamma- tion of urinary tract tissues, thus helping with the elimination of stones. The echinacea and Oregon grape help to reduce or prevent infection. For dogs, feed 1 teaspoon (5 milli- liters) of the cooled tea, twice daily, for each 30 pounds of body weight. Or feed 1–2 milliliters of the low-alcohol combination tinc- ture twice daily. For cats, feed 1⁄2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of the cooled tea, twice daily, for each 30 pounds of body weight. Or feed 0.5–1 milliliter of the low-alcohol tincture twice daily. Horses and other large animals can be given 200 milliliters of the cooled tea, fed twice daily with a turkey baster or similar device. Or you can give 20–30 milliliters of the low-alcohol tincture twice daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 299 um. In these cases, the kidneys may not be able to effectively eliminate the phos- phorus, which then accumulates in the kidneys and results in the eventual forma- tion of stones or degeneration of kidney tissues. A variety of other problems, such as diabetes, immune system dysfunction, long-term drug therapies, vaccinosis, chronic liver disease, and digestive prob- lems, often develop as the kidney dam- age progresses. The worst part of this grim picture is that the entire degenera- tive process can remain undetected until the damage has progressed into an irre- versible state of disease. Pinpointing the exact causes of kid- ney failure can be difficult. The kidneys are fragile and slow to heal, and in cases of progressive kidney degenera- tion, time is of the essence. Therefore, holistic treatment of kidney failure must begin with preventive dietary measures. If it’s too late for preventive measures, the problem is best approached as early as possible. If your companion is urinating exces- sively, drinking a lot of water, or has suf- fered from one or more urinary tract infec- tions or a bout with stones, take him to a holistic veterinarian for a thorough exami- nation. If kidney damage is found, chances are your companion will be placed on a reduced-protein, natural-food diet that is designed to moderate urine pH levels. This helps alleviate some of the kidney’s work- load, allowing the body to direct more energy toward the healing process. Herbal therapy can then commence with tonic herbs that improve renal blood circulation (ginkgo, hawthorn), reduce inflammation of nephritic (kidney) and other urinary tract tissues (couch grass, marshmallow, corn silk), and gently increase urine output (nettle, dandelion, alfalfa, goldenrod). If infection is part of the problem, nonirritat- ing antimicrobials (Oregon grape, gold- enseal) can be added as well. But extra care must be taken to assure that the herbal therapy does not further irritate the animal’s condition. Avoid herbs that con- tain large amounts of aromatic volatile oils (juniper, yarrow, members of the mint family) and those with considerable amounts of tannins (uva ursi, white oak bark, black walnut hulls), especially if the kidneys are inflamed. Most traditional herbal approaches to kidney failure are centered on increasing A BASIC HERB FORMULA FOR EARLY STAGES OF KIDNEY FAILURE Combine the tea or low-alcohol tinctures of the following: 1 part hawthorn 1 part ginkgo 1 part echinacea 1 part marshmallow 1 part dandelion leaf For dogs, a good starting dose is 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of the cooled tea or 1 milliliter of the com- bined tincture per 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily, preferably given between meals and with plenty of drinking water. For cats, start with 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of the cooled tea or 1 milliliter of the combined tincture, twice daily, preferably given between meals and with plenty of drinking water. Horses and large herbivores can receive 25 milliliters of the combined tincture diluted in 8 ounces (240 milliliters) or more of water, twice daily, preferably between meals. Herbs for Pets 300 diuresis (urine output) and decreasing inflammation. But we have found better success when equal attention is placed on improving blood circulation in the kidneys. A Holistic Herbal Approach to Kidney Failure: The Tilford Theory The fact that the kidneys are second only to the brain in terms of circulatory dependency is often overlooked when treating kidney failure. If the blood flow to the kidneys is blocked by damaged or inflamed tissue, the kidneys will die from lack of oxygen. We have received several reports from veterinarians and pet owners who have seen promising results in the treatment of early to midstage kidney failure in dogs and cats from use of a formula that combines anti-inflammatory, immunos- timulant, and, most important, circulato- ry tonic herbs. The theory behind this approach is that the kidneys are critically oxygen dependent and made up of hun- dreds of blood vessels. They are sensitive to blood-pressure disorders, vascular atony, and poor circulation. Through the use of hawthorn, increased renal circula- tion is achieved without elevating blood pressure. At the same time, ginkgo dilates and improves tonicity of nephritic blood vessels, improves blood return from the extremities, and helps reduce blood pressure in congested tissues. The mucilage content of ginkgo also serves to reduce inflammation throughout the uri- nary tract and provides a protective lubri- cating barrier for the passage of wastes. A small amount of garlic or echinacea helps keep bacteria and fungi in check, marsh- mallow helps soothe and reduce inflam- mation, and dandelion leaf or the fresh juice of parsley helps to increase urine output. Other herbs worth investigating in cases of kidney failure include alfalfa, astragalus, goldenrod, and couch grass. URINARY INCONTINENCE Urinary incontinence is fairly common in aging animals, spayed females (especially dogs), and in females who have lost blad- der tone as a result of multiple pregnan- cies. Urinary incontinence can also be triggered by nervous system dysfunction, emotional disorders, inflammatory dis- ease, or nutritional deficiency. Identifying the exact cause of urinary incontinence can be challenging, and successful herbal treatment usually depends on just how well the caregiver knows and understands his or her com- panion. Did the problem begin suddenly, or has there been an occasional drop or two of urine in your companion’s bed from time to time in the past? If the lat- ter is true, a gradual degeneration of bladder tone could have been reversed early on. Does your animal appear to be stiff after exercise, do her hind legs wob- ble when she stands after exercise, or A TONIC FORMULA FOR URINARY INCONTINENCE Combine the following: 1 part oatstraw 1 part plantain 1 part corn silk 1 part nettle root or saw palmetto 1 part horsetail We like to use this formula in the form of a glycerin tincture because it’s easy to administer, but a tea is equally effective. A good starting dose is 12–20 drops of the glycerite or 1 teaspoon of the strong tea for each 20 pounds of the animal’s body weight, twice daily. An Herbal Repertory for Animals 301 does she seem to be holding her rump lower when walking? If any of these are even slightly evident, then your compan- ion may be developing arthritis, hip dys- plasia, or some other cause of nerve impairment that may be affecting the tone and function of urinary tract mus- cles. This illustrates just how important a pet care diary can be. By keeping detailed notes about subtle changes in your animal’s appearance, behavior, feeding habits, and physical perform- ance, you can detect trends that point to early stages of disease and that greatly simplify finding curative solutions. In spayed females, normal hormone production is interrupted when the uterus and ovaries are removed during an ovariohysterectomy. The bladder is composed of smooth-muscle groups that are functionally interdependent with a balance of reproductive hormones, so when hormone production is altered, the bladder loses tone and urine dribble results. Reversing this kind of inconti- nence is difficult because there is no way that herbs can replace hormones that should be naturally produced by the body. Oatstraw and wild yam (Dioscorea villosa) contain estrogenic (phytoestro- gens) compounds. Theoretically, these herbs might help stimulate whatever hor- mone production is left intact, and to some extent they might mimic natural hormone production enough to serve as a partial remedy for incontinence. Although these herbs are safe in moder- ate doses, this approach is unreliable and may affect only certain animals. The bet- ter approach toward hormone-related urinary incontinence applies to all forms of urinary incontinence: strengthen and support the structure and function of the bladder sphincters and urinary smooth- muscle tissues with long-term use of tonic herbs. Choices include corn silk, raspberry leaf, horsetail, saw palmetto, nettle root, couch grass, uva ursi, agri- mony, marshmallow, and plantain. Oatstraw can also be included for the aforementioned purpose and as a nutri- tive diuretic. Urinary incontinence is sometimes caused by neurological disorders, espe- cially in older animals who suffer from senility and general debility. Oftentimes, epileptic animals have a problem with incontinence too. In these cases, we can look toward cerebrotonics such as ginkgo and gotu kola to help bring relief. These herbs work to improve synaptic (nerve impulse) transmission and blood circula- tion in the brain. Skullcap or valerian might help moderate brain activities that are believed to trigger epileptic episodes and may also be instrumental in treating incontinence of neurological origin. If emotional or behavioral disorders are part of the problem, Saint-John’s-wort might be indicated. 302 ——— A ——— abortifacient: a substance that can cause abortion acupoints: part of traditional Chinese medi- cine; points on the body that are sights where pressure is applied as in acupressure or needles are inserted under the skin as in acupuncture adaptogen: a nontoxic substance that is believed to increase stamina and overall energy levels in the body, especially in stressful conditions aerial parts: the aboveground portions of a plant allopathy (see homeopathy): the use of drugs or other means to antidote a disease or symptom in a manner not necessarily coopera- tive with the body’s natural functions. alterative: an herb or other agent that gradual- ly alters an existing condition in the body.

L'organisme des animaux atteints de diarrhée perd de l'eau et du sel. Ces animaux s'affaiblissent, ils maigrissent et peuvent mourir. La diarrhée est fréquente chez les jeunes animaux et en tue beaucoup. La constipation se manifeste quand l'animal ne peut pas déféquer ou ne le fait que difficilement. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Comment reconnaître la diarrhée et la constipation.2 Ce qui cause la diarrhée et la constipation.3 Ce qui caractérise la diarrhée chez les différents animaux.4 Comment traiter et combattre la diarrhée.5 Comment traiter la constipation. Comment reconnaître la diarrhée Les animaux souffrant de diarrhée évacuent des selles liquides (excréments) plusieurs fois par jour. Les selles sont liquides, elles dégagent une mauvaise odeur et leur couleur n'est pas normale. A cause du sang qu'elles contiennent, elles peuvent être vert foncé, brun foncé ou d'un noir rougeâtre. Dans certains cas, par exemple chez l'animal atteint de peste bovine, la diarrhée dégage une odeur nauséabonde. Les causes de diarrhée La diarrhée peut durer un ou deux jours puis cesser. Ce type de diarrhée a les origines suivantes: · L'animal n'a pas reçu le fourrage qui lui convient. · Le fourrage de l'animal a été brusquement modifié. · La distribution d'ensilage peut parfois causer la diarrhée. · Le fourrage était vieux, il pourrissait ou fermentait. · La diarrhée peut être due à des germes (la température du corps peut atteindre un niveau élevé). · L'infection due à des parasites peut causer une diarrhée qui contient parfois du sang. La diarrhée chez les ruminants Chez les bovins, les ovins, les caprins et les buffles, la diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Germes et parasites internes, surtout chez les jeunes animaux au pâturage. · Germes infectant les intestins des jeunes animaux (la température du corps n'est généralement pas élevée). · Suralimentation des veaux avec du lait en poudre de mauvaise qualité. Si les bovins ont à la fois la diarrhée et des lésions (anormales) de la bouche, vous devez demander conseil à votre vétérinaire. Chez les ovins et les caprins, la diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Infection par un germe (la température du corps peut atteindre un niveau élevé).· Présence de parasites internes chez les jeunes animaux au pâturage. Les jeunes animaux peuvent avoir la diarrhée après le sevrage. La diarrhée chez les chevaux La diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Infection par les germes (la température du corps est généralement élevée).· Antibiotiques ou médicaments administrés pour combattre une autre maladie.· Stress (l'animal est élevé dans de mauvaises conditions et perturbé).· Un poulain âgé d'une semaine peut avoir la diarrhée quand sa mère est en chaleur (œstrus). La diarrhée chez les porcs · La diarrhée chez le porc peut être causée par une infection due à des germes (la température du corps peut atteindre un niveau élevé) ou à des parasites internes. La diarrhée chez les chameaux La diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · De trop grandes quantités de fourrage vert frais peuvent provoquer une diarrhée verte. · L'infection par des parasites peut provoquer une diarrhée d'un brun foncé ou d'un rouge foncé. · Les chameaux mâles en rut peuvent avoir la diarrhée. La diarrhée chez les poulets et les canards · La diarrhée blanche des poulets est causée par un germe (une bactérie) qui est transmis par la poule au poussin. Chez les volailles adultes, cette maladie provoque une diarrhée d'un brun verdâtre, mais chez le poussin la diarrhée est de couleur blanche. · La diarrhée contenant du sang peut être provoquée par les petits parasites appelés coccidies (voir module 55) qui infectent l'intestin. La diarrhée chez les lapins Les crottes de lapin doivent être distinctes les unes des autres, rondes, assez fermes et d'un brun grisâtre. Tout changement est un signe de mauvaise santé. La diarrhée peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Remplacement d'un fourrage sec par un fourrage vert. · Nourriture défectueuse: trop humide, trop froide ou contaminée par des produits chimiques. · Maladie causée par des germes (la température du corps est généralement élevée). · Coccidies (elles peuvent causer la diarrhée chez les lapereaux). Traitement La diarrhée accompagnée de fièvre est causée par des germes. Si la diarrhée persiste plus de deux jours et si la température du corps a augmenté (voir module 4), vous devez demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire. L'animal peut être traité aux antibiotiques (voir R6, R7, annexe 1) ou aux sulfamides (voir R9, annexe 1). La diarrhée entraînera chez l'animal une perte d'eau et de sels; si on la laisse persister l'animal risque de mourir. Si vous ne pouvez pas obtenir l'aide du vétérinaire, vous pouvez administrer vous-même à l'animal un liquide de réhydratation. Pour confectionner du liquide de réhydratation, vous devez mélanger six cuillerées à café de sucre et une demi-cuillerée à café de sel dans 1 litre d'eau chaude propre. Administrez ce mélange (500 ml pour les ovins ou les caprins) sous forme de breuvage quatre fois par jour pendant trois jours. Les animaux de taille plus grande ont besoin de davantage de liquide: 5 pour cent du poids corporel deux fois par jour. Traitement Constipation Les animaux constipés ne peuvent pas déféquer ou bien ils évacuent des excréments très durs avec difficulté. Il est facile de déceler un animal atteint de constipation. La constipation est traitée par un lavement. On injecte dans le rectum de l'eau savonneuse chaude. Pour soulager la constipation, on peut administrer à l'animal par la bouche du sulfate de magnésie ou des huiles vendues dans le commerce (voir R22, annexe 1). ConstipationModule 69: Salivation et problèmes de la bouche La salive est produite par des glandes dans la bouche; elle aide à mastiquer et à avaler la nourriture. Une salivation excessive, avec de l'écume autour de la bouche, n'est pas normale. Une salivation excessive accompagnée de lésions de la bouche et de fièvre est un signe de maladie. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez pouvoir: 1 Reconnaître une salivation excessive.2 Reconnaître l'étouffement (nourriture bloquée dans l'œsophage).3 Identifier les différents types de lésions de la bouche.4 Reconnaître les aphtes dans la bouche.5 Traiter les problèmes concernant la bouche. Salivation excessive Une salivation excessive accompagnée de mouvements de mastication peut avoir plusieurs causes différentes. Ouvrez la bouche de l'animal et vérifiez ce qui cause le problème, à savoir: · Des corps étrangers (épines, clous, morceaux de nourriture) dans la bouche ou entre les dents. · Des problèmes dentaires et des abcès. · Une intoxication. · Des morceaux de nourriture bloqués dans l'œsophage et provoquant un étouffement. L'étouffement (nourriture bloquée dans l'œsophage) Cela se produit quand des morceaux de fourrage secs ou de grande taille sont bloqués dans l'œsophage. Cet incident est fréquent chez les bovins et peut se produire chez les chevaux. Il faut éliminer l'obstruction. L'étouffement chez les ruminants provoque la météorisation. La meilleure façon d'éliminer l'obstruction consiste à appuyer sur l'encolure de l'animal du côté gauche vers le haut et vers la bouche. Un autre moyen consiste à appuyer fortement sur le dessus de la bouche avec vos doigts pour obliger l'animal à l'ouvrir. Versez alors une petite quantité (10-20 ml) d'huile dans la bouche de l'animal ou introduisez une sonde gastrique dans l'œsophage (voir annexe 3). Salivation accompagnée de lésions de la bouche Parfois, un animal produit une salive excessive qui s'écoule de la bouche avec de l'écume. Cela est dû à une lésion dans la bouche, ou sur la langue ou les lèvres. Les lésions de la bouche peuvent avoir les aspects suivants: · Des taches rouges et des aphtes (ampoules remplies de sérosité) sont présents dans la bouche. · La peau de détache à certains endroits, laissant visible du tissu rouge. · La langue est tuméfiée. La salivation excessive, les lésions de la bouche et la fièvre sont des signes de maladie infectieuse. Vous devez demander à votre vétérinaire d'examiner immédiatement l'animal. La peste bovine et la fièvre aphteuse (voir module 25) provoquent une salivation excessive et des lésions de la bouche. Ces signes peuvent aussi être dus à d'autres maladies. Traitez les lésions de la bouche avec un antiseptique (voir R3, annexe 1). Votre vétérinaire recommandera peut-être des injections d'antibiotiques pendant plusieurs jours.Module 70: La fièvre Quand on vérifie l'Etat de santé d'un animal, il est important de connaître la température du corps. Utilisez votre thermomètre pour prendre la température du corps si vous soupçonnez un animal d'être malade. Si la température est supérieure à la normale (voir module 4), l'animal a de la fièvre. La fièvre est l'un des signes les plus courants d'une maladie infectieuse. On appelle fièvre bénigne une légère augmentation de la température du corps et forte fièvre une augmentation importante. Quand la température du corps est inférieure à la normale, l'Etat de l'animal pourrait être dû à la faim, à une hémorragie ou à une déshydratation. Comme la diarrhée, la fièvre entraîne pour l'animal une perte de beaucoup d'eau et de sels. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Quand un animal a de la fièvre.2 Ce qui cause la fièvre.3 Ce qu'il faut faire avec un animal qui a de la fièvre. La fièvre Vous devez savoir quel est l'aspect d'un animal sain (voir module 5). Si vous soupçonnez un animal d'être en mauvaise santé, parlez à son propriétaire pour en savoir le plus possible à son sujet. Examinez l'animal et utilisez votre thermomètre pour lui prendre sa température. Si la température du corps est supérieure à la normale, l'animal a de la fièvre. L'augmentation de la température vous indiquera à quel point l'animal a de la fièvre. La température normale du corps des ovins est de 39 °C. Si la température atteint 40 °C ou 41 °C, le mouton a une fièvre légère. Si la température se situe entre 41,5 °C et 42 °C, l'animal a une forte fièvre. Une température de 38 °C est inférieure à la normale. Chez tous les animaux, une augmentation de 1 °C ou 2 °C de la température du corps indique une fièvre bénigne, tandis que toute température supérieure de 2 °C à la normale indique une forte fièvre. L'origine de la fièvre La fièvre, en particulier une forte fièvre, est le résultat d'une maladie infectieuse causée par des germes (voir module 6). Quand certains types de germes pénètrent dans l'organisme d'un animal sain, il tombe malade. Les animaux peuvent prendre des germes pour les raisons suivantes: · Présence de germes dans l'atmosphère.· Eau sale et mauvais fourrage.· Logement de l'animal sale (déjections et urine non évacuées).· Lait, salive, urine ou sang provenant d'animaux malades.· Morsures de mouches et blessures. Le traitement de la fièvre Si un animal a de la fièvre, séparez-le des autres et placez-le à l'ombre dans un endroit frais, avec beaucoup d'eau fraîche et propre. Si l'animal a une fièvre bénigne mais aucun signe de diarrhée, de constipation, d'écoulement à l'œil ou à la bouche ni aucun autre indice de mauvaise santé, il faut lui donner un peu de bon fourrage. Surveillez-le pendant un ou deux jours pour voir si la fièvre baisse. Si l'animal a une forte fièvre et de la diarrhée, un écoulement ou d'autres signes de mauvaise santé, vous ne devez lui donner que de l'eau fraîche et propre, et obtenir si possible l'aide du vétérinaire. Si vous ne pouvez pas faire venir le vétérinaire pour un animal atteint d'une forte fièvre, vous pouvez administrer un antibiotique ou un sulfamide par injection ou par voie orale pendant au moins trois jours pour tuer les germes (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1). Surveillez bien l'animal pour déceler les signes d'amélioration pendant les deux journées qui suivent. Si l'animal ne retourne pas à la normale (pour ce qui est de l'alimentation, de la boisson et du mouvement), vous devez contacter le vétérinaire pour découvrir le problème et décider du moyen de le traiter.Module 71: Toux et problèmes de respiration La toux est une expiration forte et puissante par la bouche. L'éternuement est une expiration brève et forte par les naseaux. Les difficultés de respiration et la respiration très rapide sont d'autres problèmes de l'appareil respiratoire; ils traduisent un état anormal. Les problèmes de respiration accompagnés de fièvre et d'un écoulement aux naseaux signifient que l'animal a une infection. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Quand un animal a de la toux.2 Ce qu'est l'éternuement.3 Ce qu'est un écoulement aux naseaux.4 Comment traiter les animaux qui ont des problèmes respiratoires. La toux La toux est une expiration forte et puissante (voir module 3). Elle peut avoir les causes suivantes: · Maladies infectieuses des poumons ou de la trachée. · Parasites dans les poumons. · Liquide ou mucosités dans les poumons ou la trachée. · Pénétration d'un médicament liquide (breuvage) dans les poumons au lieu d'atteindre l'estomac en passant par l'œsophage. Les porcs peuvent tousser quand ils reçoivent des aliments poussiéreux. L'éternuement Un éternuement est une expiration forte et puissante par les naseaux. Il peut être causé par une infection à l'intérieur des naseaux ou par les larves de la mouche des naseaux (voir module 64). Difficultés de respiration L'animal éprouvera de la difficulté à respirer s'il a une infection des poumons ou de la trachée. La respiration sera bruyante. Une obstruction de la trachée par un corps étranger ou un abcès causera aussi des difficultés de respiration. Respiration rapide La respiration rapide est causée par une maladie infectieuse et elle est associée à de la fièvre. On la remarque aisément en observant les mouvements du poitrail quand l'animal respire. Traitement Si un animal tousse sans qu'il y ait d'écoulement aux naseaux ou un signe de fièvre, vous devez soupçonner la présence d'un corps étranger ou de poussières dans la trachée ou les poumons, ou encore une strongylose. Vérifiez s'il n'y pas de corps étranger ou, si c'est nécessaire, donnez à l'animal un traitement pour la strongylose (voir R11, R12, annexe 1). Une toux accompagnée de fièvre et d'un écoulement aux naseaux et aux yeux est causée par une infection. Vous devez demander l'aide du vétérinaire mais, s'il n'est pas possible de l'obtenir, vous pouvez administrer à l'animal des antibiotiques ou un sulfamide (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1) pendant au moins trois jours. L'éternuement en l'absence de fièvre est causé par la présence d'un corps étranger dans les naseaux ou de larves de la mouche des naseaux. Si un animal a un corps étranger ou un abcès dans la trachée, il éprouvera des difficultés à respirer mais il n'aura pas de fièvre.Module 72: Les problèmes oculaires Une lésion ou infection de l'œil ou une carence en vitamines (avitaminose) peuvent entraîner la cécité chez les animaux. Les animaux aveugles peuvent ne pas survivre parce qu'ils seront incapables de trouver de la nourriture. Un problème dans un seul œil résulte d'un traumatisme ou de la présence d'un corps étranger. Un problème dans les deux yeux accompagné de fièvre signifie que l'animal a une infection ou une maladie grave. Si l'animal est aveugle des deux yeux mais n'a pas de fièvre, vous devez soupçonner une avitaminose, par exemple une carence en vitamine A ou B. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez connaître: 1 La structure de l'œil de l'animal.2 Les causes des problèmes oculaires.3 Le traitement des problèmes oculaires. L'œil L'œil est important pour la survie de l'animal. La surface de l'œil qui ressemble à du verre est appelée cornée. L'œil peut être recouvert par les paupières qui le protègent. L'œil Les problèmes oculaires Si un œil est rouge, gonflé et larmoyant, cela peut être causé par: · Un corps étranger comme du sable, de la poussière ou une graine dans l'œil.· Une lésion ou coupure de la cornée.· Une infection oculaire causée par des mouches ou des souillures.. Si les deux yeux sont gonflés, rouges et larmoyants, et si éventuellement l'animal est incapable d'ouvrir les yeux, c'est un signe d'infection. Vous devez vérifier la température du corps pour voir si l'animal a de la fièvre. Beaucoup de maladies provoquent des problèmes oculaires. Les animaux aveugles Il est facile de repérer un animal aveugle parce qu'il heurte des objets en marchant. Il est difficile de garder un animal aveugle. Pour vérifier si un animal est aveugle, faites avec la main un mouvement rapide et menaçant vers la face de l'animal sans toucher celui-ci ni créer du vent qu'il pourrait sentir. Si l'animal ne cligne pas des yeux, c'est généralement le signe qu'il est aveugle. La vitamine A, qui est présente dans le fourrage vert, l'ensilage et le foin de bonne qualité, est importante pour conserver une bonne vision. Si les animaux ne reçoivent que du fourrage ancien et sec ou s'ils doivent paître dans des zones arides, ils acquièrent une héméralopie et ne voient plus au crépuscule ou la nuit. Traitement Pour traiter les problèmes oculaires: · Demandez à quelqu'un d'immobiliser l'animal s'il a un corps étranger (souillure ou sable) dans l'œil. · Avec des mains propres, et en utilisant le pouce et l'index, ouvrez les paupières et pressez doucement vers l'intérieur. · Utilisez un chiffon doux et propre pour retirer le corps étranger de l'œil. · Mettez une goutte d'huile ou de la pommade dans l'œil. Traitement Si vous éprouvez de la difficulté à enlever un corps étranger: · Déposez une goutte d'huile d'olive, de ricin ou de foie de morue dans l'œil; cela aidera à retirer les souillures. · Mettez un peu de sucre dans l'œil pour provoquer des larmes; elles évacueront le corps étranger. Utilisez un collyre ou une pommade pour soigner les yeux rouges et gonflés (voir R23, annexe 1). Traitement Si vous ne parvenez pas à ouvrir un œil gonflé, ne forcez pas les paupières à s'ouvrir. Vous devez rechercher l'aide du vétérinaire. Si les deux yeux sont gonflés, rouges et larmoyants et si l'animal a de la fièvre, mettez l'animal à l'ombre, à l'écart des autres. C'est là un signe de maladie infectieuse et il faudra peut-être traiter l'animal aux antibiotiques. On évite la carence en vitamines A et B, en distribuant aux animaux de l'ensilage ou du fourrage de complément pendant la saison sèche. En cas de carence, ces vitamines peuvent aussi être administrées par injection (voir R28, annexe 1).Module 73: Plaies et hémorragies Une plaie est une coupure ou déchirure de la peau. Toutes les plaies saignent, elles sont douloureuses et peuvent être infectées par des germes ou des larves. Parfois, un animal peut saigner par suite de plaies à l'intérieur du corps, qui ont été causées par des parasites, par un accident ou, chez la femelle, par des problèmes au moment de la mise bas. C'est ce qu'on appelle une hémorragie interne. Le sang transporte l'oxygène des poumons vers chaque partie de l'organisme. Si l'organisme perd trop de sang, il n'obtient pas assez d'oxygène et l'animal en meurt. Toutes les plaies doivent être nettoyées soigneusement et il faut faire cesser le saignement. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Quelles sont les causes des plaies.2 Comment soigner les plaies au départ.3 Comment faire cesser le saignement.4 Que faire en cas d'hémorragie interne.5. Comment traiter les plaies anciennes.6 Comment soigner les blessures du cordon ombilical et les lésions dues à la castration. Comment soigner les plaies au départ Les animaux peuvent être blessés par les cornes et les morsures d'autres animaux, ou par des épines ou des objets coupants comme le verre, le fil de fer et les clous. Ces blessures seront infectées par des germes à cause des conditions dans lesquelles vivent les animaux. Si la blessure ne saigne pas trop, nettoyez-la à l'eau salée en éliminant toutes les souillures. Eliminez en les coupant les poils ou la laine qui entourent la plaie. Si vous avez un désinfectant (R1, annexe 1), mettez-en sur la plaie. Une pulvérisation pourra aussi aider à maintenir la plaie propre (R5, R8, annexe 1). Saignement (hémorragie) On peut faire cesser le saignement des plaies, petites ou superficielles, en pressant fort dessus avec un linge propre. Si le linge est trempé par le sang, placez-en un autre par-dessus plutôt que d'enlever le premier. Quand le saignement a cessé, nettoyez la plaie et traitez-la. Vous aurez besoin de l'aide du vétérinaire quand l'hémorragie provient de blessures de grande taille ou profondes. Si vous ne pouvez pas faire cesser le saignement en pressant sur la plaie avec des linges, posez un garrot (un tourniquet). Un garrot est un morceau de corde ou de toile avec lequel on serre un vaisseau sanguin. Il ne peut être utilisé que pour les blessures aux pattes ou à la queue. Il ne faut pas poser un garrot autour de l'encolure. Saignement (hémorragie) Attachez la corde autour du membre blessé, au-dessus de la plaie. Pour la serrer, glissez un bâton sous la corde et tordez jusqu'à ce que cesse le saignement. Le tourniquet ne doit pas rester posé plus de 20 minutes. Relâchez-le lentement et, si c'est nécessaire, serrez-le de nouveau. Nettoyez et traitez la plaie quand le saignement a cessé. Hémorragie due à une cassure de corne Si la corne d'un animal est brisée, essayez de faire cesser le saignement en posant sur la plaie un tampon ou un linge propre et en le maintenant en place avec un bandage. Un tourniquet provisoire à la base de la corne fera cesser l'hémorragie. Si cela ne met pas fin à l'hémorragie, on peut placer un morceau de métal chauffé à blanc directement sur l'endroit qui saigne pendant 30 secondes pour cautériser la corne et le vaisseau sanguin. Il peut s'avérer nécessaire de procéder ainsi sur plusieurs endroits qui saignent sur la corne ou encore sur la peau qui entoure la corne. Hémorragie due à une cassure de corne N'oubliez pas qu'il ne faut pas laisser un garrot posé pendant longtemps. Si l'hémorragie continue, libérez le tourniquet toutes les 20 minutes, puis resserrez-le. Hémorragie interne Ce type de saignement est dangereux. Il peut provenir: · Des poumons et de l'intestin après un accident.· De l'utérus ou du vagin après la mise bas. Les signes d'hémorragie interne sont les suivants: l'animal s'affaiblit et la respiration devient plus rapide. Un animal atteint d'une hémorragie interne doit être placé dans un endroit tranquille et chaud, et il faut lui donner de l'eau contenant une pincée de sel. N'essayez pas de faire marcher l'animal car il pourrait s'effondrer et mourir. Si vous soupçonnez un animal d'avoir une hémorragie interne, vous devez demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire. Dans bien des cas, vous ne pourrez rien faire pour arrêter l'hémorragie. Il est préférable d'abattre l'animal. Chez la jument et l'ânesse, il peut y avoir une hémorragie interne du vagin après la mise bas. Si vous ne pouvez pas obtenir l'aide du vétérinaire, placez dans le vagin un tampon constitué par un linge ou une serviette propre que vous avez fait bouillir puis laissé refroidir. Laissez la serviette dans le vagin pendant un ou deux jours puis retirez-la. Blessures anciennes Si on laisse les plaies sans traitement, elles s'infestent de larves qui aggravent le mal. Dans certains cas, la gangrène se développe dans la plaie. La blessure empire et la plaie noircit en dégageant une odeur nauséabonde. Demandez immédiatement l'aide de votre vétérinaire. Plaies dues à des opérations Les plaies peuvent être causées par des opérations pratiquées sur l'animal, à savoir: · La castration.· Le tronçonnage (la queue est écourtée).· Le décornage (ablation de la corne).· La résection du cordon ombilical immédiatement après la naissance.· Des coupures lors de la tonte de la laine. Toutes les plaies doivent être nettoyées avec un désinfectant (voir R1, annexe 1). Si vous disposez d'une poudre pour les blessures (R5, R8, annexe 1), vous devez en mettre sur la plaie tous les jours jusqu'à ce qu'elle se cicatrise. Quand les blessures ou les plaies laissées par une opération s'infectent, elles gonflent souvent à cause du pus. La tuméfaction est molle au toucher. Il faut enlever le pus de ces plaies, appelées abcès, en coupant à travers la peau avec un couteau bien aiguisé ou un scalpel pour évacuer le pus. Les abcès sont traités quotidiennement pour laisser ouverte l'incision de drainage; il faut éliminer le pus en appuyant sur la plaie, puis nettoyer celle-ci à l'eau propre ou avec un désinfectant liquide (voir R1, annexe 1). Il faut administrer un antibiotique ou un sulfamide par injection ou par voie orale pendant trois à cinq jours (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1).Module 74: Fractures (os cassés) Si un os est cassé sans plaie ni hémorragie, on dit qu'il y a une fracture fermée. Si l'os est cassé et qu'il y a saignement, on dit qu'il y a fracture ouverte. Les fractures des os chez les animaux sont difficiles à traiter, surtout chez les animaux de grande taille. On peut traiter avec succès les fractures des pattes chez les jeunes animaux de petite taille. Vous aurez besoin de l'aide du vétérinaire pour toutes les sortes de fractures. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Ce qui cause les fractures.2 Quels sont les signes de fracture.3 Comment traiter les fractures.4 Comment reconnaître le déboîtement d'un os. Causes de fracture On appelle fracture la cassure d'un os. N'importe quel os du corps peut subir une fracture, mais ce sont le plus souvent les os des pattes qui se cassent. Les fractures peuvent être dues au fait que l'animal a reçu des coups de pied, a fait une chute, a mis la patte dans un trou ou s'est battu avec un autre animal. Comment reconnaître une fracture Une fracture se produit subitement; ce n'est pas comme une maladie qui met quelque temps à se développer. Une douleur subite et une allure anormale (boiterie) sont souvent les signes d'une fracture. L'animal se refuse à utiliser la partie du corps où se trouve la fracture. Vous pouvez parfois entendre le bruit (craquement) des deux extrémités de l'os cassé quand l'animal se déplace. La zone entourant la fracture fermée sera tuméfiée. Dans une fracture ouverte, il y a une plaie et une hémorragie. On peut apercevoir les extrémités de l'os cassé à travers la plaie. Déboîtement d'articulation Il y a déboîtement d'articulation quand les extrémités de deux os (l'articulation) se séparent. Vous pouvez sentir le déboîtement à l'articulation quand vous touchez celle-ci. Déboîtement d'articulation Traitement des fractures Dans le cas d'un animal de grande taille, vous devez l'empêcher de bouger et demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire. Celui-ci décidera peut-être que l'animal doit être abattu. Les fractures des pattes sont fréquentes chez les animaux jeunes ou de petite taille. Ces fractures peuvent être traitées. Vous devrez demander l'aide de votre vétérinaire mais, s'il n'est pas possible de l'obtenir, demandez à l'agent de santé communautaire ou au rebouteux de la communauté de poser une attelle. Vous pouvez parfois remettre en place une articulation déboîtée si vous avez quelqu'un pour vous aider.Module 75: Les tumeurs sous la peau Une tumeur sous la peau peut apparaître à n'importe quel endroit du corps. Les tumeurs peuvent grossir ou cesser de se développer. Certaines tumeurs sont chaudes et douloureuses. Quelques-unes contiennent du pus (une substance jaunâtre) ou du sang. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: 1 Ce que sont les abcès.2 Comment reconnaître les abcès des ganglions lymphatiques.3 Comment traiter les abcès.4 Comment reconnaître les hématomes sous la peau.5 Ce que sont les tumeurs dures sous la peau. Abcès (tumeurs pleines de pus) L'abcès indique une infection sous la peau. On entend par abcès une tumeur sous-cutanée qui est enflée, rouge et douloureuse. Elle contient du pus. Un abcès est causé par des germes. Ces derniers pénètrent sous la peau pour les raisons suivantes: · Morsures d'autres animaux ou d'insectes comme les tiques et les mouches. · Objets coupants, par exemple les épines ou les clous, qui percent la peau. · Injections ou vaccinations pratiquées avec des aiguilles souillées. · Maladies provoquant des abcès. Au cours de certaines maladies, des abcès peuvent se développer dans les ganglions lymphatiques (glandes) (voir module 3). Abcès dans les ganglions lymphatiques (glandes) Chez les animaux, les ganglions lymphatiques sont analogues à ceux que vous avez dans votre corps sous la mâchoire et aux aisselles. Quand un animal est infecté, les ganglions lymphatiques sont souvent tuméfiés, et on peut les sentir comme des tumeurs sous la peau. Dans certaines maladies, cette tuméfaction devient un abcès. Abcès dans les ganglions lymphatiques (glandes) Traitement des abcès Certains abcès se rompent et le pus est expulsé. Vous aurez peut-être besoin d'ouvrir un abcès et vous pouvez le faire quand il est mou. Pour opérer rapidement, vous devez procéder comme suit: · Nettoyez l'abcès et la région environnante à l'eau et au savon. Enfoncez une aiguille propre dans l'abcès. S'il sort du sang, enfoncez l'aiguille dans une autre partie de l'abcès. S'il sort du pus quand l'aiguille est enfoncée dans l'abcès, retirez l'aiguille et, avec un couteau propre bien aiguisé, une lame de rasoir ou un scalpel, faites une petite perforation à travers la peau dans la poche de pus. Ensuite, pratiquez une incision vers le bas à travers la peau, jusque dans le pus, et laissez le pus s'écouler en dehors de l'abcès. · Le pus une fois évacué, l'abcès est traité comme une plaie (voir module 73). · Si l'abcès n'est pas assez mur pour être percé, trempez un linge dans de l'eau chaude et placez-le sur l'abcès pendant 10 minutes chaque fois. Il vous faudra procéder ainsi quatre fois par jour pendant quelques jours jusqu'à ce que la tumeur ait grossi et soit devenue assez molle pour être incisée. Le pus contient des germes. Vous devez ramasser tout le pus dans un morceau de papier ou un linge et le brûler. Lavez la partie de la peau qui entoure l'abcès. Lavez-vous les mains et désinfectez toutes les aiguilles et tous les instruments utilisés. Si l'abcès est profond sous la peau et ne se crève pas, et si l'animal a de la fièvre, vous devrez demander l'aide du vétérinaire. Si vous ne pouvez pas l'obtenir, vous pouvez administrer des antibiotiques ou des sulfamides par voie orale ou par injection pendant trois jours (voir R6, R7, R9, R10, annexe 1). Ne percez pas les abcès des ganglions lymphatiques, mais administrez à l'animal un antibiotique ou un sulfamide pendant trois jours pour traiter l'infection. Hématomes On observe des hématomes quand un animal a reçu des coups de pied ou a été battu. La tumeur est molle et elle n'est ni chaude ni douloureuse; elle disparaîtra au bout de deux à trois semaines. Vous ne devez pas frapper les animaux ni essayer d'en soulever un par la peau car cela provoquerait des hématomes. Si vous désirez vendre les animaux pour l'abattage, les hématomes apparaîtront sous forme de zones d'un bleu rougeâtre dans la viande. Tumeurs dures Les tumeurs dures ne sont pas chaudes comme des abcès, ni molles comme des hématomes. Elles peuvent grossir continuellement ou cesser d'augmenter au bout de quelque temps. Vous devrez demander conseil à votre vétérinaire si ce type de tumeur se développe chez un animal. La gourme chez le cheval La gourme est un abcès des ganglions lymphatiques sous la mâchoire des jeunes chevaux, mulets et ânes. L'animal a une forte température, un abcès apparaît sous la mâchoire et il y a un écoulement épais et crémeux aux naseaux. Vous devrez isoler l'animal et obtenir l'aide du vétérinaire pour percer cet abcès. L'abcès une fois percé, l'animal peut être soigné aux antibiotiques. La gourme chez le chevalModule 76: L'empoisonnement Normalement, les animaux ne mangent pas les plantes vénéneuses. Ils peuvent être poussés à le faire si d'autres fourrages font défaut. Il peut arriver que des animaux mangent des plantes vénéneuses qu'ils ne connaissent pas s'ils sont transférés une région nouvelle contenant des plantes vénéneuses différentes. Les poisons comme la warfarine (mort-aux-rats) et la strychnine peuvent être des causes d'intoxication chez les animaux. On utilise encore dans certaines régions des bains de déparasitage à l'arsenic, qui peuvent provoquer une intoxication. Parfois, les animaux sont empoisonnés à dessein par les gens. La forme la plus répandue d'empoisonnement dangereux est la morsure de serpent. Objectifs d'apprentissage Après avoir étudié ce module, vous devez savoir: · Quels sont les signes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux.· Quelles sont les causes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux.· Comment traiter des animaux intoxiqués.· Que faire en cas de morsure de serpent. Les signes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux Un animal empoisonné peut mourir subitement ou manifester les signes suivants: · La salivation est excessive.· La bouche est ouverte et l'animal tire la langue.· L'animal a de la diarrhée et des vomissements.· L'animal respire avec difficulté. Les causes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux Les causes d'empoisonnement chez les animaux sont nombreuses: · Il existe une grande variété de plantes vénéneuses. Vous devez vous entretenir avec les membres de votre communauté pour découvrir quelles sont les plantes vénéneuses dans votre région. · Il se peut que les semences destinées aux plantations aient été traitées avec des produits chimiques. Si les animaux ou les êtres humains en mangent, ils risquent de mourir. · La strychnine, qui est un poison utilisé pour tuer les chiens sauvages et les loups, peut aussi empoisonner les autres animaux. · Les désherbants utilisés en agriculture peuvent être toxiques. · Les produits chimiques utilisés pour tuer les insectes sur les végétaux, ou dans les bains de déparasitage pour combattre les parasites externes, sont toxiques. · Les vieilles peintures, le pétrole, le carburant diesel et d'autres carburants et huiles sont également toxiques. · Outre les rongeurs, la mort-aux-rats peut empoisonner d'autres animaux. · Les animaux peuvent être intoxiqués par le sel, s'ils ne peuvent pas boire de grandes quantités d'eau. Parfois, les gens empoisonnent délibérément les animaux. Traitement des animaux intoxiqués Vous ne pouvez pas faire grand-chose en cas d'empoisonnement. Vous devrez demander l'aide du vétérinaire le plus tôt possible. Essayez de découvrir ce qui a causé l'empoisonnement et d'empêcher que d'autres animaux soient empoisonnés. · Le charbon de bois mélangé à de l'eau et administré sous forme de breuvage est un bon traitement en cas d'empoisonnement. Donnez à l'animal 1 g pour 20 kg de poids corporel. · Le kaolin, une poudre blanche, peut être mélangé à de l'eau et administré sous forme de breuvage. Donnez 10 g à un animal de petite taille et 200 g à un cheval ou à un chameau. Morsures de serpent Il existe de nombreux serpents qui sont venimeux pour les animaux et pour l'homme. Les animaux sont surtout mordus à la face et aux pattes. Habituellement, quand nous découvrons qu'un animal a été mordu par un serpent, il est trop tard pour intervenir. Si vous êtes avec un animal quand il est mordu, vous devez l'examiner et écarter les poils ou la laine pour découvrir les deux blessures, petites mais profondes, laissées par les crochets du serpent. Vous devez utiliser un tourniquet (voir module 73) pour empêcher que le venin provenant d'une morsure sur la patte ne se répande partout dans l'organisme. Relâchez le garrot toutes les 20 minutes pour permettre au sang de circuler. Vous devez demander au vétérinaire de venir immédiatement car il sera nécessaire de faire à l'animal une injection contre le venin du serpent.\n",

All Rights Reserved, UGC CARE Listed ( Group -I) Journal 517 Therapeutic Use Of Medicinal Plants Used For The Treatment Of Animals S.Nayak, j. Pradhan, T.roy KISS Deemed University,Bhubaneswar Abstract The present study is based on the plant parts used by indigenous people for the treatment of different diseases of animals. The villagers, medicinal practitioners, and traditional healers used plants and their extracts for the treatment of animal diseases. Data were collected from the experts regarding the use of plants to cure animals. A total of 50 plants were identified and the plant parts having medicinal value were also documented. The study shows that each part of the plant is having some medicinal value. Mainly the rhizome, leaf, bark, stem, and seed are used for the preparation of different medicines. The tribal used the indigenous medicinal plants for the treatment of animal diseases, especially for cattle. Keywords: Tribal, Traditional Medicine, Rayagada, Odisha, Veterinary Introduction Odisha is a tribal state. Around 62 different distinct tribes and 13 primitive tribes are recognized in different districts of Odisha. They constitute 22.5% of the total population. The main tribes of Odisha are Kandho, Gond, Santhal, Sabar, Munda, Bhuiya, Kissan, Didayees, Gadaba, Matia, Dharua, Bathudi, Kolha, Juang, Kharia, Mirdhas, Bhumiya, Soara, Binjhal, Sounti etc. In Koraput district around 52 different tribes are seen. Their main occupation is agricultural farming, basketing, labor, fishing, cattle rearing, etc. Odisha has a large number of tribes as compared to other states of India. Their population is concentrated in three districts of Odisha ie.Koraput, Sundergarh and Mayurbhanj.Their socio- economic needs are fulfilled by the biotic and abiotic components of the forest ecosystem. The Paraja tribes are found in the Kalahandi and Koraput regions of Odisha. Their habitat is hilly and forest areas. The Saora tribes are good hunters and climbers. Bonda tribes generally practice a barter system. Of all the tribes Oraon tribals are economically sound as they e-ISSN 2320 –7876 www.ijfans.org Vol.11, Iss.7, 2022 Research Paper © 2012 IJFANS.

They get food, medicine, fiber, fodder, and timber from the forest. A wide variety of plants are also used by the tribal as medicine for human beings as well as animals. They not only consume edible foods but also sell them in the market to earn a livelihood. They grow the plants by using organic fertilizer and pesticides that increase the nutritious value of food products. The indigenous people have traditional knowledge about the treatment of animals. Even in modern days, people depend on folk medicine for the treatment of animals. The elderly people and veterinary practitioners. Ethnobotanical survey in Koraput district Ethenobotanical survey in koraput district was undertaken by various researchers. (P.K Das.,1995,S.Das,M.Misra,1995) Study Area The study on therapeutic use of different medicinal plants was carried out in the Rayagada district of Odisha. Rayagada is a district in southern Odisha. It is one of the tribal districts of Odisha. Rayagada covers an area of 7,584.7 square kilometers (2,928.5 sq mi) and is divided into eleven blocks. The tribes include the Khonds and the Soras. The main language spoken by the tribes is Koi, Sora, and Kuvi. Agriculture is the main occupation of tribes. They depend on nature for their food, shelter, medicine, etc. The, Particularly Vulnerable Tribe Group, Dangaria Kandhas live in the terrains of Niyamagiri hill ranges in Rayagada and Kalahandi district. They cover 4 (four) Blocks in Rayagada and Kalahandi district. The blocks are Bissamcuttack, Muniguda and Kalyan Singpur of Rayagada District and some parts of Lanjigarh block in Kalahandi District. They speak in “Kui\" language. They are skilled in Horticulture and practice shifting cultivation. They grow different fruits,vegetables and cereals like pineapple, banana, oranges, turmeric, zinger, millets, and pulses in their fields. The Dangaria Kandha is one of the dominant tribes of India. Their main occupation is cultivation in bare lands and plantation of different fruit-bearing plants. Methodology The information regarding traditional knowledge of medicinal plants was collected through personal interviews with the help of interpreters. A survey was carried out in the different tribal villages of the Rayagada district.

One plant each is used for the treatment of fever, liver disorder, jaundice, Abdominal pain, Measles, to kill flea and lice, Eye infection, swollen tongue, dysentery, Yoke gall treatment, sores treatment, Arrest bleeding in wounds, Bronchial and cough treatment, Dyspepsia, Induction of Oestrus, Stomachic diuretic, Anthelmintic, Tooth disease, Analgesic, Treatment of spasm of bladder, neck swelling. Two plants each are used for curing Carminative, worm treatment, Eradication of worms, Bone fracture, and Rheumatism. Most of the species are local and some species are grown in the garden. The plant species are arranged systematically. For each species details of the scientific name, and local name parts used for the treatment of diseases are mentioned. It is also observed that leaves are used frequently followed by root, stem, seed, and whole plant parts. Conclusion The study revealed that plants play a vital role in curing different diseases. The traditional knowledge and practice of tribal people on herbal practice should be preserved as there is a high risk of extinction. These rare medicinal plants can be used further for a research purposes if we conserve them. After several pieces of research, it is observed that plant products are very effective in the treatment of animal diseases. The study shows that due to the lack of interest of local youths in herbal plants the traditional knowledge of plants is getting declined. Therefore proper documentation of these plants is to be done for further research purposes. Acknowledgment The authors would like to thank the local Vaidyas, local people having traditional knowledge. We are also thankful to the authority of KISS University for their support. e-ISSN 2320 –7876 www.ijfans.org Vol.11, Iss.7, 2022 Research Paper © 2012 IJFANS.

In practically every human culture, there exists a vast trea- sury of information of this type, and in some civilizations, notably in China and India, this has developed into a sophisticated system of diagnosis, treatment, and preparation of the medicine. As far as “Western” scientific medicine is concerned, natural substances were, and still are, the source of many isolated chemicals that are incorporated as the active constituents into familiar pharmaceutical dosage forms such as tablets, cap- sules, injections, and topical applications such as creams and ointments. The rise and application of pharmaceutical chemistry enlarged the potential of naturally occur- ring compounds for use as drugs since they could also be used as “lead molecules” to improve their efficacy or reduce toxicity by chemical manipulation of the structures. Traditional plant-based extracts became very marginal in most countries where “sci- entific” medicine became the norm. However, in spite of the undoubted successes of such a scientific approach to phar- maceuticals, the last few decades have witnessed a spectacular rise in interest and use of “herbal medicinal products” (i.e., plant material or its crude extracts) in those places where sophisticated technologically advanced medicine was common, as well as in countries where it has long formed the mainstay of medicines used by ordinary people. This general interest has been followed by increasing scientific and commer- cial interest in traditional medicines, and in 1967 the term ethnopharmacology was coined to describe the scientific discipline investigating the use of these products. Since that time, scientific investigations in this area have grown apace, as wit- nessed by the success of scientific journals such as Journal of Ethnopharmacology and Phytotherapy Research, as well as by good attendance at international confer- ences dealing with such matters and introduction of university courses. This has been fueled partly by the pharmaceutical industry seeking new lead compounds but also by an awakened interest and patrimonial pride in their traditions by many coun- tries emerging from their colonial past. At one level, such research gives substance to traditional claims and reinforces the value of the cultural heritage, but if it dem- onstrates efficacy and safety, it might also lead to substitutes for expensive imported Western drugs. Since Western drugs are often beyond economic or geographical reach of many of the inhabitants of these places anyway, scientific study can also lay the basis for improving the quality of the traditional remedies, thus providing better grounds for efficacy and safety. As far as the industrially developed countries are concerned, intensive farming has been widely practiced but has raised not only food production, but also many ethical and health concerns, giving rise to the “organic” preference of many consum- ers. Hence, the investigation of these traditional “natural” medicines might provide alternatives to current treatments of animals that have caused much concern, such as the widespread use of antibiotics in young animals, producing residues in food x Foreword and thereby the buildup of resistance in humans and other animals. The entry into the food chain of hormones and other steroids for building muscles and stimulating growth may affect human metabolism and health. The study of traditional medicines might provide compounds or extracts with novel structures or different mechanisms of action, with less-acute or chronic side effects, which would make good substitutes for the currently used drugs that are raising concern. This interesting, and in some ways surprising, explosion of scientific interest and study into traditional materials for helping human health care has only fairly recently been enlarged to encompass use of traditional medicines for treating ani- mals. Urbanized and relatively affluent members of society have a mainly emotional attachment to domestic “companion” animals, on which they are willing to spend considerable amounts of money, and it is not surprising that herbal products to treat domestic animals sell well. However, it should not be forgotten that, for most rural parts of the world, animals are important sources and symbols of wealth and liveli- hood. When the animal becomes sick or dies, it may mean the loss of transport, aid to farming, dairy products, meat, and other products such as wool or hair, which provide extra income or clothing. The death of a single animal may spell the begin- ning of poverty for a whole family. It is therefore not surprising that in many societies there is a pharmacopoeia of substances used to treat livestock and poultry. The growing interest in this from sci- entists was reflected in a session dedicated to veterinary ethnopharmacology at the Congress of the International Society for Ethnopharmacology in São Paulo, Brazil, in September 2008. This book is another indication and is the first, to my knowledge, to bring together a considerable amount of information about ethnoveterinary medi- cines from a wide variety of countries. As well as listing plants used, the conditions for which they are used, and the ways that the plant material is treated prior to use, this book covers useful topics such as general research methods for testing claimed effects and safety and the chemical examination of extracts. The inclusion of a chap- ter on benefit sharing is particularly praiseworthy since it is all too easy for a culture to have its traditional knowledge “stolen” to be used commercially by an outside body that returns no benefits. Dr. Katerere and Dr. Luseba have been fortunate enough to persuade leading authorities in this field to contribute chapters, and I am sure that it not only will prove to be a valuable reference source but also will stimulate further research into this fascinating area, with the end result of improving not only the health of animals and domestic birds, but also the well-being of their owners and farmers.

McGaw and Jacobus N. Eloff 1.1 \u0007Introduction In many developing countries with limited access to orthodox health care services, the majority of rural people rely on traditional medicines to alleviate a variety of ailments. Likewise, many pastoralists use customary remedies to treat their sick ani- mals. Commercial pharmaceutical drugs are sometimes available in remote rural areas, but they are often dispensed by untrained vendors or repackaged without printed instructions, which may not be able to be read by illiterate users in any case, leading to drug misuse (Mathias, 2007). In an effort to improve animal health care services in rural areas, it is vital to utilize all available resources, including ethno­ veterinary medicine (EVM).

Several research papers in international publica- tions have confirmed a heightened recognition of the need for rigorous scientific investigation of EVM remedies. Studies of biological activity of plants used against veterinary diseases can provide indications of promising leads for extracts that can be developed and used on a commercial basis. Plants with activity may also provide leads for isolation and identification of useful compounds that may be chemically modified to optimize medicinal value and reduce possible toxic effects, in other words, developed into pharmaceuticals. For common conditions such as coughs, wounds, skin diseases, mild diarrhea, and reproductive disorders, EVM can be a cheap and easily obtainable alternative to expensive orthodox drugs. For epidemic infectious diseases, including anthrax, rinderpest, rabies, and foot-and-mouth disease, modern drugs (mostly vaccines) are preferred. Many drugs in conventional therapy are based on chemical compounds of plant origin or on synthetic derivatives of these chemicals. The search for alternative antibacterials and anthelmintics in particular is intensifying following problems associated with drug resistance and chemical residues in production animals. EVM practices, if proven to be effective and not harmful, may provide answers (not only regarding plant-based remedies but also concerning management customs) to some of these problems currently encountered in conventional veterinary practice. Much research has been undertaken, especially as reflected by the expanding scientific literature, concerning the ethnopharmacological investigation of plants used to treat humans for various illnesses. This has been followed by an interest in plants used in animal health. It is logical that in evaluating these plants for bio- logical efficacy and safety that similar bioassays are used in a laboratory situation where plants are being investigated for similar types of activity. It is essential to build and maintain standards for assessing the therapeutic potential of plants to facilitate comparison of results between different research groups (Cowan, 1999). In this chapter, methods for evaluating traditional ethnoveterinary plant-based rem- edies used for treating common diseases are discussed. Some results obtained in these assays with particular reference to the South African context are supplied. Considerations to be taken into account when embarking on research in this field are also presented and discussed. 1.1.1 \u0007The Need for Evaluating Traditional Animal Treatments There is a pressing case for investigating EVM remedies for two major reasons: investigation of their use as effective agents for treatment of particular ailments and to appraise their safety. Undoubtedly, there are dubious, questionable, or even harmful practices forming part of alternative treatment of livestock, and these need to be distinguished from those of value. The profile of EVM would benefit from validation of certain practices in the view of potentially skeptical, conven- tionally trained veterinarians who may have only been exposed to the results of injurious handling by rural farmers attempting to rid their animals of disease or parasite infestations. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 3 Other advantages to be gleaned from ethnoveterinary research entail prospects for commercial development, whether as refined extracts or lead compounds for the pharmaceutical industry. An important aspect, which falls outside the scope of this chapter, is the necessity for benefit-sharing agreements with owners of the intellectual property concerning EVM (see Chapter 2). This may involve returning value-added knowledge to the community where the information originated if such a community can be identified. Alternatively, they could be included in a profit-sharing arrange- ment from the outset, without raising initial false hopes of massive profits to be obtained from a product that may display exciting bioactivity in the laboratory, while many obstacles lie in the path to commercial success. Various approaches have been proposed to validate animal herbal remedies, such as literature reviews, laboratory and clinical studies developed in medicine, social science methods (i.e., ranking of treatments in terms of efficacy by livestock owners), and investigation of the influence of a remedy on animal production and economic considerations (Mathias, 2004). Much work remains to be done in this area. In a review of the current status of published information on the ethnoveterinary use of plants in South Africa and biological activity and toxicity investigations on these plants (McGaw and Eloff, 2008), more than 200 plant species were documented as used in EVM, and of these, a mere 27 species have been tested for bioactivity in targeted ethnoveterinary assays. It was concluded that more plants need to be evalu- ated, and expanded investigation of those plants already tested in one or two screen- ing systems needs to be carried out (McGaw and Eloff, 2008). The targeted investigation of plants for commercial application in human med- icine has resulted in natural products and their derivatives representing about 50% of all drugs in clinical use, of which higher plants contribute 25% to this figure (Farnsworth, 1984; O’Neill and Lewis, 1993). Plants have a seemingly lim- itless ability to manufacture unusual and original chemical structures. Also, a major mechanism plants possess to fight infection is the production of chemicals with anti-infective activity (phytoalexins); thus, it is logical and reasonable to explore the potential presence and ability of such compounds to be useful in both human and animal health care, for example, in terms of antibacterial or antifun- gal activity. Ethnoveterinary remedies need to be validated before they can be widely pro- moted. Information on the botany and phytochemistry of particular plants may already be available in the literature, relating to bioactivity and toxicity. There is frequently an overlap between medicinal plants used to treat animals and those used to treat humans. It could be speculated that livestock keepers have over the centuries modi- fied human remedies for use in animals or vice versa. It would make sense that similar treatments are used to treat comparable ailments in humans and their livestock. Ethnoveterinary medicines can function as leads for drug development, but per- haps a more useful and cost-effective exercise would be to improve a selected prepa- ration by pharmacological research and development, and the resulting remedy can be returned to the community with addition of value. Local farmers can grow the plants and make money from this venture, and such commercialization can also aid in the conservation of useful species. Other issues falling outside the ambit of this chapter include the necessity to conduct research into optimal dosing regimens and 4 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health effective concentrations of herbal remedies. Potential side effects as well as toxins that may be ingested by the animals and then transferred to humans through milk or meat are further issues to be addressed. 1.2 \u0007Biological Activity Screening It has been estimated that at least 250,000 species of plants inhabit our world (Borris, 1996). A mere 5–15% of higher plants have been systematically investigated for the presence of bioactive compounds, so plant biodiversity is virtually unexplored (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). Plants contain an enormous diversity of chemical structures, which are secondary metabolites modulating the relationship of organ- isms with the environment, for example, as pollinator attractants, signal products, and defensive substances against parasites, predators, and other pathogens (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). Such compounds in plants therefore hold much potential for medicinal applications. Following up ethnomedical leads, whether plants are used in human or in animal medicine, is one approach to selecting plants for bioactivity screening. Other methods of bioprospecting for screening studies include random selection and chemotaxonomic selection approaches. Bioassays used to evaluate plant extracts should meet many criteria, including validity, lack of ambiguity, accuracy, reproducibility, simplicity, and reasonable cost (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). More particular considerations are a high selectivity (to limit the number of leads for subsequent evaluation), a high sensitivity (to detect low concentrations of active compounds), and a high specificity (to be insensitive to a variety of inactive compounds and eliminate false positives) (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). In vitro tests in ethnopharmacological studies are prevalent in the scientific literature even though in vivo models supply more accurate evidence for the activity of plant preparations in traditional medicine. This is largely as a result of the fact that the use of in vivo models is severely restricted in many countries owing to economic and ethical concerns (Houghton et al., 2007). The smaller amount of plant material needed for an in vitro test is often an important consideration. Methods of extraction and in vitro testing need to be standardized so that the eval- uation of medicinal plants can be systematic, and comparisons of results obtained by different laboratories may be more useful. In an important review article on the subject of anti-infective potential of natural products, Cos et al. (2006) emphasized that certain pivotal quality standards must be set at the stage of extract process- ing and primary evaluation in pharmacological screening models. The authors pro- vided extremely useful recommendations to help define a more acceptable “proof of concept” for antibacterial, antifungal, and antiparasitic activity in natural products. They outlined the following requirements for anti-infective screening: 1. Use of reference strains or fully characterized clinical isolates (in the case of microorganisms, the American Type Culture Collection [ATCC] strains are widely used as standards). 2. In vitro models on the whole organism, if possible cell based. 3. Selectivity evaluation by parallel cytotoxicity testing or integrated profiling against unrelated microorganisms. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 5 4. Adequate dose range, enabling dose-response curves. 5. Stringent end-point criteria with IC50 values generally below 100 µg/mL for extracts and below 25 µM for pure compounds. 6. Proper preparation, storage, and in-test processing of extracts. 7. Inclusion of appropriate controls in each in vitro test replicate (negative, positive, and growth controls). 8. Follow-up of in vitro activity (“hit” status) in corresponding animal models (“lead” status). A variety of test systems should be employed in the in vitro screens because the use of only one bioassay yields an incomplete picture of the effect of the extract on the whole system involved (Houghton et al., 2007). Many diseases involve more than one factor, and Houghton et al. (2007) cautioned that the use of a single in vitro test is generally too simplistic and reductionist to achieve an idea of biological activity. An assortment of chemicals is present in an extract, and these may each have a different biological or pharmacological activity, together contributing to the overall clinical effect (Houghton et al., 2007). It is therefore preferable to use a range of tests for dif- ferent activities, all related to the particular disease state under investigation. Pharmacological evaluation of medicinal plants followed by bioassay-guided fractionation can lead to the isolation of pure active compounds with potential for commercialization. An alternative to this route, particularly pertinent to developing countries, is the preparation of standardized, formulated extracts that could con- tribute to an innovative and successful local pharmaceutical industry (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). A growing number of publications document the use of herbal remedies by small- scale farmers to treat an assortment of livestock diseases, from skin conditions to babesiosis and anaplasmosis (Masika, Sonandi, and Van Averbeke, 1997; Masika, Van Averbeke, and Sonandi, 2000; Dold and Cocks, 2001; Van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha, 2001; Njoroge and Bussmann, 2006; Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Methods of obtaining information range from participatory methods to semistruc- tured interviews, field observations, and questionnaire surveys. This expanding doc- umentation of plants used in EVM is anticipated to precede increased investigation of these plants for bioactivity, reflecting the situation in human ethnomedicine. It is generally accepted that a great deal of work remains to be done on recording the uses of plants in EVM. Factors to be taken into consideration by researchers aiming to evaluate the bio- logical activity of herbal EVM remedies include whether the plants are used singly or in combination with other plants, the plant part used, method of preparation, dos- age, and the way in which the remedy is applied. For example, herbal remedies can be prepared from fresh or dry material in the form of infusions, decoctions, pastes, or expressed juices from fresh plants. Masika, Van Averbeke, and Sonandi (2000) stated that the route and method of application of a remedy depends on the perceived cause of the disease condition. Topical applications are commonly used for skin con- ditions, powders are rubbed into incisions, drops are placed in the ears and eyes, and drenches are popular in treating systemic conditions. In other studies in South Africa, it was noted that plants are generally not processed or mixed with other materials and 6 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health are used as single-plant decoctions or infusions for dosing animals or crushed and used topically for wound treatment (Van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha, 2001; Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). This is in contrast with traditional medicine intended for human use, for which processing (milling, extracting, etc.) and mixing of two or more plant species (and even animal parts) appears to be common practice. 1.2.1 \u0007Limitations of Laboratory Testing of EVM Remedies As EVM is a complex system of practices involving more than just the application of plant-based remedies to sick animals, it may give rise to misleading expectations about the degree of efficacy of a single plant used as part of a cure. Diagnosis of a disease made by a rural farmer may be inadequate as it is easier to identify symp- toms than the actual cause of the disease. Dosages are not precise, contributing to the perception that the remedies are not standardized. The methodology for validating EVM should be scientifically acceptable but also must take into account the prob- ability that EVM remedies might not work as powerfully as orthodox medicines. They may not completely eliminate all microorganisms causing a particular disease, but this could allow the body’s immune system to build up immunity against the remaining organisms. It must be kept in mind that ethnoveterinary practices com- prise a complex system and isolating one aspect for efficacy studies may not yield the anticipated results, although the system might be adequate for the conditions in the field. Fundamentally, if a plant-based ethnoveterinary remedy is to be deemed suit- able for further development, efficacy and toxicity tests must meet certain standards. Legal constraints must be kept in mind if commercial development is anticipated. However, this standard is not so rigorous if the validation and understanding of EVM is the aim of the study. Research can be used to select a particular remedy, improve it through pharmacological and toxicological research, and then return it as a value- added product to the community. In EVM studies, traditional methods of dosage and preparation of remedies are vital components often neglected for the sake of ease of preparation and standard- ization of laboratory extracts for testing. For a more true reflection of efficacy of the treatment, it would be advisable to closely follow if possible the preparation and application technique employed by the indigenous user. On the other hand, there is a case to be made for using standard scientific methods to prepare aqueous and organic solvent extracts if extraction of a wide range of chemicals present in the plant is desired for in vitro studies. Traditional remedies may be composed of single plants or mixtures of plants, and if mixtures are employed it is recommended to test not only the individual component plants, but also the mixture in the correct proportions used tradition- ally. Repeatability of activity is important, and together with well-designed screen- ing programs to elucidate activity using complementary techniques, plant material sourced from different areas could be included in a screening program. The accurate identification of plant material is naturally essential, and numbered voucher speci- mens should be deposited at a reputable herbarium to allow other researchers to verify the identity of the plants as well as to make allowances for possible future taxonomic revisions. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 7 A further limitation in the laboratory testing of EVM remedies is the difficulty in culturing parasitic nematodes and protozoa, for example. Parasitic infestations of intestinal worms are commonly diagnosed and treated by livestock keepers. Some model systems are available, such as the free-living nematode Caenorhabditis ele- gans, for detecting anthelmintic activity, but sometimes the only true indication of efficacy is activity in an animal model. It is often not possible to assume efficacy in vivo after achieving good results with in vitro tests. First, it may not be practical to extrapolate the dose from that which is active in vitro to that which would be required to reach adequate plasma concen- trations in the target species (Houghton et al., 2007). Bioavailability is an essential consideration if the remedy is orally administered. Second, factors such as absorp- tion and metabolism may be responsible for discrepancies between in vitro and in vivo tests (Houghton et al., 2007). Even if rat models, for example, are used, differ- ences have been noted between intraperitoneal and oral administration. This can be explained inter alia by metabolic breakdown of compounds in the gastrointestinal tract or by lack of absorption from the gut into the bloodstream (Laupattarakasem et al., 2003). Absorption and metabolism can be affected by other compounds in the extract that may enhance or inhibit absorption, and other compounds may upregu- late metabolic enzymes in the liver. Houghton et al. (2007) noted that traditional methods of preparation of plant-based medicines might remove or concentrate such compounds, and if the correct method is not followed in making extracts for phar- macological testing, then the extract may display different activities compared to the extract prepared according to traditional methods. Most activity investigations in the published scientific literature concentrate on in vitro studies for practical, economic, and ethical reasons. Therefore, there exists an unavoidable bias toward in vitro tests for evaluation of EVM remedies as this is what is reflected in the available literature. Even in the case of in vivo studies, tests of ethnoveterinary remedies in a laboratory where the animals are given fixed diets and kept under controlled conditions, accurate indications of efficacy of the treatment may not be discovered, while in the real-life situation, conditions under which the animals are kept are more varied. 1.2.2 \u0007Extract Preparation The variety of methods by which EVMs are prepared and administered to animals complicates the task of evaluating activity of a particular remedy. The reason for which the screening is being undertaken must be kept in mind when designing the study, including preparation of the extract for pharmacological testing. If the purpose is solely to validate the use of a certain remedy, then it is advisable to closely follow the traditional method of preparation as many factors may influence the activity of the resultant mixture. In addition, the route of administration must somehow be taken into account. In some cases, it is thus possible that in vivo tests are the only mechanism by which the efficacy of an EVM medicine can be verified. Alternatively, careful design of in vitro screening systems may yield a reasonable idea of the efficacy and nontoxicity of remedies. The selection of a screening sys- tem will for the most part depend on the nature of the disease being investigated 8 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health and the availability of validated laboratory models to identify the relevant biologi- cal activity. For broader screening programs aimed at discovering biological activity in par- ticular plants used in EVM, standardized methods are widely used. Care must be taken to ensure that potentially active compounds are not lost during processing; for example, some constituents may be thermolabile or photosensitive. Plant extracts may be prepared using fresh material or, more commonly, dried powdered mate- rial. The plant material can be extracted using water or organic solvents that vary in polarity. For extraction of hydrophilic compounds, polar solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and ethyl acetate can be used, while if lipophilic compounds are being tar- geted, more nonpolar solvents such as dichloromethane and hexane may be used. Eloff (1998b) examined a spectrum of solvents for their ability to extract antimi- crobial compounds from plant material and other factors, including their hazardous nature and ease of removal from the extract. The aim of the study was to identify a more standardized extraction method, and acetone was highlighted as the solvent with the best rating, followed in order by dichloromethane, methanol, ethanol, and water. However, this may vary with the plant species or plant part under investigation (see also Chapter 4). Following extraction, appropriate handling of the extracts is important to avoid decomposition of active compounds or other changes that may affect biological activity. It is common practice to resuspend dried extract residues in the extracting solvent to a known concentration prior to screening, provided the extract redissolves adequately in the solvent and the solvent is not toxic in the testing system. In quan- tifying the extract, some researchers dry down only a small aliquot of the extract to determine the original concentration and then use the remaining intact extract for testing. Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is a popular solvent in which to prepare test compound solutions at a stock concentration (Cos et al., 2006). Test stock solutions in 100% DMSO have the advantages of elimination of microbial contamination, thus obviating the need for filter sterilization, which may lead to loss of compounds, and good compatibility with many test systems as a result of good solubility when diluted to a working concentration in aqueous medium. As DMSO is potentially toxic for cells in tissue culture or microorganisms, the final testing concentration of the sol- vent should not exceed 1% (Cos et al., 2006). Acetone was put forward as the solvent of choice for use in antibacterial testing systems as, at the concentrations used in a serial broth microdilution assay, it was found to be nontoxic to various species of bacteria tested (Eloff, 1998a). This was also held to be the case for antifungal assays based on a similar method (Masoko, Picard, and Eloff, 2005). Regarding storage issues, Cos et al. (2006) recommended that compounds and extracts should gener- ally be stored without solvent for long-term storage or in 100% DMSO at −20°C with minimal exposure to freeze-thaw cycles or humidity. This is meant to reduce degradation of components. Storage in methylated solvents is not advised because of the possible formation of artifacts. In the following sections of this chapter, examples of EVM plants that have been screened for biological activity, the methods used to screen them, and indications of activity discovered in the plants are given. Particular emphasis is placed on treatments for those diseases of importance in livestock. Techniques available for bioassaying Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 9 the plant preparations are described briefly and references given for more detailed information. It is commonly found that there is an overlap between veterinary and human medicine in many communities, but the emphasis here is on the former. 1.2.3 \u0007Antibacterial and Antifungal Different classes of antibacterial assays have been described, and many of these are applicable to antifungal detection as well. Antibacterial assays may be broadly divided into agar diffusion, dilution, and bioautography methods. In agar diffusion, a reservoir containing a known concentration of the test substance is brought into contact with an inoculated medium, and the diameter of the inhibition zone (clear zone) around the reservoir is measured after incubation. Before incubating, the com- pounds from the reservoir are commonly allowed to diffuse into the agar medium at a lower temperature for a few hours before inoculation with the test bacteria (Cos et al., 2006). The types of reservoirs used can be filter paper disks placed on top of the agar surface or wells punched into the agar, for example. Advantages of the sys- tem include small sample requirements and the ability to test up to six extracts per plate against one microorganism (Hadacek and Greger, 2000). However, a major dis- advantage is that this method is not suitable for testing nonpolar samples or samples that are unable to diffuse readily through the agar matrix (Cos et al., 2006). With dilution methods, the test sample is mixed with a medium (liquid broth or solid agar) inoculated with the test microorganism. Growth of the microorganism after incubation can then be monitored in various ways. In agar dilution methods, the min- imum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is the lowest concentration of test compound able to inhibit visible microbial growth. In broth dilution methods, turbidity (measured visually or spectrophotometrically) and redox indicators (commonly a tetrazolium salt, e.g., p-iodonitrotetrazolium violet [INT], 3-4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl-2,5-diphenyl tet- razolium bromide [MTT], or resazurin) are usually used to detect microbial growth. The presence of “cidal” or “static” effects of a certain concentration of compound or extract can be determined using broth dilution methods (Cos et al., 2006). Minimal bactericidal or fungicidal concentrations (MBC or MFC, respectively) can be detected by plating out samples at inhibitory concentrations onto agar and assessing growth (static) or no growth (cidal) after incubation. Dilution methods are useful in testing both polar and nonpolar extracts or compounds. The microdilution assay, using various growth indicators, including tetrazolium salts, has been successfully used with fast- growing species of mycobacteria, including Mycobacterium smegmatis, M. aurum, and M. fortuitum, and with slow-growing species such as M. bovis and M. avium (Chung et al., 1995; Franzblau et al., 1998; McGaw et al., 2008). For quantifying antibacterial activity, Eloff (2000) proposed that the quantity of material extracted from 1 g of dried plant material be divided by the MIC value to give the total activity of the plant. This measure, in milliliters per gram, indicates the largest volume to which 1 g of the extract (containing active compounds) can be diluted and still inhibit growth of the bacterial (or fungal) species under investigation and thus the potency of the extract. Bioautography is a valuable technique that localizes antibacterial or antifungal activity on a thin-layer chromatographic (TLC) plate. Components of an extract are 10 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health developed on a TLC plate using an appropriate mobile phase (i.e., one that separates the compounds adequately but is also relatively volatile so it evaporates rapidly from the plate). A balance needs to be struck between allowing sufficient time prior to bioautography to pass for the eluting solvent to evaporate completely from the TLC plate, but not too much time for the exposed compounds separated on the TLC plate to decompose as a result of exposure to light and oxygen. In agar overlay bioautogra- phy (Hamburger and Cordell, 1987; Rahalison et al., 1991), agar medium mixed with bacterial or fungal culture before it solidifies is poured onto the TLC plate and incu- bated. In a popular method that avoids the difficulties associated with compounds not being able to diffuse into the agar medium from the TLC plate, a suspension of bacteria or fungi in liquid medium is sprayed onto the developed TLC plate. This is termed direct bioautography (Begue and Kline, 1972). After the plate is sprayed with a suspension of a tetrazolium salt such as INT the presence of clear zones of inhibition are visualized against a purple background to indicate microbial growth. Bioautography facilitates bioassay-guided fractionation for the isolation of antibacte- rial or antifungal compounds, but its use is restricted to those microorganisms that are able to grow rapidly on a TLC plate with the limited amount of nutrients avail- able for growth in the medium that adheres to the surface of the TLC plate. In this regard, using the technique for filamentous fungi is inappropriate. Selection of test bacterial species to use in a screening procedure is dependent on the purpose of the study. For routine antibacterial screening, the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS, 1990) (Villanova, Pennsylvania, USA) recommended the Gram-positive Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 29212) and Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) and the Gram-negative Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ATCC 27853). For antifungal screening proj- ects, representatives from the yeasts (e.g., Candida albicans), dermatophytic fungi (e.g., Trichophyton mentagrophytes and Epidermophyton floccosum), and opportu- nistic filamentous fungi (Aspergillus niger and Fusarium solani) could be included (Cos et al., 2006). The NCCLS (1990) recommended an inoculum of approximately 105 cfu/mL for bacteria, while for yeasts and fungi an inoculum of between 103 to 104 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL is sufficient for dilution methods (Hadacek and Greger, 2000). An inoculum size that is too low may give false positive results, while a too large inoculum could increase false negatives (Cos et al., 2006). It has been estimated that about 75% of rural livestock owners in the Eastern Cape province of South Africa use plant-based treatments to treat their livestock (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). When screened against a panel of 10 bacteria and 5 fungi, extracts of Combretum caffrum, Salix capensis, and Schotia latifolia showed good activity against all the Gram-positive bacteria and some antifungal activity (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). Most of the extracts were not active against the Gram- negative bacterial species; interestingly, some water extracts actually promoted fungal growth (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). This may have been due to nutritive sugars, which partition into the aqueous fraction. The organisms used in this study were selected from those generally associated with infections or disease in humans and animals. Different concentrations of each plant extract were mixed with liq- uid agar at approximately 60°C before being poured into Petri dishes. Solvent was allowed to evaporate overnight from the plates, and bacteria or fungi were inoculated Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 11 onto the plates and inhibition of growth observed. It was concluded that the inhibi- tion of growth of Gram-positive bacteria, the Gram-negative Enterobacter cloacae, and several fungal species by water extracts of the plants indicated possible broad- spectrum antimicrobial effects of the plants, validating to a degree the traditional use of these plants (Masika and Afolayan, 2002). Ethnoveterinary plants used to treat infectious diseases in cattle were screened in a broth microdilution assay for antibacterial activity (McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007) against the organisms recommended for antibacterial testing by the NCCLS (1990). Hexane, methanol, and water extracts were found to be most active against the Gram-positive E. faecalis and S. aureus. Gram-positive species are known to be more susceptible to antimicrobials than are Gram-negative bacteria owing to differences in the bacterial cell wall composition (Vlietinck et al., 1995). It was reported by McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff (2007) that a third of plant extracts tested had MIC values less than 1 mg/mL, and it was largely methanol extracts that displayed activity. Ziziphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae) demonstrated excellent antibacterial activity in the preliminary assay (McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007), and the antibac- terial compounds 2,3-dihydroxyl-up-20-en-28-oic acid and zizyberanalic acid were subsequently isolated from the leaves (Moloto, 2004). The first compound was very active against Staphylococcus aureus, supporting claims of the efficacy of leaf pastes of Z. mucronata for the treatment of bacterial infections in animals and humans. Bizimenyera et al. (2005) identified substantial antibacterial activity against S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Peltophorum africanum (Fabaceae), also using the broth microdilution method. The root and bark extracts are used by farm- ers to treat stomach ailments such as diarrhea and dysentery in cattle (Bizimenyera et al., 2005), and the antibacterial activity discovered in extracts of the plant may warrant its use against bacterial infections. Rhizomes and roots of the popular ethnoveterinary plant Gunnera perpensa (Gunneraceae) are used to treat endometritis and retained placenta in cattle and women (Hutchings et al., 1996; Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997), and the possibility that antibacterial effects could be responsible for its activity has been investigated (McGaw et al., 2005; Drewes et al., 2005). Gunnera perpensa rhizome extracts showed only slight activity against several Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial species (McGaw, Jäger, and van Staden, 2000; McGaw et al., 2005), indi- cating that antibacterial efficacy probably played a mere supporting role to the known uterotonic activity (Kaido et al., 1997) in the reputed medicinal value of the rhizome. Drewes et al. (2005) isolated 1,4-benzoquinones from the stem and leaves of G. per- pensa. One of the benzoquinones had significant antimicrobial activity, with MIC = 9.8 µg/mL against Staphylococcus epidermidis (Drewes et al., 2005). Noteworthy antifungal activity in several Terminalia species (Combretaceae) was reported by Masoko, Picard, and Eloff (2005) against various morphological forms of fungi, including yeasts (Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans), molds (Aspergillus fumigatus), and thermally dimorphic fungi (Sporothrix schenckii). These fungal species were carefully selected to represent a spectrum of clinical iso- lates of the most common and important disease-causing fungi in animals. From extracts of Terminalia leaves prepared using several organic solvents, the acetone extracts were most active. 12 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health 1.2.4 \u0007Antiviral In vitro antiviral assay methods are often based on the abilities of viruses to rep- licate in cell cultures. Certain viruses cause cytopathic effects (CPEs) or form plaques in lawns of cells, facilitating detection of antiviral effects of a substance. Inhibition of viral replication can also be discovered by monitoring the presence of viral products, such as viral RNA, DNA, or polypeptides. Virucidal substances inactivate the ability of a virus to be infective extracellularly and find application as broad-spectrum biocides. Antiviral agents are more interesting as candidates for clinical use because they may interfere with some aspect of viral biosynthesis (Cos et al., 2006). Vlietinck and Vanden Berghe (1991) supplied a useful outline of cell-based assays that can be used for antiviral or virucidal evaluation of pure compounds or plant extracts. Toxicity to the host cell system must be assessed as part of the antiviral investi- gation. The Selectivity Index (SI) is the ratio of the maximum drug concentration causing 50% (or 90%) growth inhibition of normal cells (CC50 or CC90, respectively) and the minimum drug concentration at which 50% (or 90%) of the virus is inhibited (IC50 or IC90, respectively). It is essential to gain an indication of cytotoxicity of the test substance as, without this, results do not distinguish between antiviral effect and effect against the host cell system. The choice of viruses to use in a screening panel should include representatives of DNA viruses and RNA viruses and could include criteria such as their ability to replicate in the same cell culture. In the Phytomedicine Program at the University of Pretoria, we have begun investigating antiviral activity of ethnoveterinary plants against feline herpesvirus type 1 (FHV-1) as an enveloped virus relatively sensitive to environmental influences. Plants with good activity in this preliminary screen are then assayed for activity against more resistant viruses, such as the lumpy skin disease virus. No reports could be found of EVM plants being tested for antiviral activity, although many publications reported on efficacy of ethnobotanically chosen plants against a number of different viruses (e.g., Kudi and Myint, 1999; Asres et al., 2001; Lamien et al., 2005). To screen for antiviral activity, variations on virucidal assays are available in the ethnopharmacological literature, and these mainly focus on inhi- bition of viral CPE or plaque inhibition. In the virucidal assays, monolayers of the appropriate host cell type are cultured in 96-well microtiter plates. In the cytotoxic- ity aspect of the assay, serial dilutions of plant extract are exposed to the cells and incubated for a defined period at 37°C in a 5% CO2 incubator. Following this, the cells are examined using an inverted microscope for signs of damage. Alternatively, a tetrazolium salt or other color indicator of cell viability may be used to detect cytotoxicity compared to untreated cells. In the antiviral test, serial plant extract dilutions are prepared as for the cytotoxicity assay, but virus is added to the cells. In their study, Kudi and Myint (1999) applied tissue culture medium infective dose (TCID50) of 105 viral particles (100 µL) to each well. The cultures were incubated for an hour to allow adsorption of viral particles, after which 100 µL per well of plant extract dilutions were added to the wells. The plates were incubated for a certain period to allow development of CPEs, if any, and results compared to the controls Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 13 consisting of only cells and cells with virus only. A range of different viruses was used in this method. In an example of a plaque inhibition assay, Zhang et al. (2007) infected monolayers of host (Vero) cells grown in six-well culture plates with 100–200 plaque-forming units (PFU) of herpes simplex virus (HSV). After incubating the plates for 1 h to allow adsorption of the virus, the inoculum was aspirated from the cells, and the cultures were overlaid with 0.8% methylcellulose in culture medium containing dilutions of the test plant extract. After 3 days of incubation at 37°C, the plates were fixed with formalin, stained with crystal violet, air dried, and the number of plaques counted. Control plates consisted of those without plant extract, and the percentage of plaque formation inhibition was calculated as follows: [(Mean number of plaques in control − Mean number of plaques in test)/(Mean number of plaques in control)] × 100 1.2.5 \u0007Antiprotozoal and Antirickettsial Babesiosis is a protozoan, tick-borne disease affecting many vertebrate hosts. The rhizome extract, prepared using acetone, of the popular ethnoveterinary medicinal plant Elephantorrhiza elephantina was shown to have in vitro anti­ babesial activity (Naidoo et al., 2005). In this test system, Babesia caballi cul- tures (isolated from a horse) were incubated in 24-well culture plates with plant extracts at varying concentrations, together with uninfected blood. Parasite growth inhibition was monitored initially by a change in the color of the culture medium, where inhibited cultures remained bright red while unaffected protozoal cultures turned a dark coffee color. Culture smears were then evaluated using light microscopy to determine the percentage of infected cells. The registered antibabesial drugs diminazene aceturate (Berenil) and imidocarb diproprionate (Forray-65) were included as positive controls. Acetone extracts of Urginea san- guinea, Rhoicissus tridentata, and Aloe marlothii were not active in this assay (Naidoo et al., 2005). Another important protozoal disease occurring in domestic livestock and chickens is coccidiosis, which results from infection with Eimeria or Isospora species. Coccidiosis causes losses worth millions of U.S. dollars annually in the poultry industry, resulting from animal mortality or poor productivity as well as costs of treatment (Williams, 1999). The use of plants to combat coccidiosis is an emerging field of investigation as these remedies may function by mechanisms different from those of conventional therapeutic agents. In one such study, four plant extracts with reported antioxidant activity were screened for their anticoc- cidial activity against an artificially induced mixed Eimeria infection in poultry (Naidoo et al., 2008). Orally administered Combretum woodii was toxic to the birds at a concentration of 160 mg/kg, while Tulbaghia violacea (35 mg/kg), Vitis vinifera (75 mg/kg), and Artemisia afra (150 mg/kg) produced feed conversion ratios similar to toltrazuril, the positive control, and higher than the untreated 14 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health control. Tulbaghia violacea significantly decreased the oocyst production in the birds, and it was concluded that antioxidant-rich plant extracts have potential ben- efits in treating and possibly preventing coccidial infections (Naidoo et al., 2008). The results for extracts of T. violacea in particular provide momentum for more detailed investigation of the plant as a potential therapeutic or prophylactic anti- coccidial agent. The antirickettsial activity of Elephantorrhiza elephantina and Aloe marlothii was evaluated using an in vitro Ehrlichia ruminantium culture system (Naidoo, Chikoto, et al., 2006). Acetone extracts of the leaves were incubated with E. ruminantium cultures, and their activity was compared to that of oxytetracycline and untreated controls. Elephantorrhiza elephantina and A. marlothii demonstrated EC50 values of 111.4 and 64.5 µg/mL and EC90 values of 228.9 and 129.9 µg/mL, respectively, indi- cating good anti-ehrlichial activity. The EC50 and EC90 values for oxytetracycline were 0.29 and 0.08 µg/mL, respectively. Naidoo, Chikoto, et al. (2006) surmised that the plant extracts produced their inhibitory activity by a similar mechanism, unrelated to that of the tetracyclines. 1.2.6 \u0007Anthelmintic Helminth parasites of livestock are common in rural areas, and anthelmintic rem- edies form a major component of EVM, as is the case with human traditional medi- cine. Laboratory research on anthelmintic activity of plant extracts is constrained by the expense, ethical issues and time associated with performing in vivo trials, and the difficulties experienced in maintaining parasitic nematodes in culture systems in vitro. A free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans, has been used as a model organism in broad screening studies as it is easier and cheaper than using parasitic nematodes (Simpkin and Coles, 1981; Rasoanaivo and Ratsimamanga-Urverg, 1993). Notwithstanding the limitations encountered in extrapolating activity against a free- living nematode to activity against a parasitic species (Geary and Thompson, 2001), most commercially available broad-spectrum anthelmintics demonstrate activity against C. elegans (Simpkin and Coles, 1981). In vitro screening investigations have revealed that many plant extracts show activity against the free-living C. elegans nematodes (McGaw, Jäger AK, and van Staden, 2000; McGaw and Eloff, 2005; McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007). A rapid inhibition assay is easy and simple to perform and entails incubating varying concentrations of plant extracts with nematodes for a defined period of 2 h and scor- ing the percentage of paralyzed or dead nematodes in comparison to the untreated control (Rasoanaivo and Ratsimamanga-Urverg, 1993). Using this assay, several plant species belonging to the family Combretaceae exhibited interesting anthelm- intic activity against C. elegans (McGaw et al., 2001). These studies may constitute a first step in validating the use of these plants in treating worm infestations in animals and in humans. In a more complicated screening system that evaluates the ability of the nematodes to grow and reproduce, plant extracts are incubated with nema- todes in appropriate culture medium with bacterial and fungal growth inhibitors in 24-well assay plates for 7 days, after which the percentage of surviving nematodes is Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 15 compared to that of the control wells (Simpkin and Coles, 1981; McGaw, Jäger AK, and van Staden, 2000). Plant extracts have also been tested using in vitro assays with parasitic nematode eggs and larvae. Egg hatch and larval development inhibition against the two most important livestock nematode parasites Haemonchus contortus and Trichostronglyus colubriformis by various plant extracts have been reported. In these assays, the nematodes are maintained in monospecifically infected lambs, and eggs are col- lected from the feces. Test substances incubated with the freshly collected eggs may inhibit hatching in the aptly termed egg hatch assay (Coles et al., 1992). The larval development assay (Coles et al., 1988) detects the ability of plant extracts, or other compounds, to retard development of the eggs into infective larvae. The combination of the two assays can provide a practical indication of anthelmintic activity of plant extracts or pure compounds isolated from the extracts. Peltophorum africanum is a popular plant for use in treating helminthosis, and the acetone extracts of the leaf, bark, and root have been screened for activity against H. contortus and T. colubriformis in the egg hatch and larval development assays (Bizimenyera, Githiori, Eloff, et al., 2006; Bizimenyera, Swan, et al., 2006). The extracts all showed activity in the assays at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL, providing some support for the use of this plant in traditional medicine. Further confirmation of nontoxicity and efficacy is required, particularly in vivo. Various animal models have been used to detect anthelmintic effects of plant extracts (Kahiya, Mukaratirwa, and Thamsborg, 2003; Iqbal et al., 2006; Jabbar et al., 2007). 1.2.7 \u0007Antitick Tick-borne diseases are a major source of concern for livestock farmers. Research has been undertaken on the repellent and toxic effects of plant extracts against ticks, with promising results thus far. Nchu (2004) analyzed the repellent effects of extracts of Allium species, as well as the direct toxicity, against adults of Hyalomma mar- ginatum rufipes. Acetone extracts of A. porrum revealed a high repellency index (65–79.48%), and the dichloromethane extract of A. sativum was toxic to 100% of ticks within an hour of exposure. Lippia javanica and Tagetes minuta essential oils had a concentration-dependent effect on the ticks (Nchu, 2004), and T. minuta delayed molting to adult stage of 60% of engorged nymphs of H. m. rufipes in a growth inhibition bioassay. Thembo (2006) showed that Senna italica ssp. ara- choides ethyl acetate extracts had a concentration-dependent acaricidal effect on H. m. rufipes. When S. italica ssp. arachoides aqueous extracts were fed to guinea pigs and rabbits, the feeding performance of adult H. m. rufipes ticks appeared to be impaired (Thembo, 2006). Plants are used in many African countries as antitick agents on livestock, and 28 of these plants from Ethiopia showed promising repellency activities against adult Rhipicephalus pulchellus ticks, with Calpurnia aurea displaying the highest toxic- ity toward the ticks (Zorloni, 2007). Some plants used in South Africa as traditional arthropocides were screened for antitick effects, with Eucalyptus globoidea and Lavendula angustifolia emerging as effective tick repellents (Mkolo, 2008). 16 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health 1.2.8 \u0007Antioxidant The current literature reveals a proliferation of recent articles describing antioxidant activity of plant extracts. It should be kept in mind from the outset that most flower- ing plants contain some antioxidants, and the activity of a plant against a certain disease generally cannot be explained exclusively in terms of its antioxidant activ- ity (Houghton et al., 2007). Oxidative damage caused by free radicals, or reactive oxygen species, has been implicated in contributing to the progression of a number of diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, many cancers, and diabetes. Various in vitro screening systems for antioxidant activity have been described, including those based on chemical reactions, for example, the diphenyl–picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free- radical scavenging test (Mensah et al., 2004), those involving biological models such as liposomes to mimic cell wall lipids (Dickson et al., 2006), and those involving cells challenged with prooxidants (Mensah et al., 2001). The TEAC (trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity) assay described by Re et al. (1999) has a major advantage in that it is applicable to both aqueous and lipophilic systems. It is a decolorization assay that measures antioxidant activity in compari- son to trolox, a water-soluble vitamin E analogue. This assay begins with generation of the radical monocation 2,2′-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid), or ABTS+, a blue-green compound produced by reacting ABTS with potassium sulfate. When the free radical is incubated with antioxidants, these compounds reduce the radical to colorless ABTS, and this reaction depends on the concentration of the antioxidant and the time during which the reaction is allowed to occur. The level of decolorization as percentage inhibition of the free radical is calculated relative to the reactivity of trolox under identical conditions (Re et al., 1999). The widely used ethnoveterinary plant Peltophorum africanum is used to pro- mote well-being and resistance to diseases in cattle, in addition to the previously mentioned use in treating stomach upsets (Bizimenyera et al., 2005). On screen- ing the plant for antioxidant activity using the TEAC assay, it was found that root extracts possessed good antioxidant activity, particularly the ethanol extract of the root. The level of polyphenols in the roots was also high, probably contributing in large part to the overall antioxidant activity (Bizimenyera et al., 2005). In the study of Naidoo et al. (2008), plant extracts with high antioxidant activity were shown to be effective in treating coccidiosis infections in chickens. After Naidoo et al. (2005) reported that extracts of Rhoicissus tridentata, a plant used for the treatment of babesiosis in cattle, were not effective in an in vitro antib- abesial assay, it was proposed that the reputed efficacy of this plant may result from a reduction in antioxidant cellular injury (Naidoo, Zweygarth, and Swan, 2006). Antioxidant evaluation of acetone extracts of different plant parts revealed good activity in the DPPH assay and in the TEAC assay (value of 2.5). The activity was held to owe in part to the presence of catechin, epicatechin, gallic acid, and epigallo- catechin-gallate in the tuber acetone extracts as demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analysis (Naidoo, Zweygarth, and Swan, 2006). It was concluded that R. tridentata might be effective in animals infected with babe- siosis by limiting the degree of oxidative cellular injury (Naidoo, Zweygarth, and Swan, 2006). Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 17 1.2.9 \u0007Anti-inflammatory and Wound Healing Many disease conditions are associated with excessive inflammation (e.g., arthritis, eczema, and asthma), so assays detecting inhibition of one of the many biochemi- cal processes related to inflammation are commonly used as in vitro screens for anti-inflammatory activity (Houghton et al., 2007). These include tests for cycloox- ygenase inhibition, lipoxygenase inhibition, inhibition of eicosanoid synthesis, or nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) production. Traditional EVM makes use of many preparations to treat wounds in livestock animals as such wounds may lead to more serious problems. Wound healing is a complex combination of processes, including inflammation, cell proliferation, col- lagen formation, and contraction of the collagen lattice (Houghton et al., 2007). Healing of the wound may be complicated by the presence of microbial infection and destruction of cells and tissues by reactive oxygen species. If a livestock owner uses a particular plant medicine to treat wounds, this preparation may affect one or more of the processes described. Therefore, a battery of in vitro tests should be conducted to verify the wound-healing activity of the extract, such as stimulation of fibroblast proliferation, antibacterial activity, and free-radical scavenging effects. Anti-inflammatory activity may provide short-term relief. The development of tests for wound healing, from in vivo tests to cell-based systems and chemical reactions and further to investigations into effects on secondary messengers and protein expression, has been described by Houghton et al. (2005). In an efficacy study of South African plants used for wound healing and against retained placenta, Luseba et al. (2007) discovered that several dichloromethane extracts displayed antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activity. Extracts of Cissus quadrangularis stem and Jatropha zeyheri root showed selective inhibition against cyclooxygenase-2 in the anti-inflammatory experiments. Even though water is tradi- tionally the most commonly used solvent to prepare medicinal extracts, the activity of organic extracts need not be disregarded. According to Luseba et al. (2007), in the treatment of livestock wounds the whole plant material is often locally applied, and in the case of complaints such as retained placenta, for which the treatment mixtures are given orally (and are unlikely to be filtered), active ingredients may be released. EVM remedies may in some cases be applied topically to wounds or skin infec- tions, and rodent models to evaluate in vivo effects of plant extracts and compounds isolated from them with promising in vitro activity have been reported (Kruger, 2004; Masoko, 2006). In these methods, a number of small topical wounds are cre- ated on the back of a shaved rat, and if investigating antibacterial or antifungal activ- ity as well as wound-healing effects, a bacterial or fungal culture may be used to infect some of the lesions. Following this, preparations of extract or compound in aqueous cream are applied to the wound, and various parameters such as erythema, exudate, and wound diameter are monitored throughout the duration of the study. Signs of toxicity are noted, and gross pathology is performed on necropsy. Owing to the fact that approximately six wounds can be made on each rat, the rats serve as their own controls to reduce the number of rats used in the study. One wound acts as an untreated control, another is treated with a standard antibiotic, and the remaining wounds are treated with test preparations. To allow this reduction in the number of 18 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health animals used, the assumption is made that systemic effects of the topically applied medication are nonexistent. 1.3 \u0007Toxicity Studies Toxicity investigations on EVM plant extracts are necessary, both to evaluate the potential toxic effects toward the animal being treated and to exclude false- positive activity results in antimicrobial assays arising from nonspecific toxic properties. In southern Africa, there is a rich floral diversity, and approximately 600 toxic species are known to occur in this region (Kellerman, Coetzer, and Naudé, 1992). Van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha (2001) commented that side effects and toxicity associated with the medicinal use of plants in EVM were rarely reported, although several plants used have potentially dangerous toxic effects (e.g., Boophane disticha, Ricinus communis, and Solanum species). The lack of toxic reports was ascribed to the relatively small quantities used in tradi- tional medicines (van der Merwe, Swan, and Botha, 2001). Toxicity is affected in ruminants by the degradation or binding of toxins by the ruminal microflora or the digestive tract, as harmless precursors can be converted to toxic substances or less toxic substances can be changed to more toxic ones (Naudé, Coetzer, and Kellerman, 1992). It is therefore important to evaluate potential toxic effects of EVM remedies, particularly those preferred for oral dosing. A screening regi- men that includes assays to test for genotoxicity, cytotoxicity, and in vivo toxicity (acute and chronic) is advised. This section is only touched on as other chapters in this volume deal with this aspect in more detail. Several approaches have been followed to assess toxicity of natural remedies, including testing for genotoxic effects using in vitro bacterial and mammalian cell assays such as the Ames test, micronucleus test, and comet assay (Fennell et al., 2004). Luseba et al. (2007) tested dichloromethane and 90% methanol extracts of 12 South African plants used to treat retained placenta and wounds in livestock for mutagenicity and found that none of the extracts was mutagenic in the Ames test using Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 without metabolic activation. A quick and easy way to gain a preliminary indication of cytotoxicity is to submit extracts to the brine shrimp assay. This assay has been used to detect in vitro cyto- toxic or pharmacological effects (Solís et al., 1993) as activity in this assay has been correlated with cytotoxicity in a number of cell lines, including 9KB, P388, L5178Y, and L1210 (Meyer et al., 1982; McLaughlin, 1991; De Rosa, De Giulio, and Iodice, 1994; McLaughlin, Rogers, and Anderson, 1998). The brine shrimp assay involves incubating test substances with freshly hatched brine shrimp larvae and detecting percentage mortality of the larvae. A shortcoming of this technique is that it does not account for metabolic activation of the test extracts or compounds, and it is difficult to extrapolate toxicity against a crustacean to mammalian cytotoxicity even though correlations have been noted with cytotoxicity in some cell lines. As an example, McGaw and Eloff (2005) reported that few extracts of plants known to be toxic to livestock were active in the brine shrimp assay. In a later study of plants used to treat cattle for various ailments (McGaw, Van der Merwe, and Eloff, 2007), the lowest IC50 value recorded was 0.6 mg mL−1. Methods for Evaluating Efficacy of Ethnoveterinary Medicinal Plants 19 Cytotoxicity assays using cell lines are generally relatively easy to perform, although specialized cell culture facilities are required. A range of cells may be used, including continuous commercially available cell lines as well as primary cells derived from animals. Various indicators of cell viability following incubation with plant extracts may be used, including those to detect mitochondrial activity or cel- lular integrity. 1.4 \u0007Conclusion Research on natural products from plants traditionally used to treat animals as well as humans is a key mechanism for identifying new chemical entities that may have interesting biological activity. Isolation of active compounds is not the only use- ful pathway in medicinal studies. Optimization of extract preparations by removing bulky inactive constituents while leaving behind compounds that may have a syn- ergistic or additive beneficial effect may also lead to useful medications. This could be of particular value when considering primary health care systems in rural areas as well as assisting rural livestock owners in managing disease in their animals. Standardized and formulated plant extracts may be an initiative for developing coun- tries to follow up in originating successful pharmaceutical industries that can com- pete with Western pharmaceutical companies for the treatment of various diseases, in both humans and animals (Pieters and Vlietinck, 2005). With the current con- troversy over antibiotic use as growth promoters in production animals, plants with positive effects on the growth and well-being of animals may provide alternatives to be investigated in this lucrative market. It should be kept in mind that EVM involves a complex system that merges treatment of diseases with herbal and other remedies with management practices such as disease prevention. To meet the aims of validating the uses of plants in EVM and developing and providing more cost-effective veterinary remedies, other factors such as socioeconomic assessments must take place in conjunction with pharmacological evaluations of efficacy and toxicity. Economic considerations must be taken into account; for example, a particular natural remedy may be less effective than a commercial treatment, but a cost-benefit analysis may reveal that using EVM is economically more beneficial. Management and prevention issues are integral to successful animal health care management, and promotion of the use of pharmacologically proven and nontoxic plant medicines is part of this man- agement system. In this chapter, the emphasis has of necessity been placed on in vitro evaluation of biological activity as a result of the shortage of in vivo studies concerning EVM rem- edies. Ethnopharmacological researchers must assimilate the strengths and weak- nesses of in vitro tests and take into account pharmacokinetic factors, traditional methods of preparation of medicines, the effect of other added substances or adulter- ants, and the dose showing activity. The use of accepted laboratory testing equiva- lents to animal studies is ethically and economically desirable. More than one test system related to the disease under investigation should be employed to evaluate bio- logical activity, appropriate test organisms must be used, and activity should ideally be confirmed by in vivo tests if sufficiently justified. Standardization of techniques to 20 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health improve interlaboratory comparisons of results with different plants analyzed for the same activity is a priority. These methods for evaluating efficacy need to be specific and rapid and not require a large quantity of material. While activity in vitro does not necessarily confirm the efficacy and safety of a plant extract, it may provide prelimi- nary indications of the usefulness and potential toxicity of the plant. Validation is essential to avoid perpetuation of the preconceived notion that tra- ditional medicine is primitive and inherently inferior. Strides have been taken in evaluating the usefulness of human ethnomedicine, and similar action needs to be taken to objectively evaluate EVM to avoid negative stereotypes that obscure the potential benefits to be obtained from traditional ethnoveterinary practices as well as plant-based natural remedies. Investigating the biological activity of ethnoveterinary plants may provide valuable leads for further targeted research that could generate marketable products, whether potentized extracts, isolated compounds, or modified compounds of natural origin. Overall, ethnoveterinary knowledge is an important resource that stands to benefit not only those pastoralists currently making use of traditional remedies to treat their animals, but also researchers seeking innovative and effective treatments for animal and human disease worldwide.

The unprecedented loss of biodiversity in the past few decades due to industrial exploita- tion and overharvesting has raised global concerns. The manner in which bioprospect- ing, particularly among indigenous people and the use of traditional knowledge, has been carried out in the past has also been heavily criticized, and such criticisms have centered around allegations of biopiracy, unfair distribution of benefits, ille- gal appropriation of traditional knowledge, and unethical conduct when it comes to filing and claiming patents on indigenous biological resources. To tackle these problems, various legal regimes have been instituted at interna- tional, regional, and national levels in a bid to promote the sustainable utilization of biodiversity, including medicinal indigenous plants. This chapter discusses plant and information gathering and then outlines the concept of access and benefit shar- ing (ABS) as one of the approaches adopted at the international level, through the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), to protect biodiversity.

Intellectual property (IP) rights issues and the World Trade Organization (WTO) agreement are also discussed since the proper implementation of the CBD also has an impact on IP rights. Relevant legislation from South Africa, India, and Costa Rica regulating ABS is given as case studies of national laws that have included the CBD provisions/principles. 2.2 \u0007Medicinal Plant Gathering and Storage People have used ethnoveterinary medicines (EVMs) for generations, and many rea- sons have been advanced regarding why the practice continues. Farmers claim that medicinal plants are more efficacious than pharmaceuticals for chronic pathologies. They are reputed to have no side effects, and no withdrawal periods for consumption of meat from treated animals are needed since the plants are thought to be nontoxic. In general, ethnoveterinary products are used after conventional pharmaceutical medi- cines, for chronic cases, have proved ineffective (Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Traditional knowledge is passed orally from one generation of knowledge holders to the next both formally and informally. In this form of knowledge transmission, plant names that are different from the common names may be used to protect privi- leged knowledge. Uninformed persons may not be familiar with the nomenclature that traditional healers and knowledge holders use and will therefore not be able to collect medicinal plants by themselves (Reyneke, 1971). Social conventions also control the collection of indigenous plant material to some extent. For example, the felling of fruit trees such as Sclerocarya birrea (Marula tree) is often prohibited; the gathering of medicinal plants may be seasonally restricted; and the vegetation around cemeteries may be protected by various taboos (Cunningham, 1988). In general, traditional healers are not consulted for animal health care. They may be consulted to find lost animals or for advice and medicines to protect animals against witchcraft and ill winds. Most of the farmers learn about traditional treat- ments from older family members and other farmers. There is little reference to ancestral guidance as seen in human traditional medicine. Farmers are interested in knowing the medicines used by others, and they are willing to share the information. This is contrary to traditional healers, who tend to keep their knowledge to them- selves as it may be their only source of livelihood. Plant parts that are harvested include roots, tubers, bark, leaves, flowers, fruits, seeds, gums, and nectar (Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). The phar- maceutical and toxicological effects of different parts of a plant may differ substan- tially (Iwu, 1993; Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). Plant parts that tend to be constantly available such as roots and bark are used more often than plant parts such as seed or leaves, which may be seasonal (Iwu, 1993). However, the har- vesting of roots frequently destroys plants (Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). The same applies to overharvesting of bark, while collection of leaves, fruits, seeds, and gum is usually less destructive (Cunningham, 1990). Medicinal plants are used either fresh or after a period of storage. Plant material is usually stored in a dried form. It may be cut into slices to facilitate drying. Dried material is sometimes powdered before storage. Plant material is stored in bags, Logistical and Legal Considerations in Ethnoveterinary Research 27 newspaper, glass jars, and cans. Stored plants should be protected from exposure to sun, water, dust, wind, and contact with strangers. Plant material intended for sale in markets is often tied into bundles (Van Wyk, Van Oudtshoorn, and Gericke, 1997). However, ethnoveterinary herbal materials are often used fresh because they are col- lected when necessary (Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Rapid rural appraisal (RRA) methods are preferably used when gathering infor- mation from communities (Beebe, 1995). It is important to organize meetings with traditional leaders and the state veterinary service officers at the onset to explain the purpose of the research. Oral interviews can thereafter be conducted with farmers at dipping tanks in groups or individually. It is important to interview traditional healers and herbalists since their knowledge is rarely shared with farmers. In most cases, the interviews are conducted through a translator, who may be one of the local animal health officers. A general feedback session should be organized to correct, harmonize, and share the information among farmers. Key areas of investigation and discussions are the farmer’s socioeconomic profile, animal husbandry, and local knowledge of animal health care (ethnoetiology, ethnodiagnostics, treatments, and disease control). Detailed information on plants used is recorded, including local names of the remedies, indications, preparations, routes of administration, and dos- age if applicable. Plants should be collected under the guidance of the respondents. Botanical data should be collected using a collection form. Notes are also taken from discussions with respondents. Pictures of the plants are recorded with a digital camera, and pre- cise coordinates of the locations taken with a global positioning system instrument, if possible. Two to three specimens of each plant species are collected, labeled, and pressed for voucher specimen. If a qualified plant taxonomist is not involved in the collection, a specimen needs to be sent to a specialized botanical institution for iden- tification. This is important because a single plant species may have different com- mon or local names, or the same name is given sometimes to plants of different genera or species. Approximately 2 kg fresh plant materials are usually collected; dried under the shade, ground, and stored in darkened glass jars to prevent oxida- tion; and kept for subsequent laboratory investigations (Luseba and Van der Merwe, 2006). Special attention should be given to succulent plants because they are prone to contamination by fungi. Freeze-drying or drying in autoclave at 40% has been suggested in the case of succulents (e.g., Aloe species). 2.3 \u0007Data Analysis Data can be analyzed by pairwise and matrix ranking. Statistical measures of cen- tral tendency, dispersion, and percentages are computed using appropriate statistical packages, such as the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS Inc.). Statistical methods can also be used to identify plants used most frequently in veterinary medi- cine, based on the frequency of association of a particular or perceived medicinal value (botanical consistency) and the frequency of a particular plant species associ- ated with or used to treat a particular disease (Matekaire and Bwakara, 2004). This is referred to as consistency of veterinary usage. There is consistency when the same plant genus or family is mentioned at least twice for treating the same illness. 28 Ethnoveterinary Botanical Medicine: Herbal Medicines for Animal Health 2.4 \u0007The Convention on Biological Diversity At the international regulatory level, countries have negotiated the CBD, which was concluded at Rio de Janeiro on June 5, 1992. The CBD is a remarkable framework instrument that lays down broad goals, key objectives, and general principles to be implemented by contracting parties through measures at the national level. The three objectives of the CBD are stated in Article 1 as the conservation of biological diver- sity, the sustainable use of its components, and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources. The CBD has been ratified by 191 countries; notably, the United States has signed but has not ratified the treaty (Cordell, 2000). The CBD sought to reconcile the diverging interests between states with rich bio- logical diversity (mainly the developing countries of the global south) and states with advanced technology (industrialized nations) by introducing the concept of ABS. Through the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, contracting parties (signatories to the convention) agreed to come together to conserve biological diversity and to negotiate its access. In the context of the CBD, access and benefit sharing is a phrase used to describe access granted by a contracting party of the CBD to its genetic resources to another contracting party to the CBD, with such access on mutually agreed terms (MAT) and subject to fair and equitable sharing of the results and benefits of any research carried out on the resources. The ABS provisions of the CBD have caused controversial debates between developing and developed countries and among advocacy groups, including indigenous and local communities, business, and industry (Siebenhuner and Suplie, 2005). Further, the progress toward achieving the objectives of the CBD has been painfully slow as many countries still have to pass national legislation to give effect to the spirit of the convention. Regulating ABS issues is rather complex and challenging, and in most cases it is an area that is not easily understandable as it involves a milieu of socioeconomic, legal, scientific, and environmental issues. Three regional groups—the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Andean Pact (comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela), and the Organization of African Unity (OAU)—have taken the approach of preparing guidelines for member states to encourage regional consistency in approaching ABS regulation and to help their member states in pre- paring the complex legislation required (International Development Research Center [IDRC], 2004). The ASEAN has the ASEAN Framework Agreement on Access to Biological and Genetic Resources (draft text; ASEAN, 2000) while the Andean Pact has Decision 391 on Common Regime on Access to Genetic Resources (Andean Community Commission, 1996). For its part, the OAU (now the African Union) has the African Model Legislation for the Protection of the Rights of Local Communities, Farmers and Breeders and for the Regulation of Access to Biological Resources (OAU, 2000). The regional guidelines set minimum standards for member state domestic laws and have taken different approaches to regulating the ABS area. In addition to the regional efforts, there is another international initiative that is aimed at assisting with the implementation of the ABS provisions of the CBD. This is the Bonn Guidelines on Access to Genetic Resources and Fair and Equitable Logistical and Legal Considerations in Ethnoveterinary Research 29 Sharing of Benefits Arising Out of Their Utilization adopted in May 2002 (CBD Secretariat, 2000). These are, however, not binding as they are merely guidelines; they are voluntary and flexible and were designed mainly to facilitate the develop- ment process of national ABS laws and policies. The guidelines outline the roles and responsibilities of users and providers of genetic resources and encourage stakehold- ers to use a bilateral approach to facilitate ABS goals (Carrizosa et al., 2004). The key issues that are contained in the Bonn guidelines include advice on: 1. Involvement of relevant stakeholders and capacity building 2. Steps to be taken in the ABS negotiating process 3. Elements of prior informed consent (PIC) 4. Monetary and nonmonetary benefits and incentives 5. National monitoring and reporting and accountability 2.4.1 \u0007Access and Benefit Sharing Historically, genetic resources were regarded as a “common heritage” of human- kind that belonged to the public domain and could not be owned by a single group (Soejator et al., 2005). The advances in biotechnological research and the rise of the concomitant IP over discoveries from living material have contributed to a change in the customary treatment of genetic resources as a common good (Van Overwalle, 2005). Article 15(1) of the CBD recognized the sovereign rights of member states over their natural resources and gives authority to determine access to genetic resources to national governments subject to national legislation (CBD, 1992). Member states are therefore supposed to protect their genetic resources and accompanying tradi- tional or indigenous knowledge by enacting appropriate national ABS legislation. Access to genetic resources is, however, subject to PIC, a fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from commercial or other utilization of said resources. Access and transfer of relevant technology, which is subject to patents and IP rights, should be provided on terms that recognize and offer adequate and effective protection of such rights. 2.4.1.1 \u0007The Principles of ABS The principles of ABS center around negotiations and agreement on PIC, MAT and benefit sharing (BS). The CBD stipulated that the granting of access to genetic resources shall be on MAT and subject to PIC of the country of origin. The CBD also recognized the important role of indigenous and local communities in conserving and sustainably using biological diversity and stated that the benefits arising from their knowledge and innovation should be equitably shared. The regional and national procedures are naturally different, but they all aim to achieve the same goals of conservation, sustainable use of resources, and fair com- pensation to access. For example, the African Model Legislation for the Protection of the Rights of Local Communities, Farmers and Breeders and for the Regulation and Access to Biological Resources of the OAU provides that any access to bio- logical resources and knowledge or technologies of local communities in any part of the country shall be subject to an application for the necessary PIC and written\n",

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable La spiruline est une micro-algue ou cyanobactérie bleu-vert en forme de spirale, d’où son nom, largement utilisée comme complément nutritionnel nutraceutique dans le monde entier. Elle pousse naturellement dans les réservoirs d'eau alcaline à haute teneur en sel dans les régions subtropicales et tropicales, y compris l'Amérique, le Mexique, l'Asie et l'Afrique centrale. Elle est aussi produite artificiellement dans des bacs ou bassins. Il y a plus de 400 ans elle était cultivée dans le lac Texcoco ou elle était récoltée, séchée et utilisée par les Mayas notamment, pour en faire une sorte de gâteau. Elle est riche en protéines, en vitamines et en minéraux, en acides gras essentiels comme l'EPA et le DHA (oméga-3) et en oméga-6, et en antioxydants.Pour être plus précis, et en moyenne selon la source de production : Pour 100g : Protéines 57g Glucides 24mg Fibres 3,57mg Vitamine A 570IU Vitamine B1 Thiamine 2,4mg Vitamine B2 Riboflavine 3,7mg Vitamine B3 Niacine 12,8mg Vitamine B4 Choline 66mg Vitamine B5 Acide Pantothénique 3,5mg Vitamine B6 0,4mg Vitamine C 10,1mg Vitamine K 25mcg Vitamine E (Alpha Tocophérol) 5mg Calcium 120mg Fer 28,5mg Magnésium 195mg Phosphore 118mg Potassium 1363mg Zinc 2mg Cuivre 6,1mg Manganese 1,9mg Selenium 7,2mcg Omega-3 823mg Omega-6 1254mgSuperoxyde-dismutase Alanine 4,7 g Arginine 4,3 g Acide aspartique 6,1 g Cystine 0,6 g Acide glutamique 9,1 g Glycine 3,2 g Histidine 1 g Isoleucine 3,5 g Leucine 5,4 g Lysine 2,9 Méthionine 1,4 g Phénylalanine 2,8 g Proline 2,7 g Sérine 3,2 g Thréonine 3,2 g Tryptophane 0,9 g Tyrosine 3 g Valine 4 g Je n’ai volontairement pas fait mention du contenu en vitamine B12, parce que la spiruline contient principalement de l’adéninylcobamide, dite pseudo vitamine B12, une forme de vitamine B12 inactive. En revanche elle contient aussi de la méthyl cobalamine en quantité relativement importante, et qui est une forme active de vitamine B12. Cependant, les informations à ce sujet sont très contradictoires. D’un côté on nous dit que la forme active de la vitamine B12 compense pour sa forme inactive, mais de l’autre on prétend que la forme inactive empêcherait l’absorption de la forme active... Il y a de quoi y perdre son latin. Et le contenu en iode alors, on n'en parle pas? La spiruline ne contient en principe pas d'iode, mais certaines marques en rajoutent, il faut donc bien lire les etiquettes. LES BIENFAITS DE LA SPIRULINE... DE LA TETE… AUX PATTES... ALOUETTE ! ET LE VENTRE... La spiruline est aussi ce qu’on appelle un prébiotique avec de puissants effets antimicrobiens qui aident à créer un équilibre dans la flore intestinale, en contrôlant le nombre de bactéries et de levures pathogènes, comme E. coli et Candida albicans, dans l’appareil digestif. Ceci est essentiel pour une digestion optimale et une absorption nutritionnelle. Les prébiotiques sont des polysaccharides qui ont la capacité de survivre dans l'estomac, contrairement aux bactéries probiotiques. Ils arrivent intactes dans le tractus gastro-intestinal inferieur ou les bactéries fermentent ces molécules robustes et les transforment en acides gras, si prisé par les cellules épithéliales, en substrat métabolique. ET LES YEUX Spiruline est chargée de zéaxanthine et de lutéine. Ces antioxydants sont extrêmement importants pour la santé des yeux, elle peut donc s’avérer utile dans la prévention et le traitement des cataractes, des glaucomes et l’atrophie rétinienne progressive, la rétinite d’origine diabétique, les dommages rétiniens néphrétiques et le durcissement des vaisseaux sanguins rétiniens (angiosclérose). ET LE POIL, ET LA PEAU La spiruline peut exercer ses pouvoirs sur le pelage et la peau de votre animal de compagnie. Depuis quelques mois j'ai non seulement augmenté la fréquence, mais aussi le dosage et les résultats sont impressionnants. Mon \"gros\" qui mue tellement a chaque changement climatique, au point de remplir un sac d'aspirateur tous les 10 jours, n'en a perdu que le 1/4 ce printemps, et son pelage est d'une douceur Cajoline! Ma femelle a de petits problemes de peau des que l'hiver s'en va (et c'est tot ou nous vivons), a un pelage d'une brillance exraordinaire, et pour le moment aucune demangeaisons soit 2 mois de gagnés sur la normale. Elle et mon 3eme chien (Malibu le Podenco) sont de veritables aimants a tiques, et la encore ils en attrappe 10 fois moins depuis les cures intensives de spiruline. Au lieu de leur donner la dose normale pendant 3 semaines, j'en donne en continu mais a bien plus grosses doses (voir dans le paragraphe dosage) et 2 ou 3 fois la semaine. Mais cela ne s’arrête pas là ! En effet, en 2013 une étude a été conduite sur les effets de la spiruline sur la démodécie canine. Dans le groupe de chiens traités avec une supplémentation journalière de spiruline (et un bain hebdomadaire chimique), 100% des sujets ont montré une rémission des signes cliniques sous environ 52 jours, et une guérison complète sous 70 jours, sans aucune rechute dans les 12 mois. Dans l’autre groupe de chiens qui n’étaient soumis qu’au bain chimique, seuls 3 chiens ont complètement guéris en 80-85 jours, et 80% ont montré une réduction des signes cliniques en environ 64 jours. Pour faire simple, les chiens n’ayant pas reçu de supplémentation en spiruline ont pris plus longtemps à guérir et ont eu un pourcentage de succès moindre (4). ET LE SYSTEME IMMUNITAIRE Des études in-vitro et sur des animaux indiquent que la spiruline peut stimuler le système immunitaire, protéger contre les réactions allergiques en inhibant la libération d'histamines – les substances qui contribuent aux symptômes d'allergie - et possède aussi des propriétés anticancéreuses. ET LE SANG La spiruline est un purificateur de sang puissant, en raison de sa richesse en chlorophylle qui améliore la capacité du corps à générer de nouvelles cellules comme des globules rouges ; elle fournit aussi une forme facilement absorbable de magnésium. Cette combinaison aide à oxygéner la circulation sanguine et a détoxifier le sang. Son contenu en phycocyanine et en allophycocyanine contribue aussi à augmenter le nombre de globules blancs. Des études ont aussi démontré qu’elle augmentait la production d'anticorps contre l'infection et les virus (notamment la grippe et HIV). ET LES DENTS… Tout comme l’algue ascophyllum nodosum, la spiruline peut aussi avoir un impact sur la lutte contre le tartre et la gingivite (5). Son contenu en calcium et en phosphore peut contribuer à reminéraliser les dents, mais sa richesse en vitamine C et K et ses vertus antibactériennes peuvent aussi aider à combattre le tartre dentaire. De là à dire que cela va miraculeusement faire disparaitre le tarte de votre chien ou chat, non, mais en association avec d’autres mesures, absolument ! D’ailleurs mes chiens ont régulièrement du kéfir de lait qui a eu un impact pour le moins évident sur le tartre dentaire de l’un d’entre eux, et depuis l’ajout de spiruline à leur alimentation, en cures, les résultats sont bluffants ! ETC… Enfin, elle contient des acides nucléiques (ADN et ARN) qui fournissent une méga dose de matières premières contribuant à la synthèse de la réparation de l'ADN, un extraordinaire éventail de phytonutriments antioxydants comme les anthocyanes et les caroténoïdes qui sont réputées pour leurs puissantes propriétés anti-cancérogènes. GUIDE D’ACHAT Il est important d'acheter une marque de spiruline réfutable, car elle peut être contaminée par des substances toxiques ou absorber les métaux lourds (plomb, mercure, cadmium et arsenic) de l'eau dans laquelle elle est cultivée. A ce sujet, certains sites affirment qu’on ne trouve des micro cystines que dans les algues bleu-vert et que cette toxine bactérienne n’est pas présente dans la spiruline, c’est entièrement faux. En 2008, 36 échantillons de spiruline venant de différents distributeurs en Chine ont été testés : 34 d’entre eux, soit 90%, contenaient des micro cystines. Même si certains de ces échantillons n’en contenaient que de faibles quantités, les risques liés une exposition chronique aux micro cystines doivent être pris au sérieux (1). Il existe plusieurs espèces de spiruline dont la Spirulina maxima (cultivée au Mexique, en Amérique Centrale), Spirulina pacifica (cultivée en Californie et Hawaï) et Spirulina platensis (Asie, Amérique du Sud, Kenya, Tchad) fusiformis qui sont les plus populaires. Ce petit detail devrait vous aider a determiner la provenance de votre spiruline si celle-ci n'est pas precisee sur l'etiquette. Les principaux producteurs de spiruline sont en Chine, au Japon, en Californie), à Hawaii, en Thaïlande, au Myanmar, en Australie, au Mexique, mais la France fait aussi partie des pays producteurs (spiruliniersdefrance.fr). La spiruline peut être récoltée de 2 façons : là où elle pousse naturellement, sur les eaux d’un lac comme le lac du Tchad, lac Texcoco, ou encore en Camargue, ou artificiellement dans des bassins, à l’abri des contaminations... Et c’est là qu’intervient le dilemme de la spiruline 100% bio ou pas. Pour se développer la spiruline a besoin de certains minéraux, mais surtout d’azote. Or jusqu’à récemment, ce dernier composant ne pouvait lui être apporté que sous forme d’engrais de synthèse. Depuis peu il existe une forme naturelle d’azote, à base de végétaux fermentés, mais qui dit fermentation dit bactéries. Nous entrons ici dans un domaine bien compliqué, mais il n’existe pas 30 moyens de se débarrasser des bactéries, et ceux-ci sont rarement naturels, surtout lorsqu’il s’agit de profitabilité. On doit donc faire face au dilemme bio et contenant potentiellement des bactéries, ou pas bio et contenant des résidus chimiques. Beaucoup de marques portent le logo Ecocert, or, il y aurait une différence énorme entre « contrôlé Ecocert » et « garanti Ecocert ». Personnellement j’ai du mal à comprendre la différence. Quand je le saurai, je réviserai cet article (je n’ai aucun problème à admettre mes failles). La qualité de la spiruline est impactée non seulement par sa méthode de production, mais aussi par la qualité de l'eau utilisée pour sa production étant donné que c'est un chélateur de métaux lourds. On rencontre ce probleme principalement dans la spiruline venant de zones ou on pratique l'agriculture intensive, et ou les nappes fréatiques et les sources d'eau sont contaminées par les rejets de pesticides et autres polluants, c'est notamment le cas du plus gros producteur mondial, la Chine, mais malheureusement aussi de la France ou quasiment tous les cours d'eau sont polués. Autre détail : si elle est cultivée sous serre, certains disent que tous les rayons du soleil ne passent pas, et qu'elle n'est donc pas de bonne qualité, mais les opposants a cet argument clament que si a l'air libre, elle récolte toutes les molecules qui sont dans l'air et ne peut donc pas etre pure. PAILLETTES, POUDRE OU COMPRIMÉS ? On trouve la spiruline sous plusieurs formes, les plus courantes étant les paillettes, la poudre et les comprimés. A partir du moment où il y a transformation, la qualité s’en ressent et cela peut aussi inclure certains additifs pas toujours naturels. Rapport qualité prix, on ne fait pas mieux que la version en paillettes ou en poudre. Viennent ensuite les comprimés, mais attention de bien lire l’étiquette au dos du flacon. Ils sont en général compressés à la machine, et ce processus peut être a froid ou pas, ce qui est rarement indiqué sur l’emballage. Ces comprimés contiennent souvent des additifs de compression, comme du stéarate que je vous conseille d'éviter, ou de la cellulose. Cette derniere n'est pas dramatique mais vous devez en tenir compte si vous avez un animal diabétique, par exemple. Difficile de s'y retrouver, n'est-ce pas? On trouve aussi la spiruline sous d’autres formes, mais intervient alors une autre forme de transformations et des additifs. Outre le fait que cela augmente fortement le prix, je ne suis pas certaine que la qualité soit au rendez-vous. J’ai une petite préférence pour les comprimés, plus facile a doser pour des gros chiens, moins salissants (avec la poudre ça en fichait partout et ça tache !). Il y a environ 2g de spiruline dans une cuiller à café. SPIRULINE BLEUE… Parce que la spiruline est aussi appelée l’algue bleue, certains vendeurs sans scrupules vendent de la « poudre de spiruline bleue, a prix d’or bien entendu. Notez bien la différence entre « spiruline » et « poudre de spiruline ». La soi-disant spiruline bleue est en fait de la phycocyanine, un complexe pigment-protéine de la famille des phycobiliprotéines (PBP) et qui est un pigment accessoire à la chlorophylle. C’est certes un antioxydant puissant, on lui confere de nombreuses vertus medicinales et il fait l’objet d’études. Mais posez-vous la question : comment exrait-on la phycocyanine de la spiruline ? Il existe plusieurs méthodes, mécaniques ou chimique, dont notamment l’utilisation d’acide hydrochlocrique, d’acide acétique, de phosphate trisodique (produit très irritant qui requiert l’utilisation de lunettes et de gants lors de sa manipulation), de propylene glycol, ou encore par homogénéisation, congélation, et sonication. Naturel ? Pas vraiment. Et si on commence a parler empreinte écologique, on est dans de sales draps. INTERACTIONS EFFETS SECONDAIRES Il est possible que la spiruline puisse interférer avec les médicaments administrés pour supprimer le système immunitaire (les corticoïdes), y compris : Adalimumab Azathioprine Cyclosporine Etanercept Infliximab Leflunomide Méthotrexate Mycophénolate Il est aussi conseillé de ne pas donner trop de spiruline aux chiens comme les Dalmatiens a cause du fort contenu de la spiruline en purine, et de leur tendance a faire des calcules d'urate, ou aussi les chiens prenant de l'Allopurinol ou tout autre produit du meme type pour la leishmaniose. Surdosage ? Non pas vraiment il en faudrait 20 fois la dose journalière sur une certaine période pour poser un problème, et si votre chien ou chat mange le contenu de la boite, au pire il aura une belle diarrhée. DOSAGE 50mg par tranche de 1kg de poids corporel, par jour, en cures de 10 a 21 jours max, en fonction du but recherché. Si vous la donnez en poudre, 1 CaC = 2g (soit la dose pour un animal de 40kg) Une autre facon d'en donner a vos chiens ou chats, c'est de suivre le principe de zoopharmacognosie (auto-medication animale), et le laisser en consommer autant qu'il veut. Pour cela, je dilue un peu de spiruline dans de l'eau (attention ca colle partout a la cuiller) et je le leur offre. Ma femelle en consomme une assez grande quantité, style 10 a 12g par session (2 ou 3 fois la semaine), soit 6 a 7 fois la dose pour son poids. Son pelage n'a jamais été aussi doux et brillant et elle semble attirer beaucoup moins les tiques. QUELQUES RECETTES GOURMANDES 1. Carrés croquants à la spiruline et aux amandes : 30g de noix de coco bio râpée crue 2 cuillers à soupe de spiruline en poudre 1 cuiller a soupe d'huile de coco bio pressée à froid 2 cuillers à soupe de d’amandes crues bio en poudre Les amandes crues étant en général vendues entières, réduisez-les en poudre, ou dans un moulin a épices (j’utilise un vieux moulin à café électrique), ou au mortier. Mélangez tous les ingrédients, et si la pâte est trop épaisse et a du mal à former une boule, vous pouvez rajouter un peu d’eau. Etalez votre pâte sur du papier sulfurisé sur environ 5 bons millimètres d’épaisseur. Avec un objet pas trop coupant, formez des carrés de 2cm de côté, et mettez au déshydrateur a la température la plus basse possible. Laissez déshydrater jusqu’à ce que vos biscuits soient bien croquants (une bonne dizaine d'heures, voir 12), les chiens adorent quand ça croustille ! 2. Chips banane spiruline 1 cuillère à soupe de spiruline 3 bananes 30g de graines de sésame biologiques crues, de graines de lin, ou de graines de citrouilles bio grossièrement concassées. 60g de copeaux de noix de coco bio 2 cuillères à soupe d'huile de noix de coco (fondue) Ecrasez les bananes à la fourchette et mélangez et la spiruline, ou mettez le tout dans un mixeur. Ajoutez les graines de sésame et l’huile de noix de coco fondue, puis les copeaux de noix de coco. Etalez sur du papier sulfurisé ou sur une feuille pour déshydrateur, sur un bon 5mm d’épaisseur, et faites des petites chips carrées d’environ 2cm ; faites déshydrater à basse température 10 à 12 heures, ou jusqu’à ce que vos chips soient croquants. 3. Bonbons gélifiés a la spiruline 250ml de bouillon d'os maison selon notre recette (Le Fameux Bouillon d'Os de VMN 50g de spiruline en poudre ou en paillettes 3 ou 4 feuilles de gélatine) Faites tremper les feuilles de gélatine dans un bol d'eau froide pendant 15 a 20mn. Faites chauffer votre bouillon d'os sans qu'il soit bouillon (environ 70 degrés) puis jetez y les feuilles de gélatine préalablement égouttées et essorées avec vos doigts. Mélangez jusqu\\a ce que la gélatine soit entierement dissoute. Laisser refroidir a environ 40 degrés, puis ajoutez la spiruline. Bien mélanger et verser dans de petits moules en silicone. Vous pouvez ne pas utiliser de gélatine si vous faites réduire votre bouillon de moitié, mais vous aurez besoin de la meme quantité finale que dans la recette. Une autre alternative est de faire ces memes bonbons avec de l'huile de noix de coco. En été vous pouvez les donner congelés.

      "Bad breath in dogs! As a veterinarian expert in natural pet remedies, I'd be happy to help you with that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Firstly, it's essential to identify the underlying cause of your dog's bad breath. Common culprits include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Poor dental care or gum disease\n",
      "2. Gum inflammation (gingivitis)\n",
      "3. Kidney disease\n",
      "4. Liver disease\n",
      "5. Respiratory infections\n",
      "6. Inadequate digestion and gut health\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, let's explore some natural ways to help alleviate your dog's bad breath:\n",
      "\n",
      "**Herbal Remedies:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Neem powder**: Mix 1/4 teaspoon of neem powder with your dog's food or add it to their favorite treats.\n",
      "2. **Tulsi (Holy Basil)**: Add a few leaves of tulsi to your dog's food or use as a tea substitute.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Dental Care:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Brushing**: Use a dog-specific toothbrush and natural dog toothpaste to clean your dog's teeth daily.\n",
      "2. **Raw Bones**: Provide raw, uncooked bones (e.g., knucklebones) for your dog to chew on. This helps remove plaque and tartar from their teeth.\n",
      "3. **Dental Chews**: Offer dental chews made from natural ingredients like parsley, peppermint, or chamomile.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Digestive Health:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Probiotics**: Add probiotics to your dog's food to promote a healthy gut microbiome.\n",
      "2. **Psyllium Husk**: Mix 1 teaspoon of psyllium husk with your dog's food to help regulate digestion and reduce bad breath.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Other Natural Solutions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Apple Cider Vinegar**: Add 1/4 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar to your dog's water or use as a mouthwash.\n",
      "2. **Coconut Oil**: Brush your dog's teeth with coconut oil or add it to their food for its antimicrobial properties.\n",
      "3. **Parsley**: Give your dog a few fresh parsley leaves as a natural breath freshener.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember to always consult with your veterinarian before making any significant changes to your dog's diet or health routine, especially if they have underlying medical conditions or are taking medications.\n",
      "\n",
      "By incorporating these natural remedies and tips into your dog's daily life, you may help alleviate their bad breath and promote overall oral and digestive health.\n"

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Ce matin, lors de notre randonnée matinale j’ai cueilli quelques cenelles, et je voulais partager leurs bienfaits avec vous. Pour la petite histoire, c’est notre chienne Yulia qui me les a fait découvrir. Nous avons recueilli Yulia lorsqu’elle n’avait qu’une dizaine de semaines et avait été abandonnée dans la campagne, livrée à elle-même pendant quelques jours. Elle a survécu en se nourrissant de tout ce qu’elle trouvait, baies sauvages comprises. C’est comme cela qu’un jour en promenade, je l’ai vue manger des baies rouges que je suis empressée de lui faire cracher au cas où elles seraient toxiques. De retour à la maison, je m’étais renseignée et découvert qu’il s’agissait de cenelles, non seulement un fruit comestible, mais plein de bienfaits pour nos chiens. Elle semble connaître celles qui sont comestibles et celles qui ne le sont pas. La cenelle est le fruit de l'aubépine, un excellent cardiotonique. Sa capacité à faire lentement baisser la tension artérielle est documentée, bien que le mécanisme de son action soit incertain. L’aubépine ne bloque pas les canaux calciques et n’agit pas non plus comme diurétique. En fait c’est un excellent moyen de réduire la tension artérielle même pour les animaux diabétiques ou ceux qui ont des problèmes de reins. Les feuilles, les bourgeons, les fleurs et les baies d’aubépine améliorent la fonction générale du cœur, stabilisent et renforcent un rythme cardiaque faible ou irrégulier. L’aubépine est si performante que des études démontrent qu’elle est tout aussi efficace que la digitaline, sans ses effets nocifs. Il n'y a pas de danger d'effets secondaires ou danger cumulatif et elle peut aider à réduire la dose de digitaline de moitié. L’aubépine est riche en flavonoïdes et en antioxydants qui sont bons pour le cœur et les vaisseaux sanguins à bien des égards, leurs effets anti-inflammatoires puissants relaxant les vaisseaux sanguins. Leur action anti- microbienne stoppe les infections comme celles des gencives, qui peuvent nuire au cœur. Ses flavonoïdes – le pigment rouge des baies d'aubépine – sont le composant le plus responsable de son effet tonique, et qui soutiennent le bon fonctionnement du système immunitaire et du foie. La cenelle est le fruit qui contient la plus grande source naturelle de flavonoïdes. Enfin, elle contient aussi beaucoup de vitamine C. Elle est bénéfique pour les chiens âgés, ceux souffrant d'insuffisance cardiaque, ceux qui ont des anomalies cardiaques à la suite d’un traitement contre les vers de cœur, une infection ou un traitement de chimiothérapie, mais aussi pour les chiens de travail. Elle renforce l'appétit et la digestion, et aide aussi la circulation sanguine du foie et des reins. Pour compléter les besoins supplémentaires d'animaux plus âgés, elle peut être donné en combinaison avec : Le ginkgo ou l'achillée millefeuille pour renforcer les parois des capillaires et améliorer l'approvisionnement en sang vers les reins et les extrémités, L'ail pour le soutien du système immunitaire, La luzerne et le trèfle rouge pour nourrir le sang, augmenter l'appétit et les niveaux d'énergie, La feuille de pissenlit pour aider à l'élimination des excès d'eau, L’avoine fleurie (sommités d’avoine fleurie) comme un tonique du système nerveux. LISTE DES BIENFAITS Pour Le Cœur : Régularise la tension artérielle, Accroît l'efficacité de l'action de pompage du cœur et renforce le muscle cardiaque, Regularise le rythme cardiaque, Dilate les artères coronaires, Prévient les maladies cardiaques, les crises cardiaques et les AVC, Agit comme sédatif, réduire l’anxiété et la sensation d’oppression, combat l’insomnie, Aide à réparer les dommages causés par les vers de cœur, après le traitement. Pour l'Appareil Digestif : Traite les indigestions, la diarrhée, les maux d’estomac, Traite contre le ténia, Protège le foie lors de crises cardiaques, détoxifie le foie. Pour La Santé Générale : Aide à la perte de poids en évitant la rétention d'eau, Soulage l’asthme en augmentant la capacité naturelle du corps à utiliser l'oxygène, Soutient le système immunitaire. ADMINISTRATION Tisane : La tisane d’aubépine se fait par trempage de 2 deux cuillerées à café de feuilles et de fleurs séchées dans une tasse d'eau bouillante pendant vingt minutes. Infusion : Une infusion d’aubépine se fait par macération de 30g de fleurs et de feuilles séchées ou 30g de cenelles séchées dans un litre d'eau bouillante pendant au moins quatre heures, que l’on laisse refroidir. Teinture Mère : La teinture mère d'aubépine se fait en macérant des cenelles séchée dans de l’alcool de fruit pendant au moins 6 mois, ou jusqu'à ce que l’alcool devienne rouge. Macérat Hydroglycériné : 20g de cenelles bien mûres, 50ml de glycérine végétale, 50ml d’eau, 0,6% d’EPP de qualité alimentaire. Mettre tous les ingrédients dans un bocal hermétique et laisser macérer à l’abri de la lumière et à température ambiante 2 à 3 semaines. Le macérait doit avoir pris la couleur des baies. Filtrez et pressez à travers une gaze (se conserve 6 mois au réfrigérateur). Vinaigre De Cenelles : 450ml de vinaigre de cidre bio non pasteurisé + le même volume en cenelles. Mettre les cenelles dans un grand bocal, verser le vinaigre dessus et fermer hermétiquement. Laisser macérer au moins 3 semaines à l’abri de la lumière et à température ambiante, et secouer tous les jours. Filtrer et doser à raison de : 1 cac de 1 à 5kg de poids corporel 2 cac de 5 a 15kg 3 cac de 15 a 50kg 4 cac 50kg + Cenelles entières : 2 cuillers à café de cenelles fraîches ou séchées par kg de nourriture, par jour. Macérat concentré (Herbalgem ou Phytogem) : 1 goutte/10kg de poids corporel, 2 a 3 fois par jour, en commencant par la moitié de cette dose et en augmentant progressivement ou la quantité ou le nombre de prises.

Outre leur contenu en fibres et en vitamines, ils contiennent aussi des minéraux, mais surtout des antioxydants qui jouent un rôle essentiel dans la prévention de nombreuses maladies, y compris le cancer. Puisque nous sommes en été, le fruit-légume dont j’aimerais vous parler c’est la pastèque. Passons sur le fait que son prix est dérisoire, c’est un fruit intéressant entre autres grâce à son contenu en lycopène, un pigment caroténoïde et puissant antioxydant qui combat les radicaux libres. Parmi ses vertus on compte : Protection contre les toxines contenues dans certains pesticides Inversion de certains dommages causés aux glandes endocriniennes et au foie (1) et (2). Des vertus antifongiques et antibactériennes qui ont fait l’objet d’études, notamment dans le traitement de la gingivite et de candida albican (3) et (4). Prevention et traitement des infections urinaires Traitement des calculs rénaux Prevention de l’hypertrophie de la prostate Vertus anticancéreuses ((prostate, poumons, estomac, pancréas, colon et rectum, œsophages, bouche, sein et cervix) (5) Protection contre certaines maladies du cœur Retardement de certains troubles oculaires liés à l’age. Cela ne veut pas pour autant dire que donner une tranche de pastèque a votre chien toute les jours va le guérir du cancer ou l’empêcher de faire de la gingivite, mais que cela peut contribuer à une meilleure santé en général et surtout en été c’est un excellent moyen de l’hydrater. Autres composants intéressants de la pastèque ce sont les acides aminés comme la citrulline qui est convertie en arginine par les reins. Cet acide aminé est important pour la santé cardiaque et le système immunitaire, mais a aussi fait l’objet de recherches montrant ses valeurs thérapeutiques potentielles dans de nombreuses conditions dont : La démence La fatigue L’hypertension Le diabète La fatigue musculaire La performance athlétique La pastèque contient aussi du tryptophane, de l’arginine, de l'acide glutamique et de la lysine, des acides aminés précurseurs métaboliques de la sérotonine, un neurotransmetteur qui joue un rôle important dans la régulation du moral et de l’humeur. Autrement dit, la pastèque c’est bon pour le moral ! Ce fruit-légume n’est pas le seul à posséder de nombreuses vertus, mais là où il diffère de beaucoup autres, c’est que comme avec le cochon : tout est bon dans le melon (d’eau) ! Comme de nombreuses personnes, vous devez certainement jeter les graines et la peau, ce qui est une grosse erreur ! La peau du melon d’eau est encore plus riche en lycopène et en citrulline que sa chair, et elle contient aussi de la chlorophylle, et des vitamines A, B1, B2, B3, B6, et des oligo-éléments comme le calcium, le fer, le magnésium le phosphore, le potassium et le zinc. Les graines sont-elles-aussi comestibles et riches de ces mêmes vitamines, minéraux et acides aminés, et contiennent beaucoup d’ga-6 (30g pour 100g de graines séchées. Profitez de l’été, et gardez les graines au congélateur, vous leur trouverez une utilisation cet hiver. VALEURS NUTRITIONNELLES EFFETS SECONDAIRES ET PRECAUTIONS La pasteque etant riche en glucide, la question peut se poser si c’est une si bonne idée de l’inclure a l’alimentation de votre chien. La bonne nouvelle c’est qu’elle est aussi tres riche en fibres et ces fibres ralentissent l’assimilation des glucides par le système digestif de votre chien, evitant ainsi la montée brutale de la glycemie (6). Comme pour beaucoup de choses, le moderation vient a l’esprit. Trop de pasteque peut provoquer des problemes intestinaux, comme pour tous les fruits et legumes d’ailleurs. Il est possible aussi que l'urine de votre chien soit un peu plus teinté, n’ayez aucune crainte, c’est juste du a son contenu en βcarotene. Alors venons-en au fait, pour améliorer l’ordinaire de votre chien grâce à la pastèque fraiche, voici quelques recettes qui vous permettront de faire aussi un excellent usage de toutes les parties de la pastèque, y compris la peau et des graines. Si votre pastèque est bio, vous pouvez tout utiliser. Si cela n’est pas le cas, à l’aide d’un épluche pomme-de-terres, ôter la partie verte du fruit, et ne conservez que la pulpe blanche. Attention : alors que la pulpe de la pastèque et relativement digeste, et peut être donnée à votre chien en cubes, la peau en revanche doit être réduite en purée. SMOOTHIE A LA PASTEQUE 500g de pastèque coupée en cubes (chair et/ou ecorce) 500ml de kéfir de lait, lait de noix de coco ou eau de coco (non sucrés bien sur) Mettez les ingrédients dans votre bol mixeur ou à smoothie et réduisez en purée. Vous pouvez le verser sur les croquettes de votre chien, ou lui donner comme ca. CREME GLACEE A LA PASTEQUE 350g de pastèque coupée en cubes 350ml de kéfir F2 Mettez vos cubes de pastèque au congélateur quelques heures, puis passez les a la moulinette. Y ajouter votre kéfir, bien mélanger puis passer à la sorbetière. Si vous n’avez pas de sorbetière, les fruits étant congelés, une fois réduits en purée, vous pouvez vous en passer. Verser dans des moules a esquimaux. SORBET A LA PASTEQUE 1 litre de pastèque réduite en purée ¼ de litre de jus de fruit bio sans sucre ajouté, ou eau de coco Pelez et coupez la pastèque en gros dés, et ôtez les graines (ou pas). Mettre au congélateur plusieurs heures. Lorsque les morceaux de pastèque sont congelés, les passer à la moulinette pour les réduire en purée. Y ajouter doucement le jus de fruit et continuer de mouliner. Vous obtiendrez alors un mélange homogène que vous pourrez verser dans un récipient ou faire des esquimaux pour vos chiens avec ; même pas besoin de sorbetière. JUS DE PASTEQUE Couper la pastèque en morceaux et mettez toutes les partie, peau (sauf la partie verte si la pastèque n’est pas bio) et graines comprises, dans votre extracteur. Le jus de pastèque est particulièrement indiqué en cas d’infection urinaire, de calculs rénaux, et pour prévenir l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Pour les 4 recettes ci-dessus, vous pouvez verser votre melange dans de petits moules en silicones pour en faire des friandises gelées. THÉ AUX GRAINES DE PASTEQUE 20 à 30 graines de pastèque Réduire les graines en poudre dans un moulin à épices, faire bouillir 15mn. Filtrer et laisser refroidir. Aussi indiqué pour le traitement des infections urinaires, calculs rénaux et l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Faire boire ce thé au chien pendant 2 jours, faire une pause le 3eme jour, et recommencer, toujours 2 jours sur 3. C’est un puissant diurétique et c’est aussi un laxatif, ne pas abuser. De nombreux sites font référence a une étude de 2014 sur le sujet, mais je ne suis pas parvenue à la trouver. PASTEQUE DESHYDRATEE Si votre pastèque n’est pas bio, pelez la partie verte. Coupez la pastèque en tranche de 1cm d’épaisseur. Oter la peau que vous réserverez pour un autre usage et coupez la chair de la pastèque en morceaux et essayer de récupérer les graines. Etalez les morceaux sur une grille au-dessus d’un récipient pour récupérer le jus, et laissez égoutter une petite heure. Epongez les avec un torchon propre ou du papier absorbant, et mettre dans le déshydrateur. Pour des morceaux de cette épaisseur, cela prend environ 8 à 10 heures à 55 degrés. Il est conseillé de retourner les morceaux de pastèque au bout de 6 heures pour que ça déshydrate bien des 2 cotés, et de ne pas trop les serrer car beaucoup d’humidité va s’en échapper. Vous aurez ainsi d’excellentes friandises qu’il ne faudra pas entasser les unes sur les autres car elles vont se coller. Séparez les a l’aide de papier sulfurisé, et n’en donnez pas trop à votre chien, c’est une confiserie. Mesdames et messieurs, a vos tabliers!

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable La spiruline est une micro-algue ou cyanobactérie bleu-vert en forme de spirale, d’où son nom, largement utilisée comme complément nutritionnel nutraceutique dans le monde entier. Elle pousse naturellement dans les réservoirs d'eau alcaline à haute teneur en sel dans les régions subtropicales et tropicales, y compris l'Amérique, le Mexique, l'Asie et l'Afrique centrale. Elle est aussi produite artificiellement dans des bacs ou bassins. Il y a plus de 400 ans elle était cultivée dans le lac Texcoco ou elle était récoltée, séchée et utilisée par les Mayas notamment, pour en faire une sorte de gâteau. Elle est riche en protéines, en vitamines et en minéraux, en acides gras essentiels comme l'EPA et le DHA (oméga-3) et en oméga-6, et en antioxydants.Pour être plus précis, et en moyenne selon la source de production : Pour 100g : Protéines 57g Glucides 24mg Fibres 3,57mg Vitamine A 570IU Vitamine B1 Thiamine 2,4mg Vitamine B2 Riboflavine 3,7mg Vitamine B3 Niacine 12,8mg Vitamine B4 Choline 66mg Vitamine B5 Acide Pantothénique 3,5mg Vitamine B6 0,4mg Vitamine C 10,1mg Vitamine K 25mcg Vitamine E (Alpha Tocophérol) 5mg Calcium 120mg Fer 28,5mg Magnésium 195mg Phosphore 118mg Potassium 1363mg Zinc 2mg Cuivre 6,1mg Manganese 1,9mg Selenium 7,2mcg Omega-3 823mg Omega-6 1254mgSuperoxyde-dismutase Alanine 4,7 g Arginine 4,3 g Acide aspartique 6,1 g Cystine 0,6 g Acide glutamique 9,1 g Glycine 3,2 g Histidine 1 g Isoleucine 3,5 g Leucine 5,4 g Lysine 2,9 Méthionine 1,4 g Phénylalanine 2,8 g Proline 2,7 g Sérine 3,2 g Thréonine 3,2 g Tryptophane 0,9 g Tyrosine 3 g Valine 4 g Je n’ai volontairement pas fait mention du contenu en vitamine B12, parce que la spiruline contient principalement de l’adéninylcobamide, dite pseudo vitamine B12, une forme de vitamine B12 inactive. En revanche elle contient aussi de la méthyl cobalamine en quantité relativement importante, et qui est une forme active de vitamine B12. Cependant, les informations à ce sujet sont très contradictoires. D’un côté on nous dit que la forme active de la vitamine B12 compense pour sa forme inactive, mais de l’autre on prétend que la forme inactive empêcherait l’absorption de la forme active... Il y a de quoi y perdre son latin. Et le contenu en iode alors, on n'en parle pas? La spiruline ne contient en principe pas d'iode, mais certaines marques en rajoutent, il faut donc bien lire les etiquettes. LES BIENFAITS DE LA SPIRULINE... DE LA TETE… AUX PATTES... ALOUETTE ! ET LE VENTRE... La spiruline est aussi ce qu’on appelle un prébiotique avec de puissants effets antimicrobiens qui aident à créer un équilibre dans la flore intestinale, en contrôlant le nombre de bactéries et de levures pathogènes, comme E. coli et Candida albicans, dans l’appareil digestif. Ceci est essentiel pour une digestion optimale et une absorption nutritionnelle. Les prébiotiques sont des polysaccharides qui ont la capacité de survivre dans l'estomac, contrairement aux bactéries probiotiques. Ils arrivent intactes dans le tractus gastro-intestinal inferieur ou les bactéries fermentent ces molécules robustes et les transforment en acides gras, si prisé par les cellules épithéliales, en substrat métabolique. ET LES YEUX Spiruline est chargée de zéaxanthine et de lutéine. Ces antioxydants sont extrêmement importants pour la santé des yeux, elle peut donc s’avérer utile dans la prévention et le traitement des cataractes, des glaucomes et l’atrophie rétinienne progressive, la rétinite d’origine diabétique, les dommages rétiniens néphrétiques et le durcissement des vaisseaux sanguins rétiniens (angiosclérose). ET LE POIL, ET LA PEAU La spiruline peut exercer ses pouvoirs sur le pelage et la peau de votre animal de compagnie. Depuis quelques mois j'ai non seulement augmenté la fréquence, mais aussi le dosage et les résultats sont impressionnants. Mon \"gros\" qui mue tellement a chaque changement climatique, au point de remplir un sac d'aspirateur tous les 10 jours, n'en a perdu que le 1/4 ce printemps, et son pelage est d'une douceur Cajoline! Ma femelle a de petits problemes de peau des que l'hiver s'en va (et c'est tot ou nous vivons), a un pelage d'une brillance exraordinaire, et pour le moment aucune demangeaisons soit 2 mois de gagnés sur la normale. Elle et mon 3eme chien (Malibu le Podenco) sont de veritables aimants a tiques, et la encore ils en attrappe 10 fois moins depuis les cures intensives de spiruline. Au lieu de leur donner la dose normale pendant 3 semaines, j'en donne en continu mais a bien plus grosses doses (voir dans le paragraphe dosage) et 2 ou 3 fois la semaine. Mais cela ne s’arrête pas là ! En effet, en 2013 une étude a été conduite sur les effets de la spiruline sur la démodécie canine. Dans le groupe de chiens traités avec une supplémentation journalière de spiruline (et un bain hebdomadaire chimique), 100% des sujets ont montré une rémission des signes cliniques sous environ 52 jours, et une guérison complète sous 70 jours, sans aucune rechute dans les 12 mois. Dans l’autre groupe de chiens qui n’étaient soumis qu’au bain chimique, seuls 3 chiens ont complètement guéris en 80-85 jours, et 80% ont montré une réduction des signes cliniques en environ 64 jours. Pour faire simple, les chiens n’ayant pas reçu de supplémentation en spiruline ont pris plus longtemps à guérir et ont eu un pourcentage de succès moindre (4). ET LE SYSTEME IMMUNITAIRE Des études in-vitro et sur des animaux indiquent que la spiruline peut stimuler le système immunitaire, protéger contre les réactions allergiques en inhibant la libération d'histamines – les substances qui contribuent aux symptômes d'allergie - et possède aussi des propriétés anticancéreuses. ET LE SANG La spiruline est un purificateur de sang puissant, en raison de sa richesse en chlorophylle qui améliore la capacité du corps à générer de nouvelles cellules comme des globules rouges ; elle fournit aussi une forme facilement absorbable de magnésium. Cette combinaison aide à oxygéner la circulation sanguine et a détoxifier le sang. Son contenu en phycocyanine et en allophycocyanine contribue aussi à augmenter le nombre de globules blancs. Des études ont aussi démontré qu’elle augmentait la production d'anticorps contre l'infection et les virus (notamment la grippe et HIV). ET LES DENTS… Tout comme l’algue ascophyllum nodosum, la spiruline peut aussi avoir un impact sur la lutte contre le tartre et la gingivite (5). Son contenu en calcium et en phosphore peut contribuer à reminéraliser les dents, mais sa richesse en vitamine C et K et ses vertus antibactériennes peuvent aussi aider à combattre le tartre dentaire. De là à dire que cela va miraculeusement faire disparaitre le tarte de votre chien ou chat, non, mais en association avec d’autres mesures, absolument ! D’ailleurs mes chiens ont régulièrement du kéfir de lait qui a eu un impact pour le moins évident sur le tartre dentaire de l’un d’entre eux, et depuis l’ajout de spiruline à leur alimentation, en cures, les résultats sont bluffants ! ETC… Enfin, elle contient des acides nucléiques (ADN et ARN) qui fournissent une méga dose de matières premières contribuant à la synthèse de la réparation de l'ADN, un extraordinaire éventail de phytonutriments antioxydants comme les anthocyanes et les caroténoïdes qui sont réputées pour leurs puissantes propriétés anti-cancérogènes. GUIDE D’ACHAT Il est important d'acheter une marque de spiruline réfutable, car elle peut être contaminée par des substances toxiques ou absorber les métaux lourds (plomb, mercure, cadmium et arsenic) de l'eau dans laquelle elle est cultivée. A ce sujet, certains sites affirment qu’on ne trouve des micro cystines que dans les algues bleu-vert et que cette toxine bactérienne n’est pas présente dans la spiruline, c’est entièrement faux. En 2008, 36 échantillons de spiruline venant de différents distributeurs en Chine ont été testés : 34 d’entre eux, soit 90%, contenaient des micro cystines. Même si certains de ces échantillons n’en contenaient que de faibles quantités, les risques liés une exposition chronique aux micro cystines doivent être pris au sérieux (1). Il existe plusieurs espèces de spiruline dont la Spirulina maxima (cultivée au Mexique, en Amérique Centrale), Spirulina pacifica (cultivée en Californie et Hawaï) et Spirulina platensis (Asie, Amérique du Sud, Kenya, Tchad) fusiformis qui sont les plus populaires. Ce petit detail devrait vous aider a determiner la provenance de votre spiruline si celle-ci n'est pas precisee sur l'etiquette. Les principaux producteurs de spiruline sont en Chine, au Japon, en Californie), à Hawaii, en Thaïlande, au Myanmar, en Australie, au Mexique, mais la France fait aussi partie des pays producteurs (spiruliniersdefrance.fr). La spiruline peut être récoltée de 2 façons : là où elle pousse naturellement, sur les eaux d’un lac comme le lac du Tchad, lac Texcoco, ou encore en Camargue, ou artificiellement dans des bassins, à l’abri des contaminations... Et c’est là qu’intervient le dilemme de la spiruline 100% bio ou pas. Pour se développer la spiruline a besoin de certains minéraux, mais surtout d’azote. Or jusqu’à récemment, ce dernier composant ne pouvait lui être apporté que sous forme d’engrais de synthèse. Depuis peu il existe une forme naturelle d’azote, à base de végétaux fermentés, mais qui dit fermentation dit bactéries. Nous entrons ici dans un domaine bien compliqué, mais il n’existe pas 30 moyens de se débarrasser des bactéries, et ceux-ci sont rarement naturels, surtout lorsqu’il s’agit de profitabilité. On doit donc faire face au dilemme bio et contenant potentiellement des bactéries, ou pas bio et contenant des résidus chimiques. Beaucoup de marques portent le logo Ecocert, or, il y aurait une différence énorme entre « contrôlé Ecocert » et « garanti Ecocert ». Personnellement j’ai du mal à comprendre la différence. Quand je le saurai, je réviserai cet article (je n’ai aucun problème à admettre mes failles). La qualité de la spiruline est impactée non seulement par sa méthode de production, mais aussi par la qualité de l'eau utilisée pour sa production étant donné que c'est un chélateur de métaux lourds. On rencontre ce probleme principalement dans la spiruline venant de zones ou on pratique l'agriculture intensive, et ou les nappes fréatiques et les sources d'eau sont contaminées par les rejets de pesticides et autres polluants, c'est notamment le cas du plus gros producteur mondial, la Chine, mais malheureusement aussi de la France ou quasiment tous les cours d'eau sont polués. Autre détail : si elle est cultivée sous serre, certains disent que tous les rayons du soleil ne passent pas, et qu'elle n'est donc pas de bonne qualité, mais les opposants a cet argument clament que si a l'air libre, elle récolte toutes les molecules qui sont dans l'air et ne peut donc pas etre pure. PAILLETTES, POUDRE OU COMPRIMÉS ? On trouve la spiruline sous plusieurs formes, les plus courantes étant les paillettes, la poudre et les comprimés. A partir du moment où il y a transformation, la qualité s’en ressent et cela peut aussi inclure certains additifs pas toujours naturels. Rapport qualité prix, on ne fait pas mieux que la version en paillettes ou en poudre. Viennent ensuite les comprimés, mais attention de bien lire l’étiquette au dos du flacon. Ils sont en général compressés à la machine, et ce processus peut être a froid ou pas, ce qui est rarement indiqué sur l’emballage. Ces comprimés contiennent souvent des additifs de compression, comme du stéarate que je vous conseille d'éviter, ou de la cellulose. Cette derniere n'est pas dramatique mais vous devez en tenir compte si vous avez un animal diabétique, par exemple. Difficile de s'y retrouver, n'est-ce pas? On trouve aussi la spiruline sous d’autres formes, mais intervient alors une autre forme de transformations et des additifs. Outre le fait que cela augmente fortement le prix, je ne suis pas certaine que la qualité soit au rendez-vous. J’ai une petite préférence pour les comprimés, plus facile a doser pour des gros chiens, moins salissants (avec la poudre ça en fichait partout et ça tache !). Il y a environ 2g de spiruline dans une cuiller à café. SPIRULINE BLEUE… Parce que la spiruline est aussi appelée l’algue bleue, certains vendeurs sans scrupules vendent de la « poudre de spiruline bleue, a prix d’or bien entendu. Notez bien la différence entre « spiruline » et « poudre de spiruline ». La soi-disant spiruline bleue est en fait de la phycocyanine, un complexe pigment-protéine de la famille des phycobiliprotéines (PBP) et qui est un pigment accessoire à la chlorophylle. C’est certes un antioxydant puissant, on lui confere de nombreuses vertus medicinales et il fait l’objet d’études. Mais posez-vous la question : comment exrait-on la phycocyanine de la spiruline ? Il existe plusieurs méthodes, mécaniques ou chimique, dont notamment l’utilisation d’acide hydrochlocrique, d’acide acétique, de phosphate trisodique (produit très irritant qui requiert l’utilisation de lunettes et de gants lors de sa manipulation), de propylene glycol, ou encore par homogénéisation, congélation, et sonication. Naturel ? Pas vraiment. Et si on commence a parler empreinte écologique, on est dans de sales draps. INTERACTIONS EFFETS SECONDAIRES Il est possible que la spiruline puisse interférer avec les médicaments administrés pour supprimer le système immunitaire (les corticoïdes), y compris : Adalimumab Azathioprine Cyclosporine Etanercept Infliximab Leflunomide Méthotrexate Mycophénolate Il est aussi conseillé de ne pas donner trop de spiruline aux chiens comme les Dalmatiens a cause du fort contenu de la spiruline en purine, et de leur tendance a faire des calcules d'urate, ou aussi les chiens prenant de l'Allopurinol ou tout autre produit du meme type pour la leishmaniose. Surdosage ? Non pas vraiment il en faudrait 20 fois la dose journalière sur une certaine période pour poser un problème, et si votre chien ou chat mange le contenu de la boite, au pire il aura une belle diarrhée. DOSAGE 50mg par tranche de 1kg de poids corporel, par jour, en cures de 10 a 21 jours max, en fonction du but recherché. Si vous la donnez en poudre, 1 CaC = 2g (soit la dose pour un animal de 40kg) Une autre facon d'en donner a vos chiens ou chats, c'est de suivre le principe de zoopharmacognosie (auto-medication animale), et le laisser en consommer autant qu'il veut. Pour cela, je dilue un peu de spiruline dans de l'eau (attention ca colle partout a la cuiller) et je le leur offre. Ma femelle en consomme une assez grande quantité, style 10 a 12g par session (2 ou 3 fois la semaine), soit 6 a 7 fois la dose pour son poids. Son pelage n'a jamais été aussi doux et brillant et elle semble attirer beaucoup moins les tiques. QUELQUES RECETTES GOURMANDES 1. Carrés croquants à la spiruline et aux amandes : 30g de noix de coco bio râpée crue 2 cuillers à soupe de spiruline en poudre 1 cuiller a soupe d'huile de coco bio pressée à froid 2 cuillers à soupe de d’amandes crues bio en poudre Les amandes crues étant en général vendues entières, réduisez-les en poudre, ou dans un moulin a épices (j’utilise un vieux moulin à café électrique), ou au mortier. Mélangez tous les ingrédients, et si la pâte est trop épaisse et a du mal à former une boule, vous pouvez rajouter un peu d’eau. Etalez votre pâte sur du papier sulfurisé sur environ 5 bons millimètres d’épaisseur. Avec un objet pas trop coupant, formez des carrés de 2cm de côté, et mettez au déshydrateur a la température la plus basse possible. Laissez déshydrater jusqu’à ce que vos biscuits soient bien croquants (une bonne dizaine d'heures, voir 12), les chiens adorent quand ça croustille ! 2. Chips banane spiruline 1 cuillère à soupe de spiruline 3 bananes 30g de graines de sésame biologiques crues, de graines de lin, ou de graines de citrouilles bio grossièrement concassées. 60g de copeaux de noix de coco bio 2 cuillères à soupe d'huile de noix de coco (fondue) Ecrasez les bananes à la fourchette et mélangez et la spiruline, ou mettez le tout dans un mixeur. Ajoutez les graines de sésame et l’huile de noix de coco fondue, puis les copeaux de noix de coco. Etalez sur du papier sulfurisé ou sur une feuille pour déshydrateur, sur un bon 5mm d’épaisseur, et faites des petites chips carrées d’environ 2cm ; faites déshydrater à basse température 10 à 12 heures, ou jusqu’à ce que vos chips soient croquants. 3. Bonbons gélifiés a la spiruline 250ml de bouillon d'os maison selon notre recette (Le Fameux Bouillon d'Os de VMN 50g de spiruline en poudre ou en paillettes 3 ou 4 feuilles de gélatine) Faites tremper les feuilles de gélatine dans un bol d'eau froide pendant 15 a 20mn. Faites chauffer votre bouillon d'os sans qu'il soit bouillon (environ 70 degrés) puis jetez y les feuilles de gélatine préalablement égouttées et essorées avec vos doigts. Mélangez jusqu\\a ce que la gélatine soit entierement dissoute. Laisser refroidir a environ 40 degrés, puis ajoutez la spiruline. Bien mélanger et verser dans de petits moules en silicone. Vous pouvez ne pas utiliser de gélatine si vous faites réduire votre bouillon de moitié, mais vous aurez besoin de la meme quantité finale que dans la recette. Une autre alternative est de faire ces memes bonbons avec de l'huile de noix de coco. En été vous pouvez les donner congelés.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Doug English, un vétérinaire au Marlin Coast Vet Hospital (North Queensland, Australie), utilise le curcuma depuis plusieurs décennies. Il a pu observer des résultats très positifs sur les dermatites allergiques, l'atopie, le Queensland Itch chez les chevaux, l'arthrite chez les chiens et les chevaux, les irritations intestinales, une capacité athlétique accrue et une amélioration générale de la santé. D’après plus de 7000 recherches, il a été démontré que le curcuma dépassait de très loin les produits pharmaceutiques dans ses effets contre plusieurs maladies chroniques et débilitantes, sans effets secondaires indésirables. C’est est une épice très riche en antioxydants, connue pour soulager les symptômes et offrir une protection pour toute une série de conditions. Divers essais cliniques ont montré des effets prometteurs dans le traitement de certains cancers, de maladies cardiovasculaires, de problèmes digestifs comme la maladie de Crohn, le côlon irritable, l'ulcère gastrique, l'inflammation gastrique, la colite ulcéreuse, etc. mais aussi le diabète, certaines formes de pancréatites, l’uvéite, le SIDA, certaines affections rénales, l’arthrose, la prostatite bactérienne chronique, etc. Le curcuma a aussi démontré une protection contre certaines conditions hépatiques. Il contribue à la perte de poids en bloquant la propagation de la graisse dans les tissus, en inhibant la croissance de nouveaux vaisseaux sanguins, appelée angiogenèse, qui est nécessaire pour construire le tissu adipeux. De plus, les taux de glucose, acides gras, cholestérol et stéatose hépatique sont aussi réduits. Il peut dont favoriser la perte de poids. Le curcuma favorise la croissance des cellules saines et renforce le corps au niveau cellulaire. En d'autres termes, il a la capacité de promouvoir la division cellulaire saine, et le potentiel d’aider à bloquer les radicaux libres qui favorisent la croissance cellulaire anormale (les cancers, les lymphomes). Associé aux oméga-3, il peut contribuer à la réparation des cellules du cerveau de de la moelle épinière (2), et de récentes études pointent aussi vers l'activité anti-épileptogénique de la curcumine, un anti-oxydant présent dans le curcuma (12). C’est un antiseptique, un analgésique et un anti-inflammatoire, on peut donc aussi l’utiliser comme désinfectant sur plaies et brûlures, et il possède aussi des vertus antiparasites (4) et a dans une étude, a prouvé réduire la plaque dentaire d'environ 62%, sur une période de 21 jours. Explorons donc certaines de ces vertus en détail et comment elles s’appliquent à nos animaux de compagnie. 1. UTILISATION DU CURCUMA POUR TRAITER DIFFÉRENTS TYPES DE BLESSURES, ABCÈS, BRÛLURES Le curcuma augmente les taux de synthèse du collagène, améliore la contraction des plaies, augmente la résistance tissulaire et la prolifération des cellules autour des plaies. En cas de brûlures ou blessures, vous pouvez aussi utiliser le curcuma pour prévenir ou traiter l’infection et soulager la douleur. On peut mettre de la poudre de curcuma directement sur la plaie pour arrêter les saignements, et faire un cataplasme pour toutes sortes de lésions, coupures, blessures, etc. Le curcuma peut aussi contribuer à réduire la concentration de bactéries telles que Enterococcus Faecalis et E. Coli sur les lésions et inhiber la prolifération de Staphylococcus, études à l’appui. A - BRULURES AU 1ER ET SECOND DEGRÉ : Mélanger 1 cuiller à café de gel d’aloe vera et 1 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma. Appliquer sur la brûlure et couvrir d’une gaze stérile/bandage. Renouveler 2 à 3 fois par jour selon la gravité. B - COUPURES, ABRASIONS, HOTSPOTS, FURONCLES, ABCÈS : Après avoir rasé la zone autour de la lésion, nettoyer avec de l’argent colloïdal (voir détails en cliquant ICI), puis utilisez l’une des options suivantes à base d’huile de lin qui renforce l’action analgésique et antibactérienne du curcuma: Option 1 – Cataplasme Au Curcuma : Mélanger 1 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma bio, avec environ la même quantité d’huile de lin, et appliquer sur la blessure 3 fois par jour le temps nécessaire. Option 2 - Macérât Huileux Au Curcuma (usage externe) : Faire chauffer 230ml d’huile de lin dans une casserole, Couper un petit oignon en fines tranches et les faire frire dans cette huile, jusqu’à ce qu’elles soient bien brunes (mais pas brûlées) et croquantes. Oter les oignons et ajouter 2 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma. Retirer du feu et laisser refroidir à température ambiante. Appliquer sur les lésions à l’aide d’un coton ou d’une gaze stérile 3 fois par jour jusqu’à guérison complète. Conserver ce mélange au frais dans un récipient hermétique. Eviter de laisser l'animal lécher le macérat. 2. UTILISATION DU CURCUMA POUR LES PROBLEMES CUTANES Les vertus antioxydantes et anti-inflammatoires du curcuma se révelent aussi fort utiles dans de nombreux problemes de peau. Il peut ainsi aider a traiter le psoriasis par voie interne (4). Le curcuma peut aussi se révéler utile dans le traitement des pododermatites ou l'on retrouve souvent des souches de bactéries résistantes aux traitements, comme Staph. aureus. La curcumine contenue dans le curcuma inverse la résistance aux médicaments dans cette souche et aide ainsi a la combattre, par voie externe sous forme d'huile de curcuma, par exemple, et par voie interne pour renforcer son action antiseptique. Grace a son contenu en Ar-tumerone, il peut aussi etre utilisé pour traiter différentes formes de teigne comme microsporum canis, et autres types de dermatophytoses (5). De récentes études montrent aussi son activité contre la leishmaniose cutanée, grace encore une fois a la turmérone, une raison de plus d'en donner a votre chien si vous vivez dans l'une des zones endémiques (6). Le curcuma peut aussi intéragir avec d'autres complements pour combattre les réactions immuno-allergiques en réduisant la production de cellules inflammatoires et l'activité des cox et des lox et la migration des cellules immunitaires, et en modulant l'activité des protéines NF-κB. En plus de réduire les médiateurs inflammatoires des prostaglandines, il réduit également les autres médiateurs majeurs des cytokines, un peu comme Apoquel, mais sans les inconvénients (9). Il a aussi un très bon effet anti-inflammatoire sur la peau et peur promouvoir la croissance d'une peau en bonne santé et d’un pelage épais et sain. Enfin, le curcuma possede aussi des vertus acaricides et peut etre utilise en interne comme en externe pour combattre notamment les mites demodex et les sarcoptes. Pour cette utilisation vous avez 2 suggestions de recette : Mélangez une CaS de poudre de curcuma bio avec quelques gouttes de jus de citron pour former une pate, et appliquez sur les lésions. Laissez agir une heure, puis rincez a l'eau tiede, ou... Melangez 1 CaC de poudre de curcuma bio et de poudre de neem auxquelles vous ajouterez suffisamment d'eau pour former une pate. Appliquez sur les lésions et laissez sécher. Rinsez a l'eau tiede. ATTENTION AU PELAGE BLANC : ca tache! 3 - UN ANTI-INFLAMMATOIRE POUR COMBATTRE L’ARTHROSE, L’ARTHRITE, LES ENTORSES, LES FRACTURES, LES HERNIES DISCALES, ETC. L’une des conditions pour lesquelles le curcuma a prouvé être bénéfique est l'arthrose. Le curcuma contient plus de deux douzaines de composants anti-inflammatoires, y compris les inhibiteurs COX-2 sélectifs. L'enzyme COX-2 provoquant la douleur et l'inflammation, ces inhibiteurs bloquent sélectivement cette enzyme. Pour maximiser son potentiel, il est préférable d’ajouter au curcuma du poivre noir et un type de graisse,. Le problème avec la curcumine c’est son faible niveau de biodisponibilité. La plupart de la curcumine ingérée est métabolisée avant d’avoir pu être absorbée par l’organisme. La pipérine augmente donc cette biodisponibilité. C’est peut-être parce que la pipérine inhibe certaines enzymes digestives intestinales. Des études ont été menées sur des humains et des animaux et qui ont révélé que même lorsque 2g de curcumine sont ingérés, ses taux sériques étaient très faibles. Toutefois, lorsque 20mg pipérine ont été rajoutés, la biodisponibilité de la curcumine avait augmenté de 2000%, soit 20 fois (3). L’ajout de graisse à la curcumine lui permet d’être directement absorbée par la circulation sanguine, par l’intermédiaire du système lymphatique, une partie contournant ainsi le foie. Pour le curcuma, comme la pipérine, il est très important de sélectionner des ingrédients de qualité. Les petits flacons saupoudreurs vendus en supermarchés sont la pire qualité que vous puissiez trouver. Outre le fait que leur efficacité est limitée, la curcumine en a souvent été extraite à l’aide de solvants, pour la confection des gélules de curcuma. Choisissez du curcuma bio, et de même pour le poivre noir. J’achète du poivre sauvage de Madagascar que je mouds moi-même, d’excellente qualité, qui ne pique pas et très agréable au goût. Une autre façon de stimuler l'absorption de la curcumine est de la consommer dans les aliments entiers, comme dans la racine de curcuma fraiche, parce que les huiles naturelles présentes dans la racine de curcuma peuvent améliorer la biodisponibilité de la curcumine de 7 à 8 fois (mais quand même, contre 20 fois en poudre avec l’ajout de poivre). La recette de la pâte de curcuma au bas de cette page contient tous les ingrédients nécessaires. Pour fournir à votre animal de compagnie une autre forme de soulagement, en cas de fracture, entorse, hernies discales, etc. vous pouvez aussi tremper un morceau de gaze ou un linge propre dans un macérât huileux de curcuma, l'appliquer sur la zone douloureuse, et le sécuriser avec un bandage pour la nuit : Faire chauffer 230ml d’huile de lin dans une casserole, couper un petit oignon en fines tranches et les faire frire dans cette huile, jusqu’à ce qu’elles soient bien brunes (mais pas brûlées) et croquantes. Oter les oignons et ajouter 2 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma. Retirer du feu et laisser refroidir à température ambiante. Conserver ce mélange dans un récipient hermétique. Si vous n’avez pas tous ces ingrédients sous la main, vous pouvez tout simplement faire une pate épaisse avec de la poudre de curcuma et de l’eau, placer une gaze stérile sur la zone à traiter, et y appliquer cette pâte. Couvrez avec un bandage. L’Ideal est de pouvoir le laisser toute la nuit. 4 - TUMEURS BENIGNES ET CANCERS DE LA PEAU J’essaierai de revenir sur ce paragraphe plus en détail, mais je voulais d’ores et déjà partager une recette intérasssante pour traiter les cancers de la peau : A - Baume au curcuma : 1 cuiller à café d’huile de noix de coco ¼ de cuiller à café de curcuma en poudre ¼ de cuiller à café de bicarbonate de soude Quelques gouttes d’huile de ricin Mélanger ces ingrédients pour former une pâte, l’appliquer sur une gaze stérile et poser en cataplasme sur la tumeur. Maintenir avec un bandage et laisser agir toute la nuit pour les grosses tumeurs. Pour les petites tumeurs simplement appliquer ce mélange sur la lésions 3 à 5 fois par jour. Photos Avant/Après en cliquant ICI B- Baume au curcuma de Karen Becker Pour les tumeurs dites solides (ou la peau est intacte). Attention ne jamais utiliser cette formule si la peau n’est pas intacte car ça serait très douloureux pour l’animal. 2 Cas de Curcuma bio en poudre 1 CaS d’huile végétale bio (huile de coco par exemple) 1 CaS de jus de citron (anti-inflammatoire et antitumoral) 1 Ca S de sel Mélanger ces ingrédients et appliquer sur la tumeur aussi souvent que possible. C – Gel au curcuma de Karen Becker Pour les tumeurs ou la peau est endommagée, ouverte, ulcérée, etc. 1 CaS curcuma bio en poudre 1 CaS de miel de manuka 1 capsule broméline 1 Cas de gel d’aloé frais Mélanger ces ingrédients et appliquer sur la tumeur aussi souvent que possible. D- Recette du baume « SUPERHEAL SKIN & GROWTH CARE » de Augistine Approved Décidément les Australiens sont capables d’accomplir des miracles avec le curcuma ! Ce baume est assez spectaculaire a en croire les témoignages d’utilisateurs. Le baume Superheal peut être utilisé sur toutes formes d’excroissances et tumeurs de la peau, comme les verrues, les lipomes, les acrochordons, les mastocytomes, et même des tumeurs mammaires, etc. Les photos Avant/Après sont assez impressionnantes. 1/3 (en grammes) de curcuma en poudre bio 1/3 d’huile de noix de coco bio, vierge/extra vierge et pressée à froid 1/3 de lécithine de soja bio en poudre Mélangez le curcuma et la lécithine, puis ajoutez l’huile de coco pour former une pâte. Versez dans un bocal en verre. Se conserve au réfrigérateur plusieurs semaines. La pâte risque d’être un peu dure et difficile a étaler au sortir du réfrigérateur, il est conseillé de prélever la quantité dont vous avez besoin et de laisser 5mn a température ambiante avant de l’utiliser. Etalez la pate sur la lesion/tumeur/excroissance puis appliquez un bandage dessus. Laissez agir 24 heures, puis recommencez le processus pendant 7 jours Laissez a l’air sans rien pendant 24 heures Si la masse n’est pas tombée au bout de ce temps, renouvelez l’application 2 a 5 jours de plus ou jusqu’à ce qu’elle tombe. Le zone risque d’etre a vif a ce moment la, il conviendra donc de veiller a garder la zone propre. Pour les lésions de grande taille, la supervision de votre vétérinaire peur s'avérer nécessaire. Il n’y a pas d’alternative pour la lecithine de soja, son but étant de faciliter l’absorption de la pâte par l’épiderme. 5 - DIGESTION Le curcuma favorise la production de bile, améliorant ainsi les fonctions digestives des lipases qui digère les graisses, la chymotrypsine - une peptidase digestive de la famille des protéases - qui digère les protéines, et de l'amylase qui digère les hydrates de carbone. Il faut tout de même noter que dans l’étude qui démontrait ces faits, une combinaison de curcuma, piment rouge, poivre noir, cumin et d'oignon avait été utilisée, presque doublant la sécrétion de bile et augmentant l'activité de la lipase de 40 % et l'activité de la chymotrypsine de 77%. Cette même activité contribue à détoxifier le foie, aide à maintenir un système digestif sain et réduire les ballonnements. Le curcuma est aussi utile pour combattre les problèmes de santé causés par la bactérie Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), tels que la gastrite, l'ulcère gastroduodénal, et le cancer gastrique. Selon une autre étude de 2009, la curcumine a prouvé stopper efficacement la croissance de H. pylori in vitro, indépendamment de la constitution génétique des souches. Pour tous ces problèmes digestifs, utilisez la pâte de curcuma et la grille de dosage fournie avec la recette au bas de cette page, mais ne donnez jamais seul. Vous pouvez le mélanger à de la nourriture humide, du yaourt nature, ou mieux du kéfir de lait ! 6. APPAREIL URINAIRE D’après certains herboristes en Inde, une vessie hyperactive peut etre due a une inflammation, sans pour autant qu’il y ait infection. Une substance appelée NF kappa-B est l'un des principaux déclencheurs de l'inflammation de la vessie et le curcuma empêche le corps de le fabriquer. En tant que puissant antioxydant, le curcuma peut donc aider à prévenir l'infection urinaire en premier lieu, mais aussi grâce à son composant connu sous le nom de curcumine. Suivez le dosage au bas de la recette de la pate de curcuma. En cas d’infection urinaire avérée vous pouvez aussi faire à votre animal une infusion de curcuma : Faites bouillir 250ml d’eau Ajoutez-y une cuillère à café de curcuma Laissez refroidir et servez a votre chien avec un peu de miel bio pour le goût et les bienfaits. Cette même recette peut être utilisée pour traiter les infections du sang. 7. AMELIORE LA FONCTION THYROIDIENNE Il semblerait en effet. Des études sont en cours sur ce sujet, mais certains résultats et exemples cliniques sembleraient le confirmer. Une étude menée au Pakistan sur un certain nombre de sujets souffrant d'un goitre (inflammation de la glande thyroïde en 2015 semble aussi pointer dans cette direction (7). Plus précisément et en ce qui concerne nos 4-pattes, l'histoire de Wunder (8), une rottweiler dont les niveaux de T4 étaient toujours au minimum et qu'elle devait faire controler régulierement. En 2013, avant la prise de curcuma, sa T4 était a 9 En 2014, quelques mois apres la prise de curcuma, sa T4 était a 15,9 En 2016 apres 3 ans de curcuma, sa T4 était a 28,4 COMMENT CHOSIR UN CURCUMA DE QUALITÉ ? La sempiternelle question ! Dans la recette ci-dessous, je déconseille le curcuma en pot, vendu sans le rayon épices de votre supermarché, parce que celui-ci se compose souvent des résidus de curcuma, après extraction de son composant actif, la curcumine ou extrait de curcuma que vous trouvez en gélules. Non seulement cette poudre ne contient pour ainsi dire plus de ce composant actif, mais l’extraction de l’extrait pouvant s’effectuer à l’aide solvants chimiques, elle peut contenir des résidus. Comme si cela ne suffisait pas, pour augmenter le volume du produit final certains fabricants peu scrupuleux rajoutent des choses peu ragoutantes qui n’ont rien à y faire (sciure de bois, craie, chromate de plomb, cadmium, jaune de métanile, etc. Pour exemple, en 2013 la Food and Drugs Administration américaine a trouvé des traces de plomb dans une marque de curcuma en provenance du Bengladesh, et de nouveau en aout 2016. N’allez pas croire que les gélules de curcuma sont indemnes de toute contamination car en 2009, une marque de suppléments en provenance du Mexique a révélé contenir du nimésulide, un puissant anti-inflammatoire qui cause d’importants dommages au foie, et banni dans de nombreux pays. Même lorsqu’on achète un produit certifié bio, il y a toujours un risque, car malheureusement, malgré la réglementation des produits producteurs personne n’est à l’abri d’un acte de corruption. C’est l’une des raisons pour lesquelles je préfère le curcuma destiné à la consommation humaine, qui font l’objet d’un contrôle plus rigoureux. SOUS QUELLE FORME ADMINISTRER LE CURCUMA À VOTRE ANIMAL DE COMPAGNIE PAR VOIE INTERNE? 1. SOUS FORME DE SAUCE (IDEALE SUR LES CROQUETTES) Mettez la quantité de poudre de curcuma désirée dans une tasse (prenons 1 cuiller à café comme exemple), donner un tour de moulin à poivre, une cuiller à café d’huile d’olive ou de noix de coco, puis remplissez la tasse aux 1/3 d’eau chaude, et laissez refroidir. Versez sur les croquettes. 2. SOUS FORME D’EPS (EXTRAIT DE PLANTE STANDARDISÉ) Les EPS sont des extraits fluides de plantes à usage pharmaceutique, issues de l’agriculture biologique, sans sucre ni alcool. Ils contiennent une très forte concentration et ne doivent pas être utilisés sur une longue durée. Le dosage est de 1ml par 5kg de poids corporel, le total ne devant pas excéder 5ml pour un gros chien. Cela veut dire que si votre chien pèse 50kg, la dose sera la même que pour un chien de 25kg. Sous cette forme, il est conseillé de faire l'objet d'un suivi d'un vétérinaire naturopathe, et de donner qu'en cure, car c'est une forme assez concentrée. 3 -SOUS FORME DE PÂTE Recette au bas de cette page. L'avantage de cette formule c'est qu'on peut donner tous les jours, et a vie, il n'y a pas d'accoutumance, et cela n'est pas une dose assez forte pour poser probleme. LA POLEMIQUE SUR L’AJOUT DE POIVRE NOIR La question du poivre revient souvent pour les animaux sujets aux problèmes gastriques, et là encore les mythes ont la vie dure. Voici donc la réponse du Dr. English (vétérinaire) à ce sujet : « La plupart des problèmes digestifs sont le résultat d'un manque d'acide chlorhydrique plutôt qu’un excès. Le poivre noir stimule les papilles et avertit l'estomac d’augmenter la sécrétion d'acide chlorhydrique, améliorant la digestion. Sans des quantités suffisantes, la nourriture non digérée peut rester dans l'estomac pendant de longues périodes, entraînant des brûlures d'estomac et l'indigestion. Les aliments non digérés peuvent également passer dans les intestins, où nourrir les mauvaises bactéries, produisant des gaz, de l'irritation, la diarrhée ou la constipation. Le poivre noir peut agir comme diurétique, réduire les ballonnements dans le tractus intestinal où il favorise la santé digestive grâce à ses effets antioxydants. » Certes l’étude prouvant ce fait a été réalisée sur des humains et il est effectivement possible que l’action ne soit pas la même chez le chien, et il n’y a encore eu aucune étude de faite sur les chiens ou les chats spécifiquement. Sur cette question, Doug répond : « Je sais que nous n'avons pas de définition concernant l’effet spécifique sur l'absorption chez les chiens et c'est la raison même pour laquelle j'ai commencé la page TUG – pour y réunir des preuves anecdotiques. Avec 211 000 membres qui l'utilisent activement, il n'y a pas d'anecdotes sur la pipérine causant de vrais problèmes, et le poivre en lui-même est un très bon aliment et pas seulement un condiment pour la saveur. » Lors d’une interview sur ce sujet il a répondu : « La pipérine dans le poivre aide le curcuma à rester dans le sang plus longtemps sans être métabolisé et éliminé. » « …. La pipérine est un extrait (et généralement très concentré) de poivre noir entier (piper nigrum). Donc, ajouter du poivre noir fraîchement moulu à votre curcuma n'est pas la même chose que d'ingérer de la pipérine hautement concentrée… » (11) Le poivre noir contient aussi un cannabinoïde, le caryophyllène (ß-caryophyllène sesquiterpène) qui affecte seulement les récepteurs CB2 cannabinoïdes, soulageant ainsi la douleur, inhibant l’inflammation, et stimulant le système immunitaire. Par mesure de précautions, si votre chat ou chien présente une pathologie de colon irritable, MICI, etc. n’ajoutez pas de poivre. CONTRE INDICATIONS ET EFFETS SECONDAIRES Le curcuma n'est pas compatible avec certaines formes de chimio, vérifiez donc avec votre vétérinaire oncologue si votre animal suit ce protocole. Il est aussi à éviter en cas d'obstruction des canaux biliaires. Eviter aussi son utilisation en conjonction avec d'autres draineurs hépatiques pour ne pas mettre le foie a trop lourde contribution. Il n’est pas compatible avec les radiations, car il protège le corps contre leurs effets nocifs (il est question ici de radiothérapie, pas de radiologie, ça n'interfère donc pas avec une radio des os). Le curcuma peut réduire la résistance à l’insuline. Antidépresseur naturel, il peut donc augmenter les effets de certaines drogues comme le Prozac pour animaux. La pipérine dans la pâte de curcuma peut aussi interférer avec certains narcotiques, par conséquent à ne pas donner des animaux prenant un tel traitement. Ne pas donner de curcuma aux animaux sous traitement pour des pathologies comme l’épilepsie, ou autres maladies neurodégénératives sans avis médical. Le curcuma peut aussi interférer avec les antibiotiques à base de fluor quinolone. Il est suggéré de l'utiliser avec précautions, ou de ne pas en prendre en conjonction avec certains anticoagulants ou supplément ayant comme lui des vertus anticoagulantes, donc à vérifier avec votre vétérinaire naturopathe. J’insiste sur le naturopathe car beaucoup de vétérinaires conventionnels ont peu ou pas de connaissances dans ce domaine, et se contentent de dire que c’est un anticoagulant, en exagérant les effets. En cas de fracture, ou d'une intervention chirurgicale comme l'ostéotomie, consultez votre veterinaire. Le curcuma est une alternative naturelle aux analgésiques pour le traitement de l'inflammation. Cependant, l'inflammation est une partie essentielle du processus de guérison des fractures, et par conséquent, si un anti-inflammatoire n'est pas prescrit par votre vétérinaire, évitez donc le curcuma qui pourrait antagoniser la repousse des os. Dans une telle situation le dosage est important, d'ou la necessité de consulter votre vétérinaire naturopathe. À cause de son effet détoxifiant, le curcuma peut être la cause de selles molles ou de maux d’estomac. Réduisez la dose à 1/8ème de celle prévue pendant au moins une semaine, puis augmentez la dose très progressivement. RECETTE DE LA PATE DE CURCUMA Recette élaborée par Doug English Pour faire une bonne pâte de curcuma, il faut du curcuma en poudre, un corps gras, et du poivre noir. 1. La poudre de curcuma : Attention, le curcuma ça tache ! Il est aussi important de trouver du curcuma de bonne qualité car beaucoup de curcuma bon marché contient très peu de curcumine, elle a été ôtée pour fabriquer des gélules et les résidus vendus à bas prix. Un curcuma de bonne qualité contient entre 3 et 5% de curcumine, minimum. Vous pourrez en trouver du bon vendu en vrac dans les épiceries ethniques. Si vous n'êtes pas surs de la qualité, alors achetez du curcuma bio dans une boutique ou un site spécialisé. 2. Un corps gras : Le curcuma doit être dissout pour être digéré, or il n'est soluble que dans l'huile ou l'alcool, d'où la nécessité de lui ajouter de l'huile pour qu'il soit absorbé. Selon l'animal pour lequel la pâte est destinée, on préfèrera une huile végétale comme l'huile d'olive, de lin, de noix de coco, bio, vierge et pressée à froid, qui résistent le mieux l'oxydation. Je déconseille l'huile de lin, car elle se dégrade rapidement et cette oxydation peut avoir des conséquences négatives. L'huile de noix de coco se figeant en dessous de 24 degrés Celsius, c'est celle que je préfère et c’est aussi celle qui est la plus efficace d’après Doug English.S'il n'est pas dissout, le curcuma passera dans l'appareil digestif sans être absorbé, n'aura aucun bienfait et risque d'irriter le colon. 3. Le poivre noir : Le poivre noir contient de la pipérine, un alcaloïde qui joue 2 rôles dans la recette. Outre le fait qu'il multiplie la biodisponibilité du curcuma, il permet aussi au foie d'en extraire la curcumine (le composant actif) plus lentement, lui permettant de passer dans la circulation sanguine. Ce petit ajout à lui tout seul multiplie les effets du curcuma par 20. Il est préférable d'utiliser du poivre en grain et de le moudre grossièrement juste avant de l'ajouter à la pâte. Vous pouvez moudre le poivre à l'avance et le mettre aussitôt au congélateur pour l'utiliser avec votre prochaine \"fournée\" de pate de curcuma. N'utilisez pas de poivre pré-moulu, vendu en grande surface, c'est un sous-produit qui contient peu ou pas de pipérine, et n'a donc aucune valeur ; le poivre pré-moulu même bio ne contient plus de pipérine non plus. Achetez du poivre en grains, bio bien entendu. 4. La cannelle de Ceylan : L'ajout de cannelle est facultatif, mais outre le fait qu'il augmente l'effet anti-inflammatoire du curcuma, la cannelle aide aussi a réduire ou éliminer l'odeur de pipi de chat que certains chiens ont lorsqu'ils consomment du curcuma. Il est crucial d'utiliser de la vraie cannelle, celle de Ceylan \"Cinnamomum Verum\" aussi dite \"cinnamomum zeylanicum\", mais surtout pas celle du supermarché, la cannelle de Chine \"Cinnamomum Cassia\". La différence reside dans le fait que celle de Chine a une forte teneur en coumarine, alors que celle de Ceylan n'en contient quasiment pas. La coumarine est toxique, en général, et pour les chiens en particulier, car elle inhibe les enzymes responsables du recyclage de la vitamine K, ce qui compromet certains facteurs de coagulation. Ajoutée au curcuma qui a déja des vertus anti-coagulantes, ca n'est pas une bonne idée. D'ailleurs la coumarine entre dans la composition de certains raticides. INGREDIENTS 65g de curcuma en poudre bio, de bonne qualité (contient entre 3 et 5% de curcumine, la teneur la plus courante) ou 200g de racine de curcuma fraiche 1/2 à 3/4 de cuiller à café de poivre noir fraîchement moulu 125ml d'eau 70ml d'huile d'olive, de lin ou de noix de coco bio (on ne peut pas utiliser n’importe quel type d’huile, les effets ne sont pas les mêmes) 1/2 cuiller à café de de cannelle de Ceylan - OPTIONNEL. On se sait pas si c'est l'effet détoxifiant, mais certains animaux sentent parfois l'urine, lorsqu'ils commencent a prendre du curcuma, la cannelle aide à eliminer cette odeur. Je n'ai jamais eu le problème avec mes chiens. Assurez vous d'utiliser de la cannelle de Ceylan (Cinnamomum verum = Cinnamomum zeylanicum), pas celle de Chine (Cinnamomum cassia) vendue en supermarché qui n'a souvent de la cannelle que ne nom mais plus les vertus, car elle contient de hauts niveaux de coumarine, toxique pour le foie et peut aussi etre la cause d'allergies. PREPARATION Mélangez le curcuma avec l'eau dans une casserole et remuez. Ça va tout de suite épaissir. Mettez sur feu moyen et rajoutez un peu d’eau, juste assez pour légèrement liquéfier et continuez de mélanger. Des que votre mélange va chauffer, il va épaissir de nouveau, vous rajoutez donc encore un peu d’eau, et vous laissez de nouveau épaissir. Au total il faut chauffer le curcuma de 7 à 8mn minimum. Il doit avoir la consistance d’une purée épaisse, s’il est trop liquide, continuez de le chauffer un peu jusqu’à ce qu’il épaississe suffisamment. Ajoutez alors le poivre noir fraîchement moulu, puis l'huile. Mélangez et versez le tout dans un pot avec un couvercle, puis mettez au réfrigérateur. La pâte se garde ainsi 3 à 4 semaines, mais on recommande de l’utiliser sous 2 semaines, car passé ce délai, elle commence à perdre de son efficacité. On peut aussi la conserver au congélateur jusqu’à 4 mois. Si vous utilisez du curcuma frais, comme il a une moins forte concentration de curcumine, il faut en mettre très peu d’eau puisqu'il en contient déjà une forte teneur, et qu'il contient 3 fois moins de curcumine. Il faudra aussi le chauffer/cuire davantage pour libérer ses antioxydants. DOSAGE Le dosage dépend davantage du besoin de votre animal que de son poids. Par exemple, ma chienne de 28kg est à 1 cuiller à café par jour depuis un an et cela semble lui suffire,mais quand je vois qu'elle et un peu raide parce qu'elle a trop fait le bourrin, je lui en donne 3 ou 4 pendant quelques jours. Comme pour tout supplément, il faut commencer par une toute petite dose, non seulement pour habiter votre animal au goût (certains l’adorent d’autres ont besoin de s’y habituer progressivement), ainsi que vérifier si ça n’a pas d’effets indésirables sur leur appareil digestif ; c’est rare mais ça arrive. La colonne « jusqu’à » n’est ici qu’à titre indicatif, pour vous donner une idée de ce qu’on peut devoir donner en cas de symptômes prononcés, mais ne veut en aucun cas dire que vous devez donner autant, ou même vous arrêter là. Certains animaux peuvent avoir besoin de beaucoup plus, et d'autres d'un peu moins, vous pouvez élire de doubler ou tripler cette dose (progressivement bien entendu) si besoin est. L'idéal est de répartir cette quantité en 2 prises par jour pour un effet cumulatif.

Il vaut aussi mieux augmenter la dose progressivement pour ne pas choquer leur appareil digestif. L’idéal est de répartir la dose en 2 ou 3 fois par jour. Les résultats ne sont pas garantis a 100%, mais très souvent, le manque d’efficacité est dû ou à un curcuma de piètre qualité ou une dose insuffisante.

Cela n’est donc pas un hasard si les feuilles de cet arbre possèdent tant de bienfaits, tant pour nous que pour nos animaux domestiques. La feuille d’olivier est connue pour ses nombreuses vertus, grace notamment à son contenu en oleuropéine, et 400 fois plus d’antioxydants que la vitamine C. Bien que contenant un plus fort pourcentage en oleuropéine, la feuille d’olivier en poudre sous forme de gélules est moins bien absorbée par le corps que la teinture mère ou de thé, et peut aussi être la cause de problèmes gastriques. Ces gélules contiennent aussi très souvent des excipients comme le talc et le stéarate de magnésium, et cela n’est pas toujours précisé sur les étiquettes. Certaines gélules contiennent un mélange de feuilles en poudre et d’extrait de feuille en poudre ; cette forme est préférable et mieux absorbée. Les feuilles séchées peuvent contenir jusqu’à 9% d’oleuropéine, alors que l’extrait en poudre contient aux alentours de 20%. La forme la mieux absorbée est la teinture mère. Et l’alcool, direz-vous ? Ce ne sont pas quelques gouttes d’alcool dans un remède qui vont rendre votre animal de compagnie alcoolique ou l’enivrer, mais il existe d’autres alternatives pour ceux ne sont pas convaincus. Vous pouvez aussi dissoudre la quantité requise dans quelques gouttes d'eau chaude (pas bouillante), et laisser refroidir quelques minutes, cela aura pour effet d'évaporer l'alcool. SES BIENFAITS SUR NOS ANIMAUX Antiviral, antibactérien, antifongique (infections urinaires, candidas, staphs, levures) Stimule la production de cellules osseuses Puissant antioxydant Fait baisser la tension artérielle/vasodilatateur Anti-Arythmique Antihémorragique Aide a reduire la glycemie, le cholesterol, Soutient le système immunitaire Stimule le métabolisme Fébrifuge Vermifuge (en particulier la giardose) (1) Soulage les dermatites grâce à son effet détoxifiants Réduit les dommages oxydatifs dans le tractus gastro-intestinal Puissant anti-inflammatoire (fonctionne sur l'arthrose notamment) Combat le cancer (foie, prostate, colon, peau, mammaire) Lors de mes recherches pour la redaction de cet article, j'ai découvert qu'on pouvait notamment utiliser l'extrait de feuilles d'olivier dans le traitement de la FeLV et la FIV. PRECAUTIONS D’EMPLOI ET EFFETS SECONDAIRES Peut interférer avec certaines formes de chimio. Peut provoquer la réaction de Erx ou Herxheimer (en mourant les bactéries libèrent des toxines, donnant lieu à des symptômes allant des démangeaisons, jusqu’à empirer les symptômes de la maladie. Bien qu’il booste le système immunitaire, l’EFO contenant de très hauts niveaux d’antioxydants, il aurait des donc des effets positifs sur les maladies auto immunes, mais comme il existe peu de data sur ce sujet, dans le doute consultez un vétérinaire naturopathe. RECETTE DE L’EXTRAIT DE FEUILLE D’OLIVIER Si vous résidez dans une région méditerranéenne, vous avez ce qu’il faut sur le seuil de votre porte, mais assurez-vous que les arbres n’ont pas été du tout traités. Il ne faut pas non plus choisir un arbre dans une zone dont l’air est pollué, comme en bordure de route. C’est primordial car outre les vertus de la feuille d’olivier, vous en extirperez aussi les polluants ! Sélectionnez un type d’olivier européen, ce sont ceux dont le feuilles sont riches en oleuropéine, ce qui n’est pas les cas des oliviers venant de Chine. Cueillez les feuilles de préférence en milieu de matinée, lorsqu’elles n’ont plus aucune trace d’humidité ou de rosée matinale. Ne conservez que les feuilles saines sans aucune tache ni défaut, et préparez votre teinture dans l’heure qui suit la cueillette. Vous pouvez acheter des feuilles séchées, elles feront un produit acceptable, mais bien inférieur aux feuilles fraîches en qualité et vertus médicinales. Là encore, vérifiez la provenance. Vous aurez besoin de : Un bocal en avec fermeture hermétique, comme un bocal à conserve ou bocal à confitures. Surtout pas de plastique ! Un morceau de linge en coton propre et qui ne contient aucun résidu d’assouplisseur ou de javel, ou un coton/mousseline à fromage. Des petits flacons compte-goutte en verre coloré (ambré ou bleu) Une forme d’alcool à 40º comme de la vodka, de l’alcool pour fruits, du moment que c’est un alcool sans goût, la seule exception étant le rhum blanc (250ml par 100g de feuilles fraîches, le double si ce sont des feuilles sèches), ou Du vinaigre de cidre en même quantité. La solution obtenue devra macérer beaucoup plus longtemps. Après n’avoir conservé que les feuilles sans défauts, hachez-les menu ou passez-les à la moulinette. Mettez-les dans votre bocal en verre, préalablement lavé et stérilisé, et couvrez avec l’alcool. Fermez hermétiquement, et rangez dans un endroit sombre à température ambiante, mais où vous ne l’oublierez pas car il faut secouer le bocal tous les jours pendant la durée de la macération. Je mets mon bocal dans un étui à champagne sur mon comptoir de cuisine, avec un torchon sur le dessus du bocal pour comble le vide, comme ça je pense à le secouer tous les jours. Laissez macérer minimum 3 semaines si votre teinture est à base d’alcool, et 6 si elle est au vinaigre de cidre. UTILISATION En interne : 1 goutte de teinture mère par 3kg de poids corporel, par jour. Très amère, il vous faudra la diluer avec quelque chose pour couvrir le gout. Usage topique : Peut être utilisé pur sur la peau, pour soulager l’eczéma, les infections cutanées, les levures, etc. On peut aussi l’ajouter au shampoing, à de l’huile de noix de coco, du gel d’aloe Herbalgem Bourgeons d'Olivier Feuilles d'olivier - Teinture mere Herbiolys Feuilles d'olivier - gelules Sources : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876915 Toutes les œuvres présentes sur ce site appartiennent exclusivement à l’auteur (sauf mention contraire) aux termes des articles L111-1 et L112-2 du code de la propriété intellectuelle.Toute reproduction, diffusion publique, usage commercial sont, par conséquent, interdits sans autorisation du ou des titulaires des droits.

Nous avons recueilli Yulia lorsqu’elle n’avait qu’une dizaine de semaines et avait été abandonnée dans la campagne, livrée à elle-même pendant quelques jours. Elle a survécu en se nourrissant de tout ce qu’elle trouvait, baies sauvages comprises. C’est comme cela qu’un jour en promenade, je l’ai vue manger des baies rouges que je suis empressée de lui faire cracher au cas où elles seraient toxiques. De retour à la maison, je m’étais renseignée et découvert qu’il s’agissait de cenelles, non seulement un fruit comestible, mais plein de bienfaits pour nos chiens. Elle semble connaître celles qui sont comestibles et celles qui ne le sont pas. La cenelle est le fruit de l'aubépine, un excellent cardiotonique. Sa capacité à faire lentement baisser la tension artérielle est documentée, bien que le mécanisme de son action soit incertain. L’aubépine ne bloque pas les canaux calciques et n’agit pas non plus comme diurétique. En fait c’est un excellent moyen de réduire la tension artérielle même pour les animaux diabétiques ou ceux qui ont des problèmes de reins. Les feuilles, les bourgeons, les fleurs et les baies d’aubépine améliorent la fonction générale du cœur, stabilisent et renforcent un rythme cardiaque faible ou irrégulier. L’aubépine est si performante que des études démontrent qu’elle est tout aussi efficace que la digitaline, sans ses effets nocifs. Il n'y a pas de danger d'effets secondaires ou danger cumulatif et elle peut aider à réduire la dose de digitaline de moitié. L’aubépine est riche en flavonoïdes et en antioxydants qui sont bons pour le cœur et les vaisseaux sanguins à bien des égards, leurs effets anti-inflammatoires puissants relaxant les vaisseaux sanguins. Leur action anti- microbienne stoppe les infections comme celles des gencives, qui peuvent nuire au cœur. Ses flavonoïdes – le pigment rouge des baies d'aubépine – sont le composant le plus responsable de son effet tonique, et qui soutiennent le bon fonctionnement du système immunitaire et du foie. La cenelle est le fruit qui contient la plus grande source naturelle de flavonoïdes. Enfin, elle contient aussi beaucoup de vitamine C. Elle est bénéfique pour les chiens âgés, ceux souffrant d'insuffisance cardiaque, ceux qui ont des anomalies cardiaques à la suite d’un traitement contre les vers de cœur, une infection ou un traitement de chimiothérapie, mais aussi pour les chiens de travail. Elle renforce l'appétit et la digestion, et aide aussi la circulation sanguine du foie et des reins. Pour compléter les besoins supplémentaires d'animaux plus âgés, elle peut être donné en combinaison avec : Le ginkgo ou l'achillée millefeuille pour renforcer les parois des capillaires et améliorer l'approvisionnement en sang vers les reins et les extrémités, L'ail pour le soutien du système immunitaire, La luzerne et le trèfle rouge pour nourrir le sang, augmenter l'appétit et les niveaux d'énergie, La feuille de pissenlit pour aider à l'élimination des excès d'eau, L’avoine fleurie (sommités d’avoine fleurie) comme un tonique du système nerveux. LISTE DES BIENFAITS Pour Le Cœur : Régularise la tension artérielle, Accroît l'efficacité de l'action de pompage du cœur et renforce le muscle cardiaque, Regularise le rythme cardiaque, Dilate les artères coronaires, Prévient les maladies cardiaques, les crises cardiaques et les AVC, Agit comme sédatif, réduire l’anxiété et la sensation d’oppression, combat l’insomnie, Aide à réparer les dommages causés par les vers de cœur, après le traitement. Pour l'Appareil Digestif : Traite les indigestions, la diarrhée, les maux d’estomac, Traite contre le ténia, Protège le foie lors de crises cardiaques, détoxifie le foie. Pour La Santé Générale : Aide à la perte de poids en évitant la rétention d'eau, Soulage l’asthme en augmentant la capacité naturelle du corps à utiliser l'oxygène, Soutient le système immunitaire. ADMINISTRATION Tisane : La tisane d’aubépine se fait par trempage de 2 deux cuillerées à café de feuilles et de fleurs séchées dans une tasse d'eau bouillante pendant vingt minutes. Infusion : Une infusion d’aubépine se fait par macération de 30g de fleurs et de feuilles séchées ou 30g de cenelles séchées dans un litre d'eau bouillante pendant au moins quatre heures, que l’on laisse refroidir. Teinture Mère : La teinture mère d'aubépine se fait en macérant des cenelles séchée dans de l’alcool de fruit pendant au moins 6 mois, ou jusqu'à ce que l’alcool devienne rouge. Macérat Hydroglycériné : 20g de cenelles bien mûres, 50ml de glycérine végétale, 50ml d’eau, 0,6% d’EPP de qualité alimentaire. Mettre tous les ingrédients dans un bocal hermétique et laisser macérer à l’abri de la lumière et à température ambiante 2 à 3 semaines. Le macérait doit avoir pris la couleur des baies. Filtrez et pressez à travers une gaze (se conserve 6 mois au réfrigérateur). Vinaigre De Cenelles : 450ml de vinaigre de cidre bio non pasteurisé + le même volume en cenelles. Mettre les cenelles dans un grand bocal, verser le vinaigre dessus et fermer hermétiquement. Laisser macérer au moins 3 semaines à l’abri de la lumière et à température ambiante, et secouer tous les jours. Filtrer et doser à raison de : 1 cac de 1 à 5kg de poids corporel 2 cac de 5 a 15kg 3 cac de 15 a 50kg 4 cac 50kg + Cenelles entières : 2 cuillers à café de cenelles fraîches ou séchées par kg de nourriture, par jour. Macérat concentré (Herbalgem ou Phytogem) : 1 goutte/10kg de poids corporel, 2 a 3 fois par jour, en commencant par la moitié de cette dose et en augmentant progressivement ou la quantité ou le nombre de prises.

Outre leur contenu en fibres et en vitamines, ils contiennent aussi des minéraux, mais surtout des antioxydants qui jouent un rôle essentiel dans la prévention de nombreuses maladies, y compris le cancer. Puisque nous sommes en été, le fruit-légume dont j’aimerais vous parler c’est la pastèque. Passons sur le fait que son prix est dérisoire, c’est un fruit intéressant entre autres grâce à son contenu en lycopène, un pigment caroténoïde et puissant antioxydant qui combat les radicaux libres. Parmi ses vertus on compte : Protection contre les toxines contenues dans certains pesticides Inversion de certains dommages causés aux glandes endocriniennes et au foie (1) et (2). Des vertus antifongiques et antibactériennes qui ont fait l’objet d’études, notamment dans le traitement de la gingivite et de candida albican (3) et (4). Prevention et traitement des infections urinaires Traitement des calculs rénaux Prevention de l’hypertrophie de la prostate Vertus anticancéreuses ((prostate, poumons, estomac, pancréas, colon et rectum, œsophages, bouche, sein et cervix) (5) Protection contre certaines maladies du cœur Retardement de certains troubles oculaires liés à l’age. Cela ne veut pas pour autant dire que donner une tranche de pastèque a votre chien toute les jours va le guérir du cancer ou l’empêcher de faire de la gingivite, mais que cela peut contribuer à une meilleure santé en général et surtout en été c’est un excellent moyen de l’hydrater. Autres composants intéressants de la pastèque ce sont les acides aminés comme la citrulline qui est convertie en arginine par les reins. Cet acide aminé est important pour la santé cardiaque et le système immunitaire, mais a aussi fait l’objet de recherches montrant ses valeurs thérapeutiques potentielles dans de nombreuses conditions dont : La démence La fatigue L’hypertension Le diabète La fatigue musculaire La performance athlétique La pastèque contient aussi du tryptophane, de l’arginine, de l'acide glutamique et de la lysine, des acides aminés précurseurs métaboliques de la sérotonine, un neurotransmetteur qui joue un rôle important dans la régulation du moral et de l’humeur. Autrement dit, la pastèque c’est bon pour le moral ! Ce fruit-légume n’est pas le seul à posséder de nombreuses vertus, mais là où il diffère de beaucoup autres, c’est que comme avec le cochon : tout est bon dans le melon (d’eau) ! Comme de nombreuses personnes, vous devez certainement jeter les graines et la peau, ce qui est une grosse erreur ! La peau du melon d’eau est encore plus riche en lycopène et en citrulline que sa chair, et elle contient aussi de la chlorophylle, et des vitamines A, B1, B2, B3, B6, et des oligo-éléments comme le calcium, le fer, le magnésium le phosphore, le potassium et le zinc. Les graines sont-elles-aussi comestibles et riches de ces mêmes vitamines, minéraux et acides aminés, et contiennent beaucoup d’ga-6 (30g pour 100g de graines séchées. Profitez de l’été, et gardez les graines au congélateur, vous leur trouverez une utilisation cet hiver. VALEURS NUTRITIONNELLES EFFETS SECONDAIRES ET PRECAUTIONS La pasteque etant riche en glucide, la question peut se poser si c’est une si bonne idée de l’inclure a l’alimentation de votre chien. La bonne nouvelle c’est qu’elle est aussi tres riche en fibres et ces fibres ralentissent l’assimilation des glucides par le système digestif de votre chien, evitant ainsi la montée brutale de la glycemie (6). Comme pour beaucoup de choses, le moderation vient a l’esprit. Trop de pasteque peut provoquer des problemes intestinaux, comme pour tous les fruits et legumes d’ailleurs. Il est possible aussi que l'urine de votre chien soit un peu plus teinté, n’ayez aucune crainte, c’est juste du a son contenu en βcarotene. Alors venons-en au fait, pour améliorer l’ordinaire de votre chien grâce à la pastèque fraiche, voici quelques recettes qui vous permettront de faire aussi un excellent usage de toutes les parties de la pastèque, y compris la peau et des graines. Si votre pastèque est bio, vous pouvez tout utiliser. Si cela n’est pas le cas, à l’aide d’un épluche pomme-de-terres, ôter la partie verte du fruit, et ne conservez que la pulpe blanche. Attention : alors que la pulpe de la pastèque et relativement digeste, et peut être donnée à votre chien en cubes, la peau en revanche doit être réduite en purée. SMOOTHIE A LA PASTEQUE 500g de pastèque coupée en cubes (chair et/ou ecorce) 500ml de kéfir de lait, lait de noix de coco ou eau de coco (non sucrés bien sur) Mettez les ingrédients dans votre bol mixeur ou à smoothie et réduisez en purée. Vous pouvez le verser sur les croquettes de votre chien, ou lui donner comme ca. CREME GLACEE A LA PASTEQUE 350g de pastèque coupée en cubes 350ml de kéfir F2 Mettez vos cubes de pastèque au congélateur quelques heures, puis passez les a la moulinette. Y ajouter votre kéfir, bien mélanger puis passer à la sorbetière. Si vous n’avez pas de sorbetière, les fruits étant congelés, une fois réduits en purée, vous pouvez vous en passer. Verser dans des moules a esquimaux. SORBET A LA PASTEQUE 1 litre de pastèque réduite en purée ¼ de litre de jus de fruit bio sans sucre ajouté, ou eau de coco Pelez et coupez la pastèque en gros dés, et ôtez les graines (ou pas). Mettre au congélateur plusieurs heures. Lorsque les morceaux de pastèque sont congelés, les passer à la moulinette pour les réduire en purée. Y ajouter doucement le jus de fruit et continuer de mouliner. Vous obtiendrez alors un mélange homogène que vous pourrez verser dans un récipient ou faire des esquimaux pour vos chiens avec ; même pas besoin de sorbetière. JUS DE PASTEQUE Couper la pastèque en morceaux et mettez toutes les partie, peau (sauf la partie verte si la pastèque n’est pas bio) et graines comprises, dans votre extracteur. Le jus de pastèque est particulièrement indiqué en cas d’infection urinaire, de calculs rénaux, et pour prévenir l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Pour les 4 recettes ci-dessus, vous pouvez verser votre melange dans de petits moules en silicones pour en faire des friandises gelées. THÉ AUX GRAINES DE PASTEQUE 20 à 30 graines de pastèque Réduire les graines en poudre dans un moulin à épices, faire bouillir 15mn. Filtrer et laisser refroidir. Aussi indiqué pour le traitement des infections urinaires, calculs rénaux et l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Faire boire ce thé au chien pendant 2 jours, faire une pause le 3eme jour, et recommencer, toujours 2 jours sur 3. C’est un puissant diurétique et c’est aussi un laxatif, ne pas abuser. De nombreux sites font référence a une étude de 2014 sur le sujet, mais je ne suis pas parvenue à la trouver. PASTEQUE DESHYDRATEE Si votre pastèque n’est pas bio, pelez la partie verte. Coupez la pastèque en tranche de 1cm d’épaisseur. Oter la peau que vous réserverez pour un autre usage et coupez la chair de la pastèque en morceaux et essayer de récupérer les graines. Etalez les morceaux sur une grille au-dessus d’un récipient pour récupérer le jus, et laissez égoutter une petite heure. Epongez les avec un torchon propre ou du papier absorbant, et mettre dans le déshydrateur. Pour des morceaux de cette épaisseur, cela prend environ 8 à 10 heures à 55 degrés. Il est conseillé de retourner les morceaux de pastèque au bout de 6 heures pour que ça déshydrate bien des 2 cotés, et de ne pas trop les serrer car beaucoup d’humidité va s’en échapper. Vous aurez ainsi d’excellentes friandises qu’il ne faudra pas entasser les unes sur les autres car elles vont se coller. Séparez les a l’aide de papier sulfurisé, et n’en donnez pas trop à votre chien, c’est une confiserie. Mesdames et messieurs, a vos tabliers!

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable La spiruline est une micro-algue ou cyanobactérie bleu-vert en forme de spirale, d’où son nom, largement utilisée comme complément nutritionnel nutraceutique dans le monde entier. Elle pousse naturellement dans les réservoirs d'eau alcaline à haute teneur en sel dans les régions subtropicales et tropicales, y compris l'Amérique, le Mexique, l'Asie et l'Afrique centrale. Elle est aussi produite artificiellement dans des bacs ou bassins. Il y a plus de 400 ans elle était cultivée dans le lac Texcoco ou elle était récoltée, séchée et utilisée par les Mayas notamment, pour en faire une sorte de gâteau. Elle est riche en protéines, en vitamines et en minéraux, en acides gras essentiels comme l'EPA et le DHA (oméga-3) et en oméga-6, et en antioxydants.Pour être plus précis, et en moyenne selon la source de production : Pour 100g : Protéines 57g Glucides 24mg Fibres 3,57mg Vitamine A 570IU Vitamine B1 Thiamine 2,4mg Vitamine B2 Riboflavine 3,7mg Vitamine B3 Niacine 12,8mg Vitamine B4 Choline 66mg Vitamine B5 Acide Pantothénique 3,5mg Vitamine B6 0,4mg Vitamine C 10,1mg Vitamine K 25mcg Vitamine E (Alpha Tocophérol) 5mg Calcium 120mg Fer 28,5mg Magnésium 195mg Phosphore 118mg Potassium 1363mg Zinc 2mg Cuivre 6,1mg Manganese 1,9mg Selenium 7,2mcg Omega-3 823mg Omega-6 1254mgSuperoxyde-dismutase Alanine 4,7 g Arginine 4,3 g Acide aspartique 6,1 g Cystine 0,6 g Acide glutamique 9,1 g Glycine 3,2 g Histidine 1 g Isoleucine 3,5 g Leucine 5,4 g Lysine 2,9 Méthionine 1,4 g Phénylalanine 2,8 g Proline 2,7 g Sérine 3,2 g Thréonine 3,2 g Tryptophane 0,9 g Tyrosine 3 g Valine 4 g Je n’ai volontairement pas fait mention du contenu en vitamine B12, parce que la spiruline contient principalement de l’adéninylcobamide, dite pseudo vitamine B12, une forme de vitamine B12 inactive. En revanche elle contient aussi de la méthyl cobalamine en quantité relativement importante, et qui est une forme active de vitamine B12. Cependant, les informations à ce sujet sont très contradictoires. D’un côté on nous dit que la forme active de la vitamine B12 compense pour sa forme inactive, mais de l’autre on prétend que la forme inactive empêcherait l’absorption de la forme active... Il y a de quoi y perdre son latin. Et le contenu en iode alors, on n'en parle pas? La spiruline ne contient en principe pas d'iode, mais certaines marques en rajoutent, il faut donc bien lire les etiquettes. LES BIENFAITS DE LA SPIRULINE... DE LA TETE… AUX PATTES... ALOUETTE ! ET LE VENTRE... La spiruline est aussi ce qu’on appelle un prébiotique avec de puissants effets antimicrobiens qui aident à créer un équilibre dans la flore intestinale, en contrôlant le nombre de bactéries et de levures pathogènes, comme E. coli et Candida albicans, dans l’appareil digestif. Ceci est essentiel pour une digestion optimale et une absorption nutritionnelle. Les prébiotiques sont des polysaccharides qui ont la capacité de survivre dans l'estomac, contrairement aux bactéries probiotiques. Ils arrivent intactes dans le tractus gastro-intestinal inferieur ou les bactéries fermentent ces molécules robustes et les transforment en acides gras, si prisé par les cellules épithéliales, en substrat métabolique. ET LES YEUX Spiruline est chargée de zéaxanthine et de lutéine. Ces antioxydants sont extrêmement importants pour la santé des yeux, elle peut donc s’avérer utile dans la prévention et le traitement des cataractes, des glaucomes et l’atrophie rétinienne progressive, la rétinite d’origine diabétique, les dommages rétiniens néphrétiques et le durcissement des vaisseaux sanguins rétiniens (angiosclérose). ET LE POIL, ET LA PEAU La spiruline peut exercer ses pouvoirs sur le pelage et la peau de votre animal de compagnie. Depuis quelques mois j'ai non seulement augmenté la fréquence, mais aussi le dosage et les résultats sont impressionnants. Mon \"gros\" qui mue tellement a chaque changement climatique, au point de remplir un sac d'aspirateur tous les 10 jours, n'en a perdu que le 1/4 ce printemps, et son pelage est d'une douceur Cajoline! Ma femelle a de petits problemes de peau des que l'hiver s'en va (et c'est tot ou nous vivons), a un pelage d'une brillance exraordinaire, et pour le moment aucune demangeaisons soit 2 mois de gagnés sur la normale. Elle et mon 3eme chien (Malibu le Podenco) sont de veritables aimants a tiques, et la encore ils en attrappe 10 fois moins depuis les cures intensives de spiruline. Au lieu de leur donner la dose normale pendant 3 semaines, j'en donne en continu mais a bien plus grosses doses (voir dans le paragraphe dosage) et 2 ou 3 fois la semaine. Mais cela ne s’arrête pas là ! En effet, en 2013 une étude a été conduite sur les effets de la spiruline sur la démodécie canine. Dans le groupe de chiens traités avec une supplémentation journalière de spiruline (et un bain hebdomadaire chimique), 100% des sujets ont montré une rémission des signes cliniques sous environ 52 jours, et une guérison complète sous 70 jours, sans aucune rechute dans les 12 mois. Dans l’autre groupe de chiens qui n’étaient soumis qu’au bain chimique, seuls 3 chiens ont complètement guéris en 80-85 jours, et 80% ont montré une réduction des signes cliniques en environ 64 jours. Pour faire simple, les chiens n’ayant pas reçu de supplémentation en spiruline ont pris plus longtemps à guérir et ont eu un pourcentage de succès moindre (4). ET LE SYSTEME IMMUNITAIRE Des études in-vitro et sur des animaux indiquent que la spiruline peut stimuler le système immunitaire, protéger contre les réactions allergiques en inhibant la libération d'histamines – les substances qui contribuent aux symptômes d'allergie - et possède aussi des propriétés anticancéreuses. ET LE SANG La spiruline est un purificateur de sang puissant, en raison de sa richesse en chlorophylle qui améliore la capacité du corps à générer de nouvelles cellules comme des globules rouges ; elle fournit aussi une forme facilement absorbable de magnésium. Cette combinaison aide à oxygéner la circulation sanguine et a détoxifier le sang. Son contenu en phycocyanine et en allophycocyanine contribue aussi à augmenter le nombre de globules blancs. Des études ont aussi démontré qu’elle augmentait la production d'anticorps contre l'infection et les virus (notamment la grippe et HIV). ET LES DENTS… Tout comme l’algue ascophyllum nodosum, la spiruline peut aussi avoir un impact sur la lutte contre le tartre et la gingivite (5). Son contenu en calcium et en phosphore peut contribuer à reminéraliser les dents, mais sa richesse en vitamine C et K et ses vertus antibactériennes peuvent aussi aider à combattre le tartre dentaire. De là à dire que cela va miraculeusement faire disparaitre le tarte de votre chien ou chat, non, mais en association avec d’autres mesures, absolument ! D’ailleurs mes chiens ont régulièrement du kéfir de lait qui a eu un impact pour le moins évident sur le tartre dentaire de l’un d’entre eux, et depuis l’ajout de spiruline à leur alimentation, en cures, les résultats sont bluffants ! ETC… Enfin, elle contient des acides nucléiques (ADN et ARN) qui fournissent une méga dose de matières premières contribuant à la synthèse de la réparation de l'ADN, un extraordinaire éventail de phytonutriments antioxydants comme les anthocyanes et les caroténoïdes qui sont réputées pour leurs puissantes propriétés anti-cancérogènes. GUIDE D’ACHAT Il est important d'acheter une marque de spiruline réfutable, car elle peut être contaminée par des substances toxiques ou absorber les métaux lourds (plomb, mercure, cadmium et arsenic) de l'eau dans laquelle elle est cultivée. A ce sujet, certains sites affirment qu’on ne trouve des micro cystines que dans les algues bleu-vert et que cette toxine bactérienne n’est pas présente dans la spiruline, c’est entièrement faux. En 2008, 36 échantillons de spiruline venant de différents distributeurs en Chine ont été testés : 34 d’entre eux, soit 90%, contenaient des micro cystines. Même si certains de ces échantillons n’en contenaient que de faibles quantités, les risques liés une exposition chronique aux micro cystines doivent être pris au sérieux (1). Il existe plusieurs espèces de spiruline dont la Spirulina maxima (cultivée au Mexique, en Amérique Centrale), Spirulina pacifica (cultivée en Californie et Hawaï) et Spirulina platensis (Asie, Amérique du Sud, Kenya, Tchad) fusiformis qui sont les plus populaires. Ce petit detail devrait vous aider a determiner la provenance de votre spiruline si celle-ci n'est pas precisee sur l'etiquette. Les principaux producteurs de spiruline sont en Chine, au Japon, en Californie), à Hawaii, en Thaïlande, au Myanmar, en Australie, au Mexique, mais la France fait aussi partie des pays producteurs (spiruliniersdefrance.fr). La spiruline peut être récoltée de 2 façons : là où elle pousse naturellement, sur les eaux d’un lac comme le lac du Tchad, lac Texcoco, ou encore en Camargue, ou artificiellement dans des bassins, à l’abri des contaminations... Et c’est là qu’intervient le dilemme de la spiruline 100% bio ou pas. Pour se développer la spiruline a besoin de certains minéraux, mais surtout d’azote. Or jusqu’à récemment, ce dernier composant ne pouvait lui être apporté que sous forme d’engrais de synthèse. Depuis peu il existe une forme naturelle d’azote, à base de végétaux fermentés, mais qui dit fermentation dit bactéries. Nous entrons ici dans un domaine bien compliqué, mais il n’existe pas 30 moyens de se débarrasser des bactéries, et ceux-ci sont rarement naturels, surtout lorsqu’il s’agit de profitabilité. On doit donc faire face au dilemme bio et contenant potentiellement des bactéries, ou pas bio et contenant des résidus chimiques. Beaucoup de marques portent le logo Ecocert, or, il y aurait une différence énorme entre « contrôlé Ecocert » et « garanti Ecocert ». Personnellement j’ai du mal à comprendre la différence. Quand je le saurai, je réviserai cet article (je n’ai aucun problème à admettre mes failles). La qualité de la spiruline est impactée non seulement par sa méthode de production, mais aussi par la qualité de l'eau utilisée pour sa production étant donné que c'est un chélateur de métaux lourds. On rencontre ce probleme principalement dans la spiruline venant de zones ou on pratique l'agriculture intensive, et ou les nappes fréatiques et les sources d'eau sont contaminées par les rejets de pesticides et autres polluants, c'est notamment le cas du plus gros producteur mondial, la Chine, mais malheureusement aussi de la France ou quasiment tous les cours d'eau sont polués. Autre détail : si elle est cultivée sous serre, certains disent que tous les rayons du soleil ne passent pas, et qu'elle n'est donc pas de bonne qualité, mais les opposants a cet argument clament que si a l'air libre, elle récolte toutes les molecules qui sont dans l'air et ne peut donc pas etre pure. PAILLETTES, POUDRE OU COMPRIMÉS ? On trouve la spiruline sous plusieurs formes, les plus courantes étant les paillettes, la poudre et les comprimés. A partir du moment où il y a transformation, la qualité s’en ressent et cela peut aussi inclure certains additifs pas toujours naturels. Rapport qualité prix, on ne fait pas mieux que la version en paillettes ou en poudre. Viennent ensuite les comprimés, mais attention de bien lire l’étiquette au dos du flacon. Ils sont en général compressés à la machine, et ce processus peut être a froid ou pas, ce qui est rarement indiqué sur l’emballage. Ces comprimés contiennent souvent des additifs de compression, comme du stéarate que je vous conseille d'éviter, ou de la cellulose. Cette derniere n'est pas dramatique mais vous devez en tenir compte si vous avez un animal diabétique, par exemple. Difficile de s'y retrouver, n'est-ce pas? On trouve aussi la spiruline sous d’autres formes, mais intervient alors une autre forme de transformations et des additifs. Outre le fait que cela augmente fortement le prix, je ne suis pas certaine que la qualité soit au rendez-vous. J’ai une petite préférence pour les comprimés, plus facile a doser pour des gros chiens, moins salissants (avec la poudre ça en fichait partout et ça tache !). Il y a environ 2g de spiruline dans une cuiller à café. SPIRULINE BLEUE… Parce que la spiruline est aussi appelée l’algue bleue, certains vendeurs sans scrupules vendent de la « poudre de spiruline bleue, a prix d’or bien entendu. Notez bien la différence entre « spiruline » et « poudre de spiruline ». La soi-disant spiruline bleue est en fait de la phycocyanine, un complexe pigment-protéine de la famille des phycobiliprotéines (PBP) et qui est un pigment accessoire à la chlorophylle. C’est certes un antioxydant puissant, on lui confere de nombreuses vertus medicinales et il fait l’objet d’études. Mais posez-vous la question : comment exrait-on la phycocyanine de la spiruline ? Il existe plusieurs méthodes, mécaniques ou chimique, dont notamment l’utilisation d’acide hydrochlocrique, d’acide acétique, de phosphate trisodique (produit très irritant qui requiert l’utilisation de lunettes et de gants lors de sa manipulation), de propylene glycol, ou encore par homogénéisation, congélation, et sonication. Naturel ? Pas vraiment. Et si on commence a parler empreinte écologique, on est dans de sales draps. INTERACTIONS EFFETS SECONDAIRES Il est possible que la spiruline puisse interférer avec les médicaments administrés pour supprimer le système immunitaire (les corticoïdes), y compris : Adalimumab Azathioprine Cyclosporine Etanercept Infliximab Leflunomide Méthotrexate Mycophénolate Il est aussi conseillé de ne pas donner trop de spiruline aux chiens comme les Dalmatiens a cause du fort contenu de la spiruline en purine, et de leur tendance a faire des calcules d'urate, ou aussi les chiens prenant de l'Allopurinol ou tout autre produit du meme type pour la leishmaniose. Surdosage ? Non pas vraiment il en faudrait 20 fois la dose journalière sur une certaine période pour poser un problème, et si votre chien ou chat mange le contenu de la boite, au pire il aura une belle diarrhée. DOSAGE 50mg par tranche de 1kg de poids corporel, par jour, en cures de 10 a 21 jours max, en fonction du but recherché. Si vous la donnez en poudre, 1 CaC = 2g (soit la dose pour un animal de 40kg) Une autre facon d'en donner a vos chiens ou chats, c'est de suivre le principe de zoopharmacognosie (auto-medication animale), et le laisser en consommer autant qu'il veut. Pour cela, je dilue un peu de spiruline dans de l'eau (attention ca colle partout a la cuiller) et je le leur offre. Ma femelle en consomme une assez grande quantité, style 10 a 12g par session (2 ou 3 fois la semaine), soit 6 a 7 fois la dose pour son poids. Son pelage n'a jamais été aussi doux et brillant et elle semble attirer beaucoup moins les tiques. QUELQUES RECETTES GOURMANDES 1. Carrés croquants à la spiruline et aux amandes : 30g de noix de coco bio râpée crue 2 cuillers à soupe de spiruline en poudre 1 cuiller a soupe d'huile de coco bio pressée à froid 2 cuillers à soupe de d’amandes crues bio en poudre Les amandes crues étant en général vendues entières, réduisez-les en poudre, ou dans un moulin a épices (j’utilise un vieux moulin à café électrique), ou au mortier. Mélangez tous les ingrédients, et si la pâte est trop épaisse et a du mal à former une boule, vous pouvez rajouter un peu d’eau. Etalez votre pâte sur du papier sulfurisé sur environ 5 bons millimètres d’épaisseur. Avec un objet pas trop coupant, formez des carrés de 2cm de côté, et mettez au déshydrateur a la température la plus basse possible. Laissez déshydrater jusqu’à ce que vos biscuits soient bien croquants (une bonne dizaine d'heures, voir 12), les chiens adorent quand ça croustille ! 2. Chips banane spiruline 1 cuillère à soupe de spiruline 3 bananes 30g de graines de sésame biologiques crues, de graines de lin, ou de graines de citrouilles bio grossièrement concassées. 60g de copeaux de noix de coco bio 2 cuillères à soupe d'huile de noix de coco (fondue) Ecrasez les bananes à la fourchette et mélangez et la spiruline, ou mettez le tout dans un mixeur. Ajoutez les graines de sésame et l’huile de noix de coco fondue, puis les copeaux de noix de coco. Etalez sur du papier sulfurisé ou sur une feuille pour déshydrateur, sur un bon 5mm d’épaisseur, et faites des petites chips carrées d’environ 2cm ; faites déshydrater à basse température 10 à 12 heures, ou jusqu’à ce que vos chips soient croquants. 3. Bonbons gélifiés a la spiruline 250ml de bouillon d'os maison selon notre recette (Le Fameux Bouillon d'Os de VMN 50g de spiruline en poudre ou en paillettes 3 ou 4 feuilles de gélatine) Faites tremper les feuilles de gélatine dans un bol d'eau froide pendant 15 a 20mn. Faites chauffer votre bouillon d'os sans qu'il soit bouillon (environ 70 degrés) puis jetez y les feuilles de gélatine préalablement égouttées et essorées avec vos doigts. Mélangez jusqu\\a ce que la gélatine soit entierement dissoute. Laisser refroidir a environ 40 degrés, puis ajoutez la spiruline. Bien mélanger et verser dans de petits moules en silicone. Vous pouvez ne pas utiliser de gélatine si vous faites réduire votre bouillon de moitié, mais vous aurez besoin de la meme quantité finale que dans la recette. Une autre alternative est de faire ces memes bonbons avec de l'huile de noix de coco. En été vous pouvez les donner congelés.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Doug English, un vétérinaire au Marlin Coast Vet Hospital (North Queensland, Australie), utilise le curcuma depuis plusieurs décennies. Il a pu observer des résultats très positifs sur les dermatites allergiques, l'atopie, le Queensland Itch chez les chevaux, l'arthrite chez les chiens et les chevaux, les irritations intestinales, une capacité athlétique accrue et une amélioration générale de la santé. D’après plus de 7000 recherches, il a été démontré que le curcuma dépassait de très loin les produits pharmaceutiques dans ses effets contre plusieurs maladies chroniques et débilitantes, sans effets secondaires indésirables. C’est est une épice très riche en antioxydants, connue pour soulager les symptômes et offrir une protection pour toute une série de conditions. Divers essais cliniques ont montré des effets prometteurs dans le traitement de certains cancers, de maladies cardiovasculaires, de problèmes digestifs comme la maladie de Crohn, le côlon irritable, l'ulcère gastrique, l'inflammation gastrique, la colite ulcéreuse, etc. mais aussi le diabète, certaines formes de pancréatites, l’uvéite, le SIDA, certaines affections rénales, l’arthrose, la prostatite bactérienne chronique, etc. Le curcuma a aussi démontré une protection contre certaines conditions hépatiques. Il contribue à la perte de poids en bloquant la propagation de la graisse dans les tissus, en inhibant la croissance de nouveaux vaisseaux sanguins, appelée angiogenèse, qui est nécessaire pour construire le tissu adipeux. De plus, les taux de glucose, acides gras, cholestérol et stéatose hépatique sont aussi réduits. Il peut dont favoriser la perte de poids. Le curcuma favorise la croissance des cellules saines et renforce le corps au niveau cellulaire. En d'autres termes, il a la capacité de promouvoir la division cellulaire saine, et le potentiel d’aider à bloquer les radicaux libres qui favorisent la croissance cellulaire anormale (les cancers, les lymphomes). Associé aux oméga-3, il peut contribuer à la réparation des cellules du cerveau de de la moelle épinière (2), et de récentes études pointent aussi vers l'activité anti-épileptogénique de la curcumine, un anti-oxydant présent dans le curcuma (12). C’est un antiseptique, un analgésique et un anti-inflammatoire, on peut donc aussi l’utiliser comme désinfectant sur plaies et brûlures, et il possède aussi des vertus antiparasites (4) et a dans une étude, a prouvé réduire la plaque dentaire d'environ 62%, sur une période de 21 jours. Explorons donc certaines de ces vertus en détail et comment elles s’appliquent à nos animaux de compagnie. 1. UTILISATION DU CURCUMA POUR TRAITER DIFFÉRENTS TYPES DE BLESSURES, ABCÈS, BRÛLURES Le curcuma augmente les taux de synthèse du collagène, améliore la contraction des plaies, augmente la résistance tissulaire et la prolifération des cellules autour des plaies. En cas de brûlures ou blessures, vous pouvez aussi utiliser le curcuma pour prévenir ou traiter l’infection et soulager la douleur. On peut mettre de la poudre de curcuma directement sur la plaie pour arrêter les saignements, et faire un cataplasme pour toutes sortes de lésions, coupures, blessures, etc. Le curcuma peut aussi contribuer à réduire la concentration de bactéries telles que Enterococcus Faecalis et E. Coli sur les lésions et inhiber la prolifération de Staphylococcus, études à l’appui. A - BRULURES AU 1ER ET SECOND DEGRÉ : Mélanger 1 cuiller à café de gel d’aloe vera et 1 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma. Appliquer sur la brûlure et couvrir d’une gaze stérile/bandage. Renouveler 2 à 3 fois par jour selon la gravité. B - COUPURES, ABRASIONS, HOTSPOTS, FURONCLES, ABCÈS : Après avoir rasé la zone autour de la lésion, nettoyer avec de l’argent colloïdal (voir détails en cliquant ICI), puis utilisez l’une des options suivantes à base d’huile de lin qui renforce l’action analgésique et antibactérienne du curcuma: Option 1 – Cataplasme Au Curcuma : Mélanger 1 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma bio, avec environ la même quantité d’huile de lin, et appliquer sur la blessure 3 fois par jour le temps nécessaire. Option 2 - Macérât Huileux Au Curcuma (usage externe) : Faire chauffer 230ml d’huile de lin dans une casserole, Couper un petit oignon en fines tranches et les faire frire dans cette huile, jusqu’à ce qu’elles soient bien brunes (mais pas brûlées) et croquantes. Oter les oignons et ajouter 2 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma. Retirer du feu et laisser refroidir à température ambiante. Appliquer sur les lésions à l’aide d’un coton ou d’une gaze stérile 3 fois par jour jusqu’à guérison complète. Conserver ce mélange au frais dans un récipient hermétique. Eviter de laisser l'animal lécher le macérat. 2. UTILISATION DU CURCUMA POUR LES PROBLEMES CUTANES Les vertus antioxydantes et anti-inflammatoires du curcuma se révelent aussi fort utiles dans de nombreux problemes de peau. Il peut ainsi aider a traiter le psoriasis par voie interne (4). Le curcuma peut aussi se révéler utile dans le traitement des pododermatites ou l'on retrouve souvent des souches de bactéries résistantes aux traitements, comme Staph. aureus. La curcumine contenue dans le curcuma inverse la résistance aux médicaments dans cette souche et aide ainsi a la combattre, par voie externe sous forme d'huile de curcuma, par exemple, et par voie interne pour renforcer son action antiseptique. Grace a son contenu en Ar-tumerone, il peut aussi etre utilisé pour traiter différentes formes de teigne comme microsporum canis, et autres types de dermatophytoses (5). De récentes études montrent aussi son activité contre la leishmaniose cutanée, grace encore une fois a la turmérone, une raison de plus d'en donner a votre chien si vous vivez dans l'une des zones endémiques (6). Le curcuma peut aussi intéragir avec d'autres complements pour combattre les réactions immuno-allergiques en réduisant la production de cellules inflammatoires et l'activité des cox et des lox et la migration des cellules immunitaires, et en modulant l'activité des protéines NF-κB. En plus de réduire les médiateurs inflammatoires des prostaglandines, il réduit également les autres médiateurs majeurs des cytokines, un peu comme Apoquel, mais sans les inconvénients (9). Il a aussi un très bon effet anti-inflammatoire sur la peau et peur promouvoir la croissance d'une peau en bonne santé et d’un pelage épais et sain. Enfin, le curcuma possede aussi des vertus acaricides et peut etre utilise en interne comme en externe pour combattre notamment les mites demodex et les sarcoptes. Pour cette utilisation vous avez 2 suggestions de recette : Mélangez une CaS de poudre de curcuma bio avec quelques gouttes de jus de citron pour former une pate, et appliquez sur les lésions. Laissez agir une heure, puis rincez a l'eau tiede, ou... Melangez 1 CaC de poudre de curcuma bio et de poudre de neem auxquelles vous ajouterez suffisamment d'eau pour former une pate. Appliquez sur les lésions et laissez sécher. Rinsez a l'eau tiede. ATTENTION AU PELAGE BLANC : ca tache! 3 - UN ANTI-INFLAMMATOIRE POUR COMBATTRE L’ARTHROSE, L’ARTHRITE, LES ENTORSES, LES FRACTURES, LES HERNIES DISCALES, ETC. L’une des conditions pour lesquelles le curcuma a prouvé être bénéfique est l'arthrose. Le curcuma contient plus de deux douzaines de composants anti-inflammatoires, y compris les inhibiteurs COX-2 sélectifs. L'enzyme COX-2 provoquant la douleur et l'inflammation, ces inhibiteurs bloquent sélectivement cette enzyme. Pour maximiser son potentiel, il est préférable d’ajouter au curcuma du poivre noir et un type de graisse,. Le problème avec la curcumine c’est son faible niveau de biodisponibilité. La plupart de la curcumine ingérée est métabolisée avant d’avoir pu être absorbée par l’organisme. La pipérine augmente donc cette biodisponibilité. C’est peut-être parce que la pipérine inhibe certaines enzymes digestives intestinales. Des études ont été menées sur des humains et des animaux et qui ont révélé que même lorsque 2g de curcumine sont ingérés, ses taux sériques étaient très faibles. Toutefois, lorsque 20mg pipérine ont été rajoutés, la biodisponibilité de la curcumine avait augmenté de 2000%, soit 20 fois (3). L’ajout de graisse à la curcumine lui permet d’être directement absorbée par la circulation sanguine, par l’intermédiaire du système lymphatique, une partie contournant ainsi le foie. Pour le curcuma, comme la pipérine, il est très important de sélectionner des ingrédients de qualité. Les petits flacons saupoudreurs vendus en supermarchés sont la pire qualité que vous puissiez trouver. Outre le fait que leur efficacité est limitée, la curcumine en a souvent été extraite à l’aide de solvants, pour la confection des gélules de curcuma. Choisissez du curcuma bio, et de même pour le poivre noir. J’achète du poivre sauvage de Madagascar que je mouds moi-même, d’excellente qualité, qui ne pique pas et très agréable au goût. Une autre façon de stimuler l'absorption de la curcumine est de la consommer dans les aliments entiers, comme dans la racine de curcuma fraiche, parce que les huiles naturelles présentes dans la racine de curcuma peuvent améliorer la biodisponibilité de la curcumine de 7 à 8 fois (mais quand même, contre 20 fois en poudre avec l’ajout de poivre). La recette de la pâte de curcuma au bas de cette page contient tous les ingrédients nécessaires. Pour fournir à votre animal de compagnie une autre forme de soulagement, en cas de fracture, entorse, hernies discales, etc. vous pouvez aussi tremper un morceau de gaze ou un linge propre dans un macérât huileux de curcuma, l'appliquer sur la zone douloureuse, et le sécuriser avec un bandage pour la nuit : Faire chauffer 230ml d’huile de lin dans une casserole, couper un petit oignon en fines tranches et les faire frire dans cette huile, jusqu’à ce qu’elles soient bien brunes (mais pas brûlées) et croquantes. Oter les oignons et ajouter 2 cuiller à café de poudre de curcuma. Retirer du feu et laisser refroidir à température ambiante. Conserver ce mélange dans un récipient hermétique. Si vous n’avez pas tous ces ingrédients sous la main, vous pouvez tout simplement faire une pate épaisse avec de la poudre de curcuma et de l’eau, placer une gaze stérile sur la zone à traiter, et y appliquer cette pâte. Couvrez avec un bandage. L’Ideal est de pouvoir le laisser toute la nuit. 4 - TUMEURS BENIGNES ET CANCERS DE LA PEAU J’essaierai de revenir sur ce paragraphe plus en détail, mais je voulais d’ores et déjà partager une recette intérasssante pour traiter les cancers de la peau : A - Baume au curcuma : 1 cuiller à café d’huile de noix de coco ¼ de cuiller à café de curcuma en poudre ¼ de cuiller à café de bicarbonate de soude Quelques gouttes d’huile de ricin Mélanger ces ingrédients pour former une pâte, l’appliquer sur une gaze stérile et poser en cataplasme sur la tumeur. Maintenir avec un bandage et laisser agir toute la nuit pour les grosses tumeurs. Pour les petites tumeurs simplement appliquer ce mélange sur la lésions 3 à 5 fois par jour. Photos Avant/Après en cliquant ICI B- Baume au curcuma de Karen Becker Pour les tumeurs dites solides (ou la peau est intacte). Attention ne jamais utiliser cette formule si la peau n’est pas intacte car ça serait très douloureux pour l’animal. 2 Cas de Curcuma bio en poudre 1 CaS d’huile végétale bio (huile de coco par exemple) 1 CaS de jus de citron (anti-inflammatoire et antitumoral) 1 Ca S de sel Mélanger ces ingrédients et appliquer sur la tumeur aussi souvent que possible. C – Gel au curcuma de Karen Becker Pour les tumeurs ou la peau est endommagée, ouverte, ulcérée, etc. 1 CaS curcuma bio en poudre 1 CaS de miel de manuka 1 capsule broméline 1 Cas de gel d’aloé frais Mélanger ces ingrédients et appliquer sur la tumeur aussi souvent que possible. D- Recette du baume « SUPERHEAL SKIN & GROWTH CARE » de Augistine Approved Décidément les Australiens sont capables d’accomplir des miracles avec le curcuma ! Ce baume est assez spectaculaire a en croire les témoignages d’utilisateurs. Le baume Superheal peut être utilisé sur toutes formes d’excroissances et tumeurs de la peau, comme les verrues, les lipomes, les acrochordons, les mastocytomes, et même des tumeurs mammaires, etc. Les photos Avant/Après sont assez impressionnantes. 1/3 (en grammes) de curcuma en poudre bio 1/3 d’huile de noix de coco bio, vierge/extra vierge et pressée à froid 1/3 de lécithine de soja bio en poudre Mélangez le curcuma et la lécithine, puis ajoutez l’huile de coco pour former une pâte. Versez dans un bocal en verre. Se conserve au réfrigérateur plusieurs semaines. La pâte risque d’être un peu dure et difficile a étaler au sortir du réfrigérateur, il est conseillé de prélever la quantité dont vous avez besoin et de laisser 5mn a température ambiante avant de l’utiliser. Etalez la pate sur la lesion/tumeur/excroissance puis appliquez un bandage dessus. Laissez agir 24 heures, puis recommencez le processus pendant 7 jours Laissez a l’air sans rien pendant 24 heures Si la masse n’est pas tombée au bout de ce temps, renouvelez l’application 2 a 5 jours de plus ou jusqu’à ce qu’elle tombe. Le zone risque d’etre a vif a ce moment la, il conviendra donc de veiller a garder la zone propre. Pour les lésions de grande taille, la supervision de votre vétérinaire peur s'avérer nécessaire. Il n’y a pas d’alternative pour la lecithine de soja, son but étant de faciliter l’absorption de la pâte par l’épiderme. 5 - DIGESTION Le curcuma favorise la production de bile, améliorant ainsi les fonctions digestives des lipases qui digère les graisses, la chymotrypsine - une peptidase digestive de la famille des protéases - qui digère les protéines, et de l'amylase qui digère les hydrates de carbone. Il faut tout de même noter que dans l’étude qui démontrait ces faits, une combinaison de curcuma, piment rouge, poivre noir, cumin et d'oignon avait été utilisée, presque doublant la sécrétion de bile et augmentant l'activité de la lipase de 40 % et l'activité de la chymotrypsine de 77%. Cette même activité contribue à détoxifier le foie, aide à maintenir un système digestif sain et réduire les ballonnements. Le curcuma est aussi utile pour combattre les problèmes de santé causés par la bactérie Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), tels que la gastrite, l'ulcère gastroduodénal, et le cancer gastrique. Selon une autre étude de 2009, la curcumine a prouvé stopper efficacement la croissance de H. pylori in vitro, indépendamment de la constitution génétique des souches. Pour tous ces problèmes digestifs, utilisez la pâte de curcuma et la grille de dosage fournie avec la recette au bas de cette page, mais ne donnez jamais seul. Vous pouvez le mélanger à de la nourriture humide, du yaourt nature, ou mieux du kéfir de lait ! 6. APPAREIL URINAIRE D’après certains herboristes en Inde, une vessie hyperactive peut etre due a une inflammation, sans pour autant qu’il y ait infection. Une substance appelée NF kappa-B est l'un des principaux déclencheurs de l'inflammation de la vessie et le curcuma empêche le corps de le fabriquer. En tant que puissant antioxydant, le curcuma peut donc aider à prévenir l'infection urinaire en premier lieu, mais aussi grâce à son composant connu sous le nom de curcumine. Suivez le dosage au bas de la recette de la pate de curcuma. En cas d’infection urinaire avérée vous pouvez aussi faire à votre animal une infusion de curcuma : Faites bouillir 250ml d’eau Ajoutez-y une cuillère à café de curcuma Laissez refroidir et servez a votre chien avec un peu de miel bio pour le goût et les bienfaits. Cette même recette peut être utilisée pour traiter les infections du sang. 7. AMELIORE LA FONCTION THYROIDIENNE Il semblerait en effet. Des études sont en cours sur ce sujet, mais certains résultats et exemples cliniques sembleraient le confirmer. Une étude menée au Pakistan sur un certain nombre de sujets souffrant d'un goitre (inflammation de la glande thyroïde en 2015 semble aussi pointer dans cette direction (7). Plus précisément et en ce qui concerne nos 4-pattes, l'histoire de Wunder (8), une rottweiler dont les niveaux de T4 étaient toujours au minimum et qu'elle devait faire controler régulierement. En 2013, avant la prise de curcuma, sa T4 était a 9 En 2014, quelques mois apres la prise de curcuma, sa T4 était a 15,9 En 2016 apres 3 ans de curcuma, sa T4 était a 28,4 COMMENT CHOSIR UN CURCUMA DE QUALITÉ ? La sempiternelle question ! Dans la recette ci-dessous, je déconseille le curcuma en pot, vendu sans le rayon épices de votre supermarché, parce que celui-ci se compose souvent des résidus de curcuma, après extraction de son composant actif, la curcumine ou extrait de curcuma que vous trouvez en gélules. Non seulement cette poudre ne contient pour ainsi dire plus de ce composant actif, mais l’extraction de l’extrait pouvant s’effectuer à l’aide solvants chimiques, elle peut contenir des résidus. Comme si cela ne suffisait pas, pour augmenter le volume du produit final certains fabricants peu scrupuleux rajoutent des choses peu ragoutantes qui n’ont rien à y faire (sciure de bois, craie, chromate de plomb, cadmium, jaune de métanile, etc. Pour exemple, en 2013 la Food and Drugs Administration américaine a trouvé des traces de plomb dans une marque de curcuma en provenance du Bengladesh, et de nouveau en aout 2016. N’allez pas croire que les gélules de curcuma sont indemnes de toute contamination car en 2009, une marque de suppléments en provenance du Mexique a révélé contenir du nimésulide, un puissant anti-inflammatoire qui cause d’importants dommages au foie, et banni dans de nombreux pays. Même lorsqu’on achète un produit certifié bio, il y a toujours un risque, car malheureusement, malgré la réglementation des produits producteurs personne n’est à l’abri d’un acte de corruption. C’est l’une des raisons pour lesquelles je préfère le curcuma destiné à la consommation humaine, qui font l’objet d’un contrôle plus rigoureux. SOUS QUELLE FORME ADMINISTRER LE CURCUMA À VOTRE ANIMAL DE COMPAGNIE PAR VOIE INTERNE? 1. SOUS FORME DE SAUCE (IDEALE SUR LES CROQUETTES) Mettez la quantité de poudre de curcuma désirée dans une tasse (prenons 1 cuiller à café comme exemple), donner un tour de moulin à poivre, une cuiller à café d’huile d’olive ou de noix de coco, puis remplissez la tasse aux 1/3 d’eau chaude, et laissez refroidir. Versez sur les croquettes. 2. SOUS FORME D’EPS (EXTRAIT DE PLANTE STANDARDISÉ) Les EPS sont des extraits fluides de plantes à usage pharmaceutique, issues de l’agriculture biologique, sans sucre ni alcool. Ils contiennent une très forte concentration et ne doivent pas être utilisés sur une longue durée. Le dosage est de 1ml par 5kg de poids corporel, le total ne devant pas excéder 5ml pour un gros chien. Cela veut dire que si votre chien pèse 50kg, la dose sera la même que pour un chien de 25kg. Sous cette forme, il est conseillé de faire l'objet d'un suivi d'un vétérinaire naturopathe, et de donner qu'en cure, car c'est une forme assez concentrée. 3 -SOUS FORME DE PÂTE Recette au bas de cette page. L'avantage de cette formule c'est qu'on peut donner tous les jours, et a vie, il n'y a pas d'accoutumance, et cela n'est pas une dose assez forte pour poser probleme. LA POLEMIQUE SUR L’AJOUT DE POIVRE NOIR La question du poivre revient souvent pour les animaux sujets aux problèmes gastriques, et là encore les mythes ont la vie dure. Voici donc la réponse du Dr. English (vétérinaire) à ce sujet : « La plupart des problèmes digestifs sont le résultat d'un manque d'acide chlorhydrique plutôt qu’un excès. Le poivre noir stimule les papilles et avertit l'estomac d’augmenter la sécrétion d'acide chlorhydrique, améliorant la digestion. Sans des quantités suffisantes, la nourriture non digérée peut rester dans l'estomac pendant de longues périodes, entraînant des brûlures d'estomac et l'indigestion. Les aliments non digérés peuvent également passer dans les intestins, où nourrir les mauvaises bactéries, produisant des gaz, de l'irritation, la diarrhée ou la constipation. Le poivre noir peut agir comme diurétique, réduire les ballonnements dans le tractus intestinal où il favorise la santé digestive grâce à ses effets antioxydants. » Certes l’étude prouvant ce fait a été réalisée sur des humains et il est effectivement possible que l’action ne soit pas la même chez le chien, et il n’y a encore eu aucune étude de faite sur les chiens ou les chats spécifiquement. Sur cette question, Doug répond : « Je sais que nous n'avons pas de définition concernant l’effet spécifique sur l'absorption chez les chiens et c'est la raison même pour laquelle j'ai commencé la page TUG – pour y réunir des preuves anecdotiques. Avec 211 000 membres qui l'utilisent activement, il n'y a pas d'anecdotes sur la pipérine causant de vrais problèmes, et le poivre en lui-même est un très bon aliment et pas seulement un condiment pour la saveur. » Lors d’une interview sur ce sujet il a répondu : « La pipérine dans le poivre aide le curcuma à rester dans le sang plus longtemps sans être métabolisé et éliminé. » « …. La pipérine est un extrait (et généralement très concentré) de poivre noir entier (piper nigrum). Donc, ajouter du poivre noir fraîchement moulu à votre curcuma n'est pas la même chose que d'ingérer de la pipérine hautement concentrée… » (11) Le poivre noir contient aussi un cannabinoïde, le caryophyllène (ß-caryophyllène sesquiterpène) qui affecte seulement les récepteurs CB2 cannabinoïdes, soulageant ainsi la douleur, inhibant l’inflammation, et stimulant le système immunitaire. Par mesure de précautions, si votre chat ou chien présente une pathologie de colon irritable, MICI, etc. n’ajoutez pas de poivre. CONTRE INDICATIONS ET EFFETS SECONDAIRES Le curcuma n'est pas compatible avec certaines formes de chimio, vérifiez donc avec votre vétérinaire oncologue si votre animal suit ce protocole. Il est aussi à éviter en cas d'obstruction des canaux biliaires. Eviter aussi son utilisation en conjonction avec d'autres draineurs hépatiques pour ne pas mettre le foie a trop lourde contribution. Il n’est pas compatible avec les radiations, car il protège le corps contre leurs effets nocifs (il est question ici de radiothérapie, pas de radiologie, ça n'interfère donc pas avec une radio des os). Le curcuma peut réduire la résistance à l’insuline. Antidépresseur naturel, il peut donc augmenter les effets de certaines drogues comme le Prozac pour animaux. La pipérine dans la pâte de curcuma peut aussi interférer avec certains narcotiques, par conséquent à ne pas donner des animaux prenant un tel traitement. Ne pas donner de curcuma aux animaux sous traitement pour des pathologies comme l’épilepsie, ou autres maladies neurodégénératives sans avis médical. Le curcuma peut aussi interférer avec les antibiotiques à base de fluor quinolone. Il est suggéré de l'utiliser avec précautions, ou de ne pas en prendre en conjonction avec certains anticoagulants ou supplément ayant comme lui des vertus anticoagulantes, donc à vérifier avec votre vétérinaire naturopathe. J’insiste sur le naturopathe car beaucoup de vétérinaires conventionnels ont peu ou pas de connaissances dans ce domaine, et se contentent de dire que c’est un anticoagulant, en exagérant les effets. En cas de fracture, ou d'une intervention chirurgicale comme l'ostéotomie, consultez votre veterinaire. Le curcuma est une alternative naturelle aux analgésiques pour le traitement de l'inflammation. Cependant, l'inflammation est une partie essentielle du processus de guérison des fractures, et par conséquent, si un anti-inflammatoire n'est pas prescrit par votre vétérinaire, évitez donc le curcuma qui pourrait antagoniser la repousse des os. Dans une telle situation le dosage est important, d'ou la necessité de consulter votre vétérinaire naturopathe. À cause de son effet détoxifiant, le curcuma peut être la cause de selles molles ou de maux d’estomac. Réduisez la dose à 1/8ème de celle prévue pendant au moins une semaine, puis augmentez la dose très progressivement. RECETTE DE LA PATE DE CURCUMA Recette élaborée par Doug English Pour faire une bonne pâte de curcuma, il faut du curcuma en poudre, un corps gras, et du poivre noir. 1. La poudre de curcuma : Attention, le curcuma ça tache ! Il est aussi important de trouver du curcuma de bonne qualité car beaucoup de curcuma bon marché contient très peu de curcumine, elle a été ôtée pour fabriquer des gélules et les résidus vendus à bas prix. Un curcuma de bonne qualité contient entre 3 et 5% de curcumine, minimum. Vous pourrez en trouver du bon vendu en vrac dans les épiceries ethniques. Si vous n'êtes pas surs de la qualité, alors achetez du curcuma bio dans une boutique ou un site spécialisé. 2. Un corps gras : Le curcuma doit être dissout pour être digéré, or il n'est soluble que dans l'huile ou l'alcool, d'où la nécessité de lui ajouter de l'huile pour qu'il soit absorbé. Selon l'animal pour lequel la pâte est destinée, on préfèrera une huile végétale comme l'huile d'olive, de lin, de noix de coco, bio, vierge et pressée à froid, qui résistent le mieux l'oxydation. Je déconseille l'huile de lin, car elle se dégrade rapidement et cette oxydation peut avoir des conséquences négatives. L'huile de noix de coco se figeant en dessous de 24 degrés Celsius, c'est celle que je préfère et c’est aussi celle qui est la plus efficace d’après Doug English.S'il n'est pas dissout, le curcuma passera dans l'appareil digestif sans être absorbé, n'aura aucun bienfait et risque d'irriter le colon. 3. Le poivre noir : Le poivre noir contient de la pipérine, un alcaloïde qui joue 2 rôles dans la recette. Outre le fait qu'il multiplie la biodisponibilité du curcuma, il permet aussi au foie d'en extraire la curcumine (le composant actif) plus lentement, lui permettant de passer dans la circulation sanguine. Ce petit ajout à lui tout seul multiplie les effets du curcuma par 20. Il est préférable d'utiliser du poivre en grain et de le moudre grossièrement juste avant de l'ajouter à la pâte. Vous pouvez moudre le poivre à l'avance et le mettre aussitôt au congélateur pour l'utiliser avec votre prochaine \"fournée\" de pate de curcuma. N'utilisez pas de poivre pré-moulu, vendu en grande surface, c'est un sous-produit qui contient peu ou pas de pipérine, et n'a donc aucune valeur ; le poivre pré-moulu même bio ne contient plus de pipérine non plus. Achetez du poivre en grains, bio bien entendu. 4. La cannelle de Ceylan : L'ajout de cannelle est facultatif, mais outre le fait qu'il augmente l'effet anti-inflammatoire du curcuma, la cannelle aide aussi a réduire ou éliminer l'odeur de pipi de chat que certains chiens ont lorsqu'ils consomment du curcuma. Il est crucial d'utiliser de la vraie cannelle, celle de Ceylan \"Cinnamomum Verum\" aussi dite \"cinnamomum zeylanicum\", mais surtout pas celle du supermarché, la cannelle de Chine \"Cinnamomum Cassia\". La différence reside dans le fait que celle de Chine a une forte teneur en coumarine, alors que celle de Ceylan n'en contient quasiment pas. La coumarine est toxique, en général, et pour les chiens en particulier, car elle inhibe les enzymes responsables du recyclage de la vitamine K, ce qui compromet certains facteurs de coagulation. Ajoutée au curcuma qui a déja des vertus anti-coagulantes, ca n'est pas une bonne idée. D'ailleurs la coumarine entre dans la composition de certains raticides. INGREDIENTS 65g de curcuma en poudre bio, de bonne qualité (contient entre 3 et 5% de curcumine, la teneur la plus courante) ou 200g de racine de curcuma fraiche 1/2 à 3/4 de cuiller à café de poivre noir fraîchement moulu 125ml d'eau 70ml d'huile d'olive, de lin ou de noix de coco bio (on ne peut pas utiliser n’importe quel type d’huile, les effets ne sont pas les mêmes) 1/2 cuiller à café de de cannelle de Ceylan - OPTIONNEL. On se sait pas si c'est l'effet détoxifiant, mais certains animaux sentent parfois l'urine, lorsqu'ils commencent a prendre du curcuma, la cannelle aide à eliminer cette odeur. Je n'ai jamais eu le problème avec mes chiens. Assurez vous d'utiliser de la cannelle de Ceylan (Cinnamomum verum = Cinnamomum zeylanicum), pas celle de Chine (Cinnamomum cassia) vendue en supermarché qui n'a souvent de la cannelle que ne nom mais plus les vertus, car elle contient de hauts niveaux de coumarine, toxique pour le foie et peut aussi etre la cause d'allergies. PREPARATION Mélangez le curcuma avec l'eau dans une casserole et remuez. Ça va tout de suite épaissir. Mettez sur feu moyen et rajoutez un peu d’eau, juste assez pour légèrement liquéfier et continuez de mélanger. Des que votre mélange va chauffer, il va épaissir de nouveau, vous rajoutez donc encore un peu d’eau, et vous laissez de nouveau épaissir. Au total il faut chauffer le curcuma de 7 à 8mn minimum. Il doit avoir la consistance d’une purée épaisse, s’il est trop liquide, continuez de le chauffer un peu jusqu’à ce qu’il épaississe suffisamment. Ajoutez alors le poivre noir fraîchement moulu, puis l'huile. Mélangez et versez le tout dans un pot avec un couvercle, puis mettez au réfrigérateur. La pâte se garde ainsi 3 à 4 semaines, mais on recommande de l’utiliser sous 2 semaines, car passé ce délai, elle commence à perdre de son efficacité. On peut aussi la conserver au congélateur jusqu’à 4 mois. Si vous utilisez du curcuma frais, comme il a une moins forte concentration de curcumine, il faut en mettre très peu d’eau puisqu'il en contient déjà une forte teneur, et qu'il contient 3 fois moins de curcumine. Il faudra aussi le chauffer/cuire davantage pour libérer ses antioxydants. DOSAGE Le dosage dépend davantage du besoin de votre animal que de son poids. Par exemple, ma chienne de 28kg est à 1 cuiller à café par jour depuis un an et cela semble lui suffire,mais quand je vois qu'elle et un peu raide parce qu'elle a trop fait le bourrin, je lui en donne 3 ou 4 pendant quelques jours. Comme pour tout supplément, il faut commencer par une toute petite dose, non seulement pour habiter votre animal au goût (certains l’adorent d’autres ont besoin de s’y habituer progressivement), ainsi que vérifier si ça n’a pas d’effets indésirables sur leur appareil digestif ; c’est rare mais ça arrive. La colonne « jusqu’à » n’est ici qu’à titre indicatif, pour vous donner une idée de ce qu’on peut devoir donner en cas de symptômes prononcés, mais ne veut en aucun cas dire que vous devez donner autant, ou même vous arrêter là. Certains animaux peuvent avoir besoin de beaucoup plus, et d'autres d'un peu moins, vous pouvez élire de doubler ou tripler cette dose (progressivement bien entendu) si besoin est. L'idéal est de répartir cette quantité en 2 prises par jour pour un effet cumulatif.

Il vaut aussi mieux augmenter la dose progressivement pour ne pas choquer leur appareil digestif. L’idéal est de répartir la dose en 2 ou 3 fois par jour. Les résultats ne sont pas garantis a 100%, mais très souvent, le manque d’efficacité est dû ou à un curcuma de piètre qualité ou une dose insuffisante.

Cela n’est donc pas un hasard si les feuilles de cet arbre possèdent tant de bienfaits, tant pour nous que pour nos animaux domestiques. La feuille d’olivier est connue pour ses nombreuses vertus, grace notamment à son contenu en oleuropéine, et 400 fois plus d’antioxydants que la vitamine C. Bien que contenant un plus fort pourcentage en oleuropéine, la feuille d’olivier en poudre sous forme de gélules est moins bien absorbée par le corps que la teinture mère ou de thé, et peut aussi être la cause de problèmes gastriques. Ces gélules contiennent aussi très souvent des excipients comme le talc et le stéarate de magnésium, et cela n’est pas toujours précisé sur les étiquettes. Certaines gélules contiennent un mélange de feuilles en poudre et d’extrait de feuille en poudre ; cette forme est préférable et mieux absorbée. Les feuilles séchées peuvent contenir jusqu’à 9% d’oleuropéine, alors que l’extrait en poudre contient aux alentours de 20%. La forme la mieux absorbée est la teinture mère. Et l’alcool, direz-vous ? Ce ne sont pas quelques gouttes d’alcool dans un remède qui vont rendre votre animal de compagnie alcoolique ou l’enivrer, mais il existe d’autres alternatives pour ceux ne sont pas convaincus. Vous pouvez aussi dissoudre la quantité requise dans quelques gouttes d'eau chaude (pas bouillante), et laisser refroidir quelques minutes, cela aura pour effet d'évaporer l'alcool. SES BIENFAITS SUR NOS ANIMAUX Antiviral, antibactérien, antifongique (infections urinaires, candidas, staphs, levures) Stimule la production de cellules osseuses Puissant antioxydant Fait baisser la tension artérielle/vasodilatateur Anti-Arythmique Antihémorragique Aide a reduire la glycemie, le cholesterol, Soutient le système immunitaire Stimule le métabolisme Fébrifuge Vermifuge (en particulier la giardose) (1) Soulage les dermatites grâce à son effet détoxifiants Réduit les dommages oxydatifs dans le tractus gastro-intestinal Puissant anti-inflammatoire (fonctionne sur l'arthrose notamment) Combat le cancer (foie, prostate, colon, peau, mammaire) Lors de mes recherches pour la redaction de cet article, j'ai découvert qu'on pouvait notamment utiliser l'extrait de feuilles d'olivier dans le traitement de la FeLV et la FIV. PRECAUTIONS D’EMPLOI ET EFFETS SECONDAIRES Peut interférer avec certaines formes de chimio. Peut provoquer la réaction de Erx ou Herxheimer (en mourant les bactéries libèrent des toxines, donnant lieu à des symptômes allant des démangeaisons, jusqu’à empirer les symptômes de la maladie. Bien qu’il booste le système immunitaire, l’EFO contenant de très hauts niveaux d’antioxydants, il aurait des donc des effets positifs sur les maladies auto immunes, mais comme il existe peu de data sur ce sujet, dans le doute consultez un vétérinaire naturopathe. RECETTE DE L’EXTRAIT DE FEUILLE D’OLIVIER Si vous résidez dans une région méditerranéenne, vous avez ce qu’il faut sur le seuil de votre porte, mais assurez-vous que les arbres n’ont pas été du tout traités. Il ne faut pas non plus choisir un arbre dans une zone dont l’air est pollué, comme en bordure de route. C’est primordial car outre les vertus de la feuille d’olivier, vous en extirperez aussi les polluants ! Sélectionnez un type d’olivier européen, ce sont ceux dont le feuilles sont riches en oleuropéine, ce qui n’est pas les cas des oliviers venant de Chine. Cueillez les feuilles de préférence en milieu de matinée, lorsqu’elles n’ont plus aucune trace d’humidité ou de rosée matinale. Ne conservez que les feuilles saines sans aucune tache ni défaut, et préparez votre teinture dans l’heure qui suit la cueillette. Vous pouvez acheter des feuilles séchées, elles feront un produit acceptable, mais bien inférieur aux feuilles fraîches en qualité et vertus médicinales. Là encore, vérifiez la provenance. Vous aurez besoin de : Un bocal en avec fermeture hermétique, comme un bocal à conserve ou bocal à confitures. Surtout pas de plastique ! Un morceau de linge en coton propre et qui ne contient aucun résidu d’assouplisseur ou de javel, ou un coton/mousseline à fromage. Des petits flacons compte-goutte en verre coloré (ambré ou bleu) Une forme d’alcool à 40º comme de la vodka, de l’alcool pour fruits, du moment que c’est un alcool sans goût, la seule exception étant le rhum blanc (250ml par 100g de feuilles fraîches, le double si ce sont des feuilles sèches), ou Du vinaigre de cidre en même quantité. La solution obtenue devra macérer beaucoup plus longtemps. Après n’avoir conservé que les feuilles sans défauts, hachez-les menu ou passez-les à la moulinette. Mettez-les dans votre bocal en verre, préalablement lavé et stérilisé, et couvrez avec l’alcool. Fermez hermétiquement, et rangez dans un endroit sombre à température ambiante, mais où vous ne l’oublierez pas car il faut secouer le bocal tous les jours pendant la durée de la macération. Je mets mon bocal dans un étui à champagne sur mon comptoir de cuisine, avec un torchon sur le dessus du bocal pour comble le vide, comme ça je pense à le secouer tous les jours. Laissez macérer minimum 3 semaines si votre teinture est à base d’alcool, et 6 si elle est au vinaigre de cidre. UTILISATION En interne : 1 goutte de teinture mère par 3kg de poids corporel, par jour. Très amère, il vous faudra la diluer avec quelque chose pour couvrir le gout. Usage topique : Peut être utilisé pur sur la peau, pour soulager l’eczéma, les infections cutanées, les levures, etc. On peut aussi l’ajouter au shampoing, à de l’huile de noix de coco, du gel d’aloe Herbalgem Bourgeons d'Olivier Feuilles d'olivier - Teinture mere Herbiolys Feuilles d'olivier - gelules Sources : https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27876915 Toutes les œuvres présentes sur ce site appartiennent exclusivement à l’auteur (sauf mention contraire) aux termes des articles L111-1 et L112-2 du code de la propriété intellectuelle.Toute reproduction, diffusion publique, usage commercial sont, par conséquent, interdits sans autorisation du ou des titulaires des droits.

      "Selon les remèdes naturels que je vous recommande, pour calmer la toux chez un chien, voici quelques options :\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Teinture mère d'olive** : Vous pouvez utiliser 1 goutte de teinture mère d'olive (préparée suivant les instructions données plus haut) par 3kg de poids corporel du chien, une fois par jour. Vous pouvez la diluer avec un peu de water ou de lait si le goût est trop fort pour votre chien.\n",
      "2. **Gelule d'olive** : Si vous préférez utiliser des gelules, vous pouvez donner 1/4 à 1/2 gélule par 3kg de poids corporel du chien, une fois par jour. Assurez-vous que les gelules sont fabriquées avec des feuilles d'olive fraîches et non séchées.\n",
      "3. **Huile d'olive** : Vous pouvez également utiliser de l'huile d'olive pure (sans additifs ni aromas) pour calmer la toux de votre chien. Ajoutez 1 à 2 cuillères à soupe d'huile d'olive dans sa nourriture ou buvez-la avec lui. Cependant, assurez-vous que l'huile est sans additifs ni aromas pour éviter tout problème digestif.\n",
      "4. **Miel** : Le miel peut également aider à soulager la toux chez un chien. Vous pouvez donner 1 cuillère à soupe de miel pur (sans additifs ni sucre) par 3kg de poids corporel du chien, une fois par jour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Il est important de noter que si la toux persiste ou s'aggrave, il est recommandé de consulter un vétérinaire pour établir un diagnostic et proposer un traitement approprié.\n",

Outre leur contenu en fibres et en vitamines, ils contiennent aussi des minéraux, mais surtout des antioxydants qui jouent un rôle essentiel dans la prévention de nombreuses maladies, y compris le cancer. Puisque nous sommes en été, le fruit-légume dont j’aimerais vous parler c’est la pastèque. Passons sur le fait que son prix est dérisoire, c’est un fruit intéressant entre autres grâce à son contenu en lycopène, un pigment caroténoïde et puissant antioxydant qui combat les radicaux libres. Parmi ses vertus on compte : Protection contre les toxines contenues dans certains pesticides Inversion de certains dommages causés aux glandes endocriniennes et au foie (1) et (2). Des vertus antifongiques et antibactériennes qui ont fait l’objet d’études, notamment dans le traitement de la gingivite et de candida albican (3) et (4). Prevention et traitement des infections urinaires Traitement des calculs rénaux Prevention de l’hypertrophie de la prostate Vertus anticancéreuses ((prostate, poumons, estomac, pancréas, colon et rectum, œsophages, bouche, sein et cervix) (5) Protection contre certaines maladies du cœur Retardement de certains troubles oculaires liés à l’age. Cela ne veut pas pour autant dire que donner une tranche de pastèque a votre chien toute les jours va le guérir du cancer ou l’empêcher de faire de la gingivite, mais que cela peut contribuer à une meilleure santé en général et surtout en été c’est un excellent moyen de l’hydrater. Autres composants intéressants de la pastèque ce sont les acides aminés comme la citrulline qui est convertie en arginine par les reins. Cet acide aminé est important pour la santé cardiaque et le système immunitaire, mais a aussi fait l’objet de recherches montrant ses valeurs thérapeutiques potentielles dans de nombreuses conditions dont : La démence La fatigue L’hypertension Le diabète La fatigue musculaire La performance athlétique La pastèque contient aussi du tryptophane, de l’arginine, de l'acide glutamique et de la lysine, des acides aminés précurseurs métaboliques de la sérotonine, un neurotransmetteur qui joue un rôle important dans la régulation du moral et de l’humeur. Autrement dit, la pastèque c’est bon pour le moral ! Ce fruit-légume n’est pas le seul à posséder de nombreuses vertus, mais là où il diffère de beaucoup autres, c’est que comme avec le cochon : tout est bon dans le melon (d’eau) ! Comme de nombreuses personnes, vous devez certainement jeter les graines et la peau, ce qui est une grosse erreur ! La peau du melon d’eau est encore plus riche en lycopène et en citrulline que sa chair, et elle contient aussi de la chlorophylle, et des vitamines A, B1, B2, B3, B6, et des oligo-éléments comme le calcium, le fer, le magnésium le phosphore, le potassium et le zinc. Les graines sont-elles-aussi comestibles et riches de ces mêmes vitamines, minéraux et acides aminés, et contiennent beaucoup d’ga-6 (30g pour 100g de graines séchées. Profitez de l’été, et gardez les graines au congélateur, vous leur trouverez une utilisation cet hiver. VALEURS NUTRITIONNELLES EFFETS SECONDAIRES ET PRECAUTIONS La pasteque etant riche en glucide, la question peut se poser si c’est une si bonne idée de l’inclure a l’alimentation de votre chien. La bonne nouvelle c’est qu’elle est aussi tres riche en fibres et ces fibres ralentissent l’assimilation des glucides par le système digestif de votre chien, evitant ainsi la montée brutale de la glycemie (6). Comme pour beaucoup de choses, le moderation vient a l’esprit. Trop de pasteque peut provoquer des problemes intestinaux, comme pour tous les fruits et legumes d’ailleurs. Il est possible aussi que l'urine de votre chien soit un peu plus teinté, n’ayez aucune crainte, c’est juste du a son contenu en βcarotene. Alors venons-en au fait, pour améliorer l’ordinaire de votre chien grâce à la pastèque fraiche, voici quelques recettes qui vous permettront de faire aussi un excellent usage de toutes les parties de la pastèque, y compris la peau et des graines. Si votre pastèque est bio, vous pouvez tout utiliser. Si cela n’est pas le cas, à l’aide d’un épluche pomme-de-terres, ôter la partie verte du fruit, et ne conservez que la pulpe blanche. Attention : alors que la pulpe de la pastèque et relativement digeste, et peut être donnée à votre chien en cubes, la peau en revanche doit être réduite en purée. SMOOTHIE A LA PASTEQUE 500g de pastèque coupée en cubes (chair et/ou ecorce) 500ml de kéfir de lait, lait de noix de coco ou eau de coco (non sucrés bien sur) Mettez les ingrédients dans votre bol mixeur ou à smoothie et réduisez en purée. Vous pouvez le verser sur les croquettes de votre chien, ou lui donner comme ca. CREME GLACEE A LA PASTEQUE 350g de pastèque coupée en cubes 350ml de kéfir F2 Mettez vos cubes de pastèque au congélateur quelques heures, puis passez les a la moulinette. Y ajouter votre kéfir, bien mélanger puis passer à la sorbetière. Si vous n’avez pas de sorbetière, les fruits étant congelés, une fois réduits en purée, vous pouvez vous en passer. Verser dans des moules a esquimaux. SORBET A LA PASTEQUE 1 litre de pastèque réduite en purée ¼ de litre de jus de fruit bio sans sucre ajouté, ou eau de coco Pelez et coupez la pastèque en gros dés, et ôtez les graines (ou pas). Mettre au congélateur plusieurs heures. Lorsque les morceaux de pastèque sont congelés, les passer à la moulinette pour les réduire en purée. Y ajouter doucement le jus de fruit et continuer de mouliner. Vous obtiendrez alors un mélange homogène que vous pourrez verser dans un récipient ou faire des esquimaux pour vos chiens avec ; même pas besoin de sorbetière. JUS DE PASTEQUE Couper la pastèque en morceaux et mettez toutes les partie, peau (sauf la partie verte si la pastèque n’est pas bio) et graines comprises, dans votre extracteur. Le jus de pastèque est particulièrement indiqué en cas d’infection urinaire, de calculs rénaux, et pour prévenir l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Pour les 4 recettes ci-dessus, vous pouvez verser votre melange dans de petits moules en silicones pour en faire des friandises gelées. THÉ AUX GRAINES DE PASTEQUE 20 à 30 graines de pastèque Réduire les graines en poudre dans un moulin à épices, faire bouillir 15mn. Filtrer et laisser refroidir. Aussi indiqué pour le traitement des infections urinaires, calculs rénaux et l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Faire boire ce thé au chien pendant 2 jours, faire une pause le 3eme jour, et recommencer, toujours 2 jours sur 3. C’est un puissant diurétique et c’est aussi un laxatif, ne pas abuser. De nombreux sites font référence a une étude de 2014 sur le sujet, mais je ne suis pas parvenue à la trouver. PASTEQUE DESHYDRATEE Si votre pastèque n’est pas bio, pelez la partie verte. Coupez la pastèque en tranche de 1cm d’épaisseur. Oter la peau que vous réserverez pour un autre usage et coupez la chair de la pastèque en morceaux et essayer de récupérer les graines. Etalez les morceaux sur une grille au-dessus d’un récipient pour récupérer le jus, et laissez égoutter une petite heure. Epongez les avec un torchon propre ou du papier absorbant, et mettre dans le déshydrateur. Pour des morceaux de cette épaisseur, cela prend environ 8 à 10 heures à 55 degrés. Il est conseillé de retourner les morceaux de pastèque au bout de 6 heures pour que ça déshydrate bien des 2 cotés, et de ne pas trop les serrer car beaucoup d’humidité va s’en échapper. Vous aurez ainsi d’excellentes friandises qu’il ne faudra pas entasser les unes sur les autres car elles vont se coller. Séparez les a l’aide de papier sulfurisé, et n’en donnez pas trop à votre chien, c’est une confiserie. Mesdames et messieurs, a vos tabliers!

      "[2] (1.09) \u001b[31mwww.phyto-animaux.com 1 Plantes médicinales pour les animaux : lesquelles et comment les utiliser ? Après avoir passé en revue les diverses raisons motivant les propriétaires à se tourner vers les médecines complémentaires pour soigner leurs animaux (lire l'article : \"Remèdes naturels pour animaux : une bonne solution ?\"), voyons ensemble quelles sont les solutions concrètes qu'ils peuvent utiliser pour aider très efficacement leur compagnon. SOMMAIRE : 1. Les diverses médecines : y voir plus clair 2. Phytothérapie, aromathérapie et micronutrition (= nutrithérapie) 3. Qu'est-ce que la pharmacognosie ? 4. Notion de \"Totum\" de la plante 5. Différences importantes entre plantes et médicaments chimiques 6. Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ? 7. Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie 8. Concrètement : quelles sont les solutions faciles pour les animaux ? 9. Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales 10. Quelles plantes choisir pour les maladies ? 11. Les huiles essentielles d'aromathérapie : des précautions importantes 12. Conclusion xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 1. Les diverses médecines : y voir plus clair Les noms donnés aux médecines non traditionnelles sont nombreux et ces vocables regroupent beaucoup de médecines (ou de pseudo-médecines) différentes. On les appelle : - médecines \"douces\", mais ce terme ne convient pas car certaines d'entre elles sont tellement puissantes qu'elles sont loin d'être douces ! Par exemple : la phytothérapie peut faire appel à des plantes très toxiques comme la digitale, la belladone,.... ou comme le thuya pour venir à bout de certaines tumeurs ; quelques huiles essentielles de l'aromathérapie sont dermo-caustiques, etc. - médecines \"alternatives\" pour signifier qu'elles offrent le choix d'autres solutions que la médecine classique occidentale (appelée \"allopathie\") utilisant des traitements chimiques - médecines \"non conventionnelles\" car elles ne sont pas \"conventionnellement\" admises, prouvées ni reconnues par les autorités occidentales de santé - médecines \"naturelles\" car elles se basent le plus souvent sur des méthodes naturelles (plantes, massages, manipulations,....) - \"biothérapies\" car il s'agit aussi de thérapies pour la vie (\"bios\" en grec) www.phyto-animaux.com 2 - médecines complémentaires car elles peuvent être complémentaires des traitements classiques pour certaines maladies. Personnellement, les trois derniers vocables me semblent les plus appropriés, car ils signifient bien que médecine classique et médecine non conventionnelle ne s'opposent pas et peuvent même s'allier pour arriver à bout de certaines pathologies, offrant ainsi une solution naturelle, globale et plus efficace pour les soins et la guérison. Ces façons de traiter les problèmes de santé différemment sont très variées : phytothérapie, aromathérapie, micronutrition, homéopathie, acupuncture, médecine traditionnelle chinoise (MTC), ostéopathie, shiatzu, physiothérapie, kinésiologie,.... Remarque importante : Qu'elles soient qualifiées de \"douces\" ou de \"naturelles\", les médecines avec les plantes ne veulent pas dire \"sans danger\", car certaines plantes mal utilisées sont toxiques ! Dans le cadre du site de Phyto-animaux, nous évoquerons ici plus en détail 3 spécialités et leur définition : la phytothérapie, avec l'une de ses branches l'aromathérapie, ainsi que la micronutrition, aussi appelée nutrithérapie. 2. Phytothérapie, aromathérapie et micronutrition (= nutrithérapie) La phytothérapie est le fait de traiter, soulager et améliorer l'état de santé grâce aux plantes médicinales dont on commence à bien connaître les vertus thérapeutiques (par exemple la prêle comme reminéralisant pour les tendinites, l'harpagophytum comme anti-inflammatoire ostéo- articulaire, la mauve antispasmodique,...). Elles agissent comme compléments alimentaires à visée thérapeutique ou sont utilisées en usage externe. Les plantes peuvent s'utiliser sous beaucoup de formes différentes, chacune ayant leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients, surtout chez les animaux. Cet aspect sera évoqué dans le chapitre suivant. L'aromathérapie est une des branches de la phytothérapie, car elle fait appel aux plantes mais sous une forme particulière : les huiles essentielles. En fait, grâce au procédé d'hydrodistillation, on extrait les principes actifs des plantes (leurs molécules efficaces pour les traitements) qui vont se concentrer dans les huiles essentielles (HE). Vu la concentration parfois très élevée en molécules actives, certaines HE sont dangereuses, voir toxiques (dermocaustiques, abortives ou neurotoxiques,....). Les mélanges d'HE pour l'aromathérapie sont donc à faire préparer de préférence par des professionnels pour éviter les accidents. Pour la sécurité des animaux, nous les réserverons donc à un usage externe, sous forme diluée (voire très diluée) et de façon relativement réservée. La gemmothérapie est aussi une autre branche de la phytothérapie, qui fait appel aux plantes sous leur forme de bourgeons. On considère que le bourgeon de la plante regroupe en fait toutes les potentialités de la plante. Ils sont moins utilisés en phytothérapie vétérinaire. (L'ancien terme est \"phytoembryothérapie\"). www.phyto-animaux.com 3 La micronutrition, ou nutrithérapie, est le fait de traiter, soulager et améliorer l'état de santé par les nutriments, à savoir les minéraux, les oligo-éléments et les vitamines, dont on connaît aujourd'hui les rôles essentiels et leur importance dans la santé. En plus de pallier à d'éventuelles carences nutritionnelles (exemple : anémie due à un manque de fer, problèmes de peau dus à des carences en zinc,...), les nutriments peuvent aider l'animal à mieux récupérer lors de maladie, de convalescence, de vieillesse,.... 3. Qu'est-ce que la pharmacognosie ? La pharmacognosie est l'étude des principes actifs des plantes. Avec ces connaissances biochimiques récentes, on commence à connaître très précisément les actions pharmacologiques des plantes médicinales, ce qui fait avancer la phytothérapie et la fait sortir du simple domaine des \"rebouteux\" et autres remèdes de grand-mères empiriques, au profit des thérapeutes humains et vétérinaires. Ainsi, avec le développement de ces connaissances scientifiques sérieuses, on peut espérer que les traitements par les plantes soient un jour officiellement reconnus par la médecine classique (allopathie), acceptés et enseignés comme thérapies complémentaires. Etymologie : connaissance (\"gnosis\") du médicament (\"pharmakon\") Synonymes : phytochimie, phytobiochimie. 4. Notion de \"Totum\" de la plante : Une notion très importante en phytothérapie est celle de \"TOTUM\" de la plante. On considère que le totum est l'ensemble des molécules contenues dans la plante et qui permet à celle-ci d'avoir des propriétés médicinales efficaces. La plante forme donc une \"pharmacie globale\", une espèce de formule complète qui peut soigner, guérir, prévenir les maladies, d'où la notion de \"totum\". En effet, au niveau de sa composition chimique, on a constaté que la plante contient plusieurs principes actifs différents, dont les diverses actions sont complémentaires. Parfois même, ces molécules se potentialisent l'une l'autre. Si on utilise ces molécules isolées, on a une efficacité moindre que si on utilise toute la plante. Par exemple : si on extrait chimiquement l'harpagoside, la molécule active anti-inflammatoire de l'harpagophytum, on a une action anti-inflammatoire moindre que si on utilise toute la plante harpagophytum. D'où l'intérêt d'utiliser le plus possible la forme où la plante est présente dans sa totalité. 5. Différences importantes entre plantes et médicaments chimiques : Il faut bien avoir en tête que les plantes n'agissent pas exactement comme un médicament, même si leurs actions thérapeutiques sont réelles, voire parfois plus puissantes que les molécules chimiques. Leurs différences sont importantes : a) un médicament va en quelque sorte \"imposer\" son action sur l'organisme (si on ne veut pas dormir mais qu'on prend un somnifère, on dormira quand même), www.phyto-animaux.com 4 alors que la plante va plutôt \"proposer\" son action à l'organisme, sans rentrer dans un éventuel \"conflit\" métabolique (si on n'a pas besoin de vitamine C mais qu'on mange un citron, on ne va pas provoquer de situation problématique pour notre organisme ; mais si notre corps a justement une petite carence en vitamine C, la plante va lui en \"proposer\" et donc l'organisme va pouvoir se servir, en fonction de ses besoins). Les actions des plantes sont donc plus physiologiques sur l'organisme que les médicaments chimiques. Les plantes proposent, alors que les médicaments chimiques imposent. b) Le médicament utilise sur l'organisme plutôt un message de type quantitatif (dose-dépendant), alors que la plante envoie plutôt un message de type qualitatif (dose peu dépendante), ce qui explique notamment la raison pour laquelle il faut utiliser une petite quantité de plante pour voir une efficacité. Toujours pour reprendre l'exemple de la carence en vitamine C : manger un citron, quelques baies d'acérola ou quelques feuilles de persil sont amplement suffisants pour compenser ce manque. Et cet apport ne doit se faire que sur quelques jours pour que la carence disparaisse (il ne faut pas en prendre pendant des mois). Le médicament a une action quantitative, alors que la plante fonctionne plutôt sur un mode qualitatif (système de messagerie biologique). c) le médicament est le plus souvent composé d'une molécule active isolée (plus rarement 2 ou 3 molécules ensemble). Dans le cas de la plante, on utilise son totum, c'est-à-dire l'ensemble de ses molécules, ce qui permet leur synergie d'action. L'action de la plante est donc plus globale et plus efficace. d) le médicament est constitué de molécules chimiques, industriellement synthétisées, tandis que la plante est composées de substances naturelles et organiques, synthétisées par un être vivant (la plante) et disponibles pour un autre être vivant qui peut l'assimiler (l'animal). Cet aspect est important quand on sait que selon leur source de synthèse, les molécules peuvent avoir des conformations biochimiques dans l'espace différentes, ce qui a un impact réel sur leur efficacité. Par exemple : une molécule active peut être dextrogyre (D) ou lévogyre (L), un peu à la manière des gants, qui peuvent être gant gauche ou gant droit. Le plus souvent, la forme L est naturelle, alors que la forme D est synthétisée chimiquement, non reconnue ou mal utilisée par l'organisme. Si on utilise une forme D, le corps ne pourra pas bien l'utiliser. C'est comme si on imposait à une main droite de porter un gant gauche : cela ne fonctionnera pas. 6. Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ? Il existe de nombreuses formes de plantes, plus ou moins utilisables chez les animaux, avec un confort d'utilisation variable. De plus, suivant leur mode de fabrication, ces différentes présentations phytothérapeutiques conservent +/- bien les principes actifs (= les molécules efficaces) des plantes, permettant ou non l'assimilation du totum de la plante. Enfin, ces formes variées sont +/- compatibles les unes avec les autres ; c'est nécessaire à connaître si l'on veut faire des mélanges efficaces. www.phyto-animaux.com 5 Voyons ces différentes présentations, avec leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients : 1) les plantes fraîches : pas chez les animaux - forme peu pratique car il faut des connaissances botaniques parfaites pour ne pas se tromper dans leur reconnaissance et leur cueillette - odeur et goût trop forts (éventuellement valable chez le cheval) - conservation très limitée (car la plante fraîchement coupée fermente et pourrit très rapidement). 2) les plantes sèches en \"morceaux\" : peu pratique pour les animaux - ces plantes sont grossièrement découpées (par exemple des feuilles \"mondées\") - elles sont plutôt utilisées pour les tisanes en infusion ou en décoction (formes peu pratiques chez les animaux ; voir Chapitre 8). 3) les poudres de plantes sèches : forme la plus pratique pour les animaux réunissant plusieurs avantages, la poudre de plantes sèches est la forme la plus adéquate pour les animaux : - la partie de la plante utilisée est \"complète\", ce qui garantit d'avoir le \"totum\" de la plante - la concentration des principes actifs est naturelle (donc ni trop concentrée, ni trop diluée) - la transformation des plantes est réduite au minimum (cueillette + séchage), permettant la meilleure conservation des principes actifs qui ne vont donc pas être modifiés ou même dénaturés par diverses manipulations (distillation, extraction à l'alcool,...) - la forme sèche est stable et se conserve très bien dans de bonnes conditions (dans un pot en verre à l'abri de l'humidité) - les diverses poudres sont faciles à mélanger ; on peut donc aisément combiner plusieurs plantes pour obtenir toutes les actions désirées ; on peut aussi y rajouter des nutriments, se trouvant aussi le plus souvent aussi sous forme de poudres, ce qui facilite les mélanges (par exemple : un mélange contenant une plante anti-inflammatoire + une plante diurétique + une plante anti- œdème + du fer + vitamine C + vitamine B9) - l'odeur des mélanges de plantes n'est pas trop fort (il faut éviter certaines plantes comme le radis noir, la fumeterre,... mais ces plantes n'ont pas été retenues par Phyto-animaux pour les mélanges pour nos compagnons, et elles ne sont pas non plus présentes dans le listing des plantes en vrac proposées sur le site) - le goût est parfois un peu amer, mais pour les chiens et les chats, on peut mélanger cela avec de la pâté ou une \"ration maison\" (viande + féculent + légumes + jus de viande)* - le goût amer ne pose quasiment pas de problème chez les chevaux, habitués à manger des plantes ; pour les animaux un peu difficiles, on peut rajouter une poignée de graines avec un peu de jus de pomme (une fiche conseil est distribuée avec chaque phyto-préparation) - cette forme a le coût le moins cher et permet la meilleure adaptation du mélange à la maladie de son animal (personnalisation de la formule facile et efficace). * Dans la pratique, on observe depuis longtemps que si l'animal met parfois 1 ou 2 jours avant d'accepter le mélange, il le prend ensuite volontiers, comme si son organisme lui indique que ce mélange est bon pour lui et répond réellement à un besoin physiologique. De plus, on constate aussi souvent qu'après une période plus ou moins longue (15 jours, 3 semaines), l'animal commence à rechigner au mélange, comme si son organisme comprend que son corps n'en a plus besoin. www.phyto-animaux.com 6 4) les extraits fluides classiques : pas chez les animaux - les principes actifs des plantes sont extraits par plusieurs procédés successifs dans de l'alcool éthylique ; or il vaut mieux éviter tout solvant alcoolique pour nos compagnons - même si la conservation est bonne, le manque de choix des plantes et le coût souvent élevé de cette forme sont des inconvénients importants. 5) les extrait phyto-standardisés = EPS : forme utilisée chez les animaux - ils sont aussi appelés extraits fluides glycérinés - il s'agit d'une présentation liquide de plantes, traitées par le froid, subissant des extractions successives dans de l'eau et de l'alcool, puis après évaporation du solvant, il y a remise en suspension dans une solution glycérinée pour la conservation (glycérine = glycérol = alcool neutre faiblement toxique) - les principes actifs sont très dilués - la conservation est bonne, mais le manque de choix des plantes et le coût élevé de cette forme sont des inconvénients importants, ainsi que les quantités minimales importantes (flacons d' 1/2 litre pour chaque plante) - le goût parfois trop fort de certains EPS en limite l'usage chez les animaux (et les chats ne l'apprécient pas souvent) 6) les suspensions intégrales de plantes fraîches = SIPF : pas chez les animaux - il s'agit d'une présentation liquide de plantes, traitées par la froid puis mises en suspension dans l'alcool à 30°, ce qui n'est pas une forme adéquate pour les animaux - les principes actifs sont très dilués - la conservation est bonne, mais le manque de choix des plantes et le coût élevé de cette forme sont des points négatifs. 7) les extraits secs : pas chez les animaux - les principes actifs des plantes sont extraits par plusieurs procédés successifs dans de l'alcool éthylique ou dans de l'eau, puis on élimine le solvant pour obtenir une forme solide et sèche - ATTENTION : il ne faut surtout pas confondre cette forme avec les poudres de plantes sèches ! En effet, par cette méthode, les plantes subissent plusieurs manipulations parfois \"agressives\", dénaturant les principes actifs les plus fragiles des plantes ainsi traitées (ce qui n'est pas le cas des poudres de plantes sèches qui, elles, sont très peu manipulées et donc bien conservées \"en l'état\") - une mauvaise conservation et un prix élevé sont des inconvénients importants - les principes actifs sont très concentrés, rendant cette forme dangereuse pour les animaux, sensibles à une trop forte concentration des molécules actives. 8) les teintures-mères = TM, les teintures officinales ou les alcoolatures : pas chez les animaux - les plantes (sèches ou fraîches) sont macérées dans de l'alcool - les principes actifs sont très dilués www.phyto-animaux.com 7 - malgré la très grande variété de plantes disponibles et son coût très faible, cette forme n'est pas conseillé pour un usage chez les animaux à cause du solvant alcoolique. - (NB : teintures officinales et alcoolatures sont des formes anciennes qui ont presque disparu). 9) les huiles essentielles = HE : forme pratique mais à usage externe et avec certaines précautions d'emploi (voir Paragraphe 11) - les plantes subissent une hydrodistillation (distillation grâce à de la vapeur d'eau dans un alambic), concentrant ainsi une partie des principes actifs - ceux qui sont entraînés par la vapeur d'eau - dans des solutions \"huileuses\" qu'on appelle huiles essentielles (HE) et qui sont utilisées en aromathérapie - ces formes sont liposolubles ; elles ne se mélangent donc pas dans l'eau ou avec toute autre forme hydrosoluble (teintures-mère, hydrolats,...) - les principes actifs qui se trouvent dans les HE sont hautement concentrés, rendant leur utilisation très dangereuse chez les animaux pour qui n'a pas de connaissances solides en aromathérapie - ces formes liposolubles favorisent la toxicité de certaines HE sur le tissu nerveux, la toxicité digestive, les risques allergiques, la dermocausticité,... - NB : ce procédé d'extraction permet également l'obtention des hydrolats (voir paragraphe suivant) - IMPORTANT : PAS d'HE pour le CHAT car il ne les supporte pas (beaucoup sont toxiques pour lui et les quelques HE non toxiques le font baver intensément, ce qui n'est pas grave mais qui est très impressionnant pour le propriétaire et perturbant pour l'animal) (Lire aussi le Chapitre 11). 10) les hydrolats ou eaux florales : utile chez les animaux, surtout pour les chats - le procédé d'extraction des plantes est également l'hydrodistillation, mais on récupère la phase aqueuse pour obtenir les hydrolats - une partie des principes actifs de la plante sont présents, et hautement dilués - contrairement aux HE : ils ont une très faible toxicité et cette forme est hydrosoluble - leur utilisation est très pratique pour le chat chez qui les huiles essentielles sont déconseillées - leur coût est le plus souvent très abordable - malheureusement, la variété des plantes disponibles sous forme d'hydrolats est relativement faible (par rapport aux plantes sèches). 11) les bourgeons : peu utilisé pour les animaux - l'utilisation des bourgeons de plantes s'appelle la gemmothérapie - le bourgeon de la plante est mis en macération dans un solvant contenant de l'alcool et de la glycérine puis il est filtré ; on obtient alors un macérat concentré ou macérat-mère - par le passé, ce macérat-mère était ensuite dilué 10 fois dans un mélange eau/alcool/glycérine nommé macérat glycériné 1D (dilution à 1/10) ; il n'est plus trop utilisé actuellement - les principes actifs sont très dilués - comme il y a peu de références, cela ne donne pas beaucoup de choix de plantes. 12) les macérats (huileux): peu utilisé pour les animaux www.phyto-animaux.com 8 - il s'agit de plantes que l'on fait macérer plus ou moins longtemps dans une huile végétale (par exemple de l'huile de millepertuis, de l'huile de noisette,...) - c'est un type de préparation ancestrale, une méthode moins utilisée de nos jours - suivant l'huile végétale utilisée, le problème de conservation peut se poser - les principes actifs sont très dilués et ne sont pas en quantités connues ; cela ne permet donc pas d'avoir des préparations standardisées et fiables. 13) les fleurs de Bach : peu utilisé pour les animaux - elles sont aussi appelés élixirs floraux - il s'agit d'une forme liquide de certaines plantes - la variété des plantes est relativement restreinte - le choix de la plante se base sur des critères psychologiques et des symptômes émotionnels ; des réserves sont donc à émettre par rapport à leur utilisation chez les animaux, puisque les comportements sont différents de ceux des humains Commentaires pour la méthode des fleurs de Bach : le choix de la fleur de Bach pour le traitement est surtout lié à l'état psychologique de l'animal, mais cette façon de procéder pose question quant à son efficacité car : - au départ, les fleurs de Bach ont été élaborées pour des maladies humaines ; le fait de transposer cela aux maladies animales est une erreur énorme et fréquente - il peut y avoir un défaut d'appréciation de la situation psychologique de l'animal par son propriétaire (l'animal ne parle pas) - il y a des erreurs d'interprétation de son comportement, notamment car l'observateur peut avoir une mauvaise connaissance des comportements normaux chez les animaux (par exemple, on pense que le chien qui lèche la main après une punition veut se faire pardonner, mais en fait il récupère son statut de dominant !) - on peut toujours faire - même inconsciemment - une projection anthropomorphique sur l'animal (le propriétaire pense que son animal est déprimé, alors qu'en fait, c'est lui qui est déprimé) - on peut constater que certaines plantes utilisées sous forme de fleurs de Bach pour certaines maladies ne correspondent pas à l'utilisation classique de cette plante en phytothérapie. Il y a donc parfois non similarité d'action d'une plante entre sa forme d'élixir floral et sa forme d'utilisation classique (plante sèche, teinture-mère ou autre). Cela pose question quant à l'efficacité des fleurs de Bach, surtout quand la pharmacognosie (étude biochimique des principes actifs) donne de bonnes explications scientifiques pour la phytothérapie, mais pas pour les fleurs de Bach. En conclusion : Les formes de plantes les plus adéquates comme compléments alimentaires pour les animaux sont : - de préférence : les poudres de plantes sèches ; les hydrolats et les huiles essentielles pour l'usage externe uniquement (et avec beaucoup de précautions) - éventuellement : les EPS (et les macérats de bourgeons) www.phyto-animaux.com 9 Remarque : certaines plantes n'existent que sous forme sèche et d'autres qu'en tant qu'huiles essentielles, ce qui explique la complémentarité de l'utilisation des plantes avec de la phytothérapie et de l'aromathérapie. Certaines formes peuvent être utilisées chez les animaux, mais avec beaucoup de préparations ou de précautions d'utilisation (teintures-mères, plantes fraîches). Pour les autres formes, elles ne sont pas retenues pour les animaux, soit parce que leur utilisation ou leur efficacité pose problème, soit parce que leur forme n'est pas adaptée aux animaux, soit parce que leur gamme n'est pas assez développée ou trop chère (plantes sèches grossièrement coupées, extraits fluides, extraits secs, SIPF, macérats huileux, fleurs de Bach). 7. Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie a) Particularités des animaux suivant leur régime alimentaire : Les carnivores ont un régime de base carné, ce qui fait qu'ils fonctionnent sur un \"mode acide\" (pH inférieur à 7, allant de 5,5 à 6,5). A l'opposé, les herbivores tels le cheval, se nourrissent exclusivement de végétaux et leur organisme travaille plutôt sur un \"mode alcalin\" (alcalin = basique = inverse de l'acide ; pH supérieur à 7 et allant jusqu'à 8,5). Entre les 2, les omnivores que sont l'homme et le porc, se nourrissant aussi bien de viande que de végétaux, ont un mode d'activité métabolique agissant sur un niveau neutre (pH aux alentours de 7). Cette différence de niveau d'acidité résultant directement de l'alimentation est essentiel, car cela implique pour chaque espèce des mécanismes spécifiques, aussi bien pour les fonctions métaboliques que pour les réactions de défense par rapport aux pathogènes (microbes, bactéries, parasites,....). Quelques exemples : - normalement, l'acidité du cérumen des oreilles protège naturellement les chiens et les chats des parasites microscopiques provoquant la gale d'oreilles ; mais comme les chiens ou chats nourris aux croquettes ont un régime alimentaire trop alcalin (les céréales alcalines constituent la base des croquettes), leur cérumen des oreilles n'est alors pas assez acide et ils développent plus facilement cette maladie. Le nettoyage des oreilles avec une solution légèrement acide, ainsi qu'une alimentation adaptée (et naturellement acide comme la viande, la sauce tomate, le yaourt,...) va alors tout faire rentrer dans l'ordre (HE de lavande vraie pour le chien, la forme hydrolat pour le chat). - la majorité des calculs urinaires chez les carnivores sont plutôt de type alcalin (car croquettes trop alcalines) ; le traitement consistera à rectifier l'alimentation et à donner des plantes acidifiantes (canneberge,...). - les chevaux fonctionnent normalement sur le mode alcalin ; or beaucoup de maladies résultent d'une acidité temporaire (par exemple : trop de grains ou les jeunes pousses d'herbes trop vertes fermentent et enflamment la paroi de l'estomac, ce qui provoque des gastrites et ulcères gastriques). Un traitement utilisant des nutriments et/ou des plantes alcalinisantes permet de résoudre rapidement beaucoup de cas. (Vous pouvez aussi lire l'article \"Problèmes d'oreilles chez les chiens et les chats\"). www.phyto-animaux.com 10 b) Très grande variation de taille et de poids selon les animaux : Chez tous les animaux, on est confronté à une très grande variation de poids et de taille suivant l'espèce ou la race. Exemples : Pour les chiens, on peut aller du mini-Chihuahua de 500 g (vous lisez bien !) au Terre Neuve pouvant atteindre 80 kilos. Pour les chats, on va de mini-gabarits de 2 kg à certains très grands (gros) chats plafonnant à 10 - 12 kg. Les chevaux ne sont pas en reste, puisque le petit Falabella de quelques dizaines de kg fait partie de la même espèce équine que les superbes chevaux de traits atteignant 1 tonne ! Et même les bovins ont une très grande variété de poids, allant de 500 kg en moyenne pour une vache à près de 2 tonnes pour les taureaux les plus lourds. La conséquence est directe : il y a difficulté pour fixer la posologie ! Par chance, comme dit précédemment (voir Chapitre 5: \"Différences importantes entre plantes et médicaments chimiques\"), les plantes fonctionnent avec un mode de messagerie de type qualitatif, ce qui simplifie parfois ce problème de poids chez les animaux car on est moins \"dose-dépendant\" en phytothérapie qu'en pharmacie chimique classique. Ainsi par exemple, pour un mélange de plantes sèches pour un gros chien de 60 kg ou un cheval de 600 kg, la posologie sera de 15 g/jour en dose d'entretien, alors que la variation de poids entre ces deux animaux est d'un facteur 10 ! Ce problème de posologie ayant une conséquence directe sur l'utilisation de la phytothérapie, ce point sera abordé plus en détail dans le Chapitre 9 : \"Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales\". c) Olfaction et gustation : Les animaux ont un sens de l'olfaction particulièrement développé, surtout chez les carnivores. Or comme ils se servent de leur odorat pour accepter ou non telle ou telle nourriture, la moindre substance \"suspecte\" dans leur alimentation les feront rechigner à l'avaler. D'autant plus quand leur sens du goût confirmera leur suspicion, et c'est le cas avec les plantes, puisque leur amertume est parfois assez marquée. Cela peut évidemment être un frein quant à l'utilisation de la phytothérapie chez nos compagnons à 4 pattes. Néanmoins, les remèdes par les plantes sont tellement efficaces, et parfois sont les seules solutions disponibles pour certaine maladies que cela vaut vraiment le coup d'insister un peu pour arriver à les faire avaler à nos animaux. Que ce soit en les mélangeant avec leur nourriture, ou en rusant par l'incorporation avec une gourmandise qu'ils ne refuseront pas, ces traitements seront quand même ingurgités. www.phyto-animaux.com 11 Evidemment, la prise orale de mélanges phytothérapeutiques est plus facile chez les herbivores de par leur habitude à manger des plantes. Il est très intéressant de signaler que le plus souvent, après 1 ou 2 jours, on assiste à une acceptation fréquente de ces plantes, un peu comme si l'animal fait rapidement le lien entre le goût un peu bizarre et le bénéfice pour son organisme. Enfin, dans les phyto-préparations de Phyto-animaux, l'ajout de nutriments parfois appétents pour compléter \"la formule\" aide le mélange à être plus facilement ingéré. Le problème de l'olfaction est surtout plus important pour les huiles essentielles, puisque c'est justement cette particularité qui est caractéristique des HE, grâce à la très haute concentration en principes actifs. Si leur usage oral est déconseillé (ou à réserver aux spécialistes en aromathérapie vétérinaire), l'ingestion accidentelle est fréquente, surtout chez les carnivores. En effet, que ce soit le chien qui veut se débarrasser d'une pommade \"qui sent trop mauvais sur sa peau\" ou le chat qui fait sa toilette quotidienne, il arrive souvent que les huiles essentielles atterrissent sur le palais de nos compagnons. D'où l'intérêt d'utiliser les HE les moins toxiques possibles, et sous une forme diluée adéquate, limitant le risque toxique en cas d'ingestion, même non voulue. d) Métabolisation : Le cas du chat : La métabolisation est le processus de transformations des molécules en une forme qui permet leur élimination définitive par le corps. Cette métabolisation concerne aussi bien les déchets de l'organisme que les substances \"étrangères\" ingérées comme les médicaments, les plantes,... La métabolisation se fait essentiellement par le foie, d'où l'intérêt que cet organe soit fonctionnel tout le temps, impliquant un drainage régulier (minimum une fois par an ; lire les 2 articles concernant le \"Drainage de l'organisme\"). Chez les animaux comme chez l'homme, ces transformations se font en plusieurs étapes, grâce à diverses réactions biochimiques et selon des processus complexes. Pour résumer très simplement ces étapes, on peut dire que la métabolisation se passe en 2 grandes phases (la phase I et la phase II), elles-mêmes constituées de plusieurs grandes voies de transformation dont 2 principales (glucuronoconjugaison et sulfonoconjugaison). Si le métabolisme du chien et du cheval est très similaire à celui de l'homme, le chat constitue une exception très problématique, puisqu'il n'a, lui, qu'une seule de ces 2 voies qui fonctionne vraiment, ce qui le rend très sensible à beaucoup de substances qui sont très vite toxiques pour lui. Un exemple très révélateur : l'aspirine a son temps de demi-vie (sa vitesse d'élimination en quelque sorte) de 6 heures chez le chien ou chez l'homme, mais elle est de 36 h chez le chat, donc cela prend 6 fois plus de temps pour le chat de se débarrasser de ce principe actif ! Il est alors compréhensible que si le chat absorbe chaque jour (toutes les 24 h) une dose d'aspirine, il n'aura non seulement pas le temps de l'éliminer, mais en plus, il va l'accumuler, ce qui explique sa toxicité chez l'espèce féline ! www.phyto-animaux.com 12 Et chez le chat, c'est le cas pour tout un tas de substances, notamment beaucoup de molécules contenues dans les huiles essentielles (composants benzéniques, substances à noyau aromatique, phénols,...). Les animaux malades, vieux, sous traitement,... : Il est évident que les animaux vieux et/ou malades ont des organes affaiblis, notamment le foie et les reins, ce qui freine d'autant la métabolisation et l'élimination des molécules étrangères. Chez eux, il faut en tenir compte, même s'ils n'ont pas de symptômes correspondants (on peut avoir un foie \"fatigué\" sans pour autant être jaune d'ictère), notamment en choisissant des plantes adéquates, éventuellement drainantes, et en adaptant la posologie à leur cas. e) Elimination : Après la métabolisation, il y a élimination des déchets définitifs, qui se fait essentiellement par voie rénale. Pour rappel, le foie et les reins sont 2 émonctoires importants. Le problème, c'est que les reins sont un vrai point faible chez les carnivores (pour avoir une idée, 30% des chats décèdent d'insuffisance rénale). Il faut donc éviter de surcharger le travail de ces organes, en choisissant des plantes adéquates et en évitant des plantes ou des traitements inutiles, longs, lourds, ce qui est un argument de poids pour le principe de base de la phytothérapie : préférer des cures courtes et discontinues, pour justement éviter d'alourdir le travail de ces organes de métabolisation et d'élimination (voir Chapitre 9 : \"Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales\"). 8. Concrètement : quelles sont les solutions faciles pour les animaux ? En ayant bien en tête les diverses formes de plantes utilisables en phytothérapie (lire le Chapitre 6 : \"Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ?\"), on peut alors choisir les formes d'administration les plus adéquates pour les animaux. a. Le mélange de plantes sèches : Pour les animaux, c'est la meilleure solution car c'est la formule la plus facile, la plus pratique, la plus efficace et la moins chère. Cela permet de choisir les plantes qui conviennent à la maladie, en adaptant exactement le choix de ces plantes aux diverses actions recherchées. Par exemple : en cas de tendinite avec œdème, on va mélanger une plante anti-inflammatoire, avec une plante diurétique (drainage rénal), une plante anti-oedème, et une plante redonnant de l'élasticité aux tendons. Pour être le plus efficace possible, il faut de préférence connaître la cause du problème, et éventuellement comprendre la façon dont la pathologie s'installe (on appelle cela la pathogénie). Cela permet de choisir les plantes qui pourront freiner ou bloquer ces processus menant à la maladie, ou même cela pourra parfois empêcher la cause d'apparaître. Exemple : si un animal fait des tendinites à répétitions suite à un manque d'élasticité des tendons, on pourra empêcher le problème en redonnant de la souplesse à ces structures élastiques. www.phyto-animaux.com 13 Le fait qu'énormément de plantes existent sous forme de poudres sèches offre un nombre de possibilités quasi illimité pour l'élaboration de compléments alimentaires adaptés à presque toutes les situations. Et c'est une forme d'autant plus intéressante que la plupart des nutriments sont aussi sous une forme sèche, ce qui permet de combiner phytothérapie et micronutrition dans un même mélange, augmentant nettement l'efficacité du remède. C'est une formule très avantageuse quand on a un animal qui cumule les maladies, car les traitements peuvent s'additionner dans une même phyto-préparation. Exemple : si votre vieux chien atteint d'arthrose a un foie un peu fatigué et qu'il a un léger œdème pulmonaire, il peut bénéficier d'un seul mélange de plantes qui l'aidera pour ces 3 pathologies. En effet, on associera des nutriments et des plantes qui aideront son arthrose, draineront son foie et seront diurétiques pour diminuer œdème. De plus, comme elle est composée de plantes, contenant donc des substances naturelles, cette phyto-préparation ne surchargera pas son organisme. La prise quotidienne est relativement aisée car la quantité de poudres à avaler chaque jour n'est pas importante et qu'elle peut être mélangée à la nourriture (pâté, ration maison,...). La conservation de cette forme est longue si on garde ces mélanges de préférence dans des pots en verre, à l'abri de l'humidité. b. Les tisanes et décoctions : Il s'agit de faire infuser une plante ou un mélange de plantes dans de l'eau chaude, la décoction durant un peu plus de temps que l'infusion car elle concerne des plantes de forme plus \"solide\" (branchages, racines,...). A cause de l'odeur et du goût fortement augmentés dans les formes tisanes ou décoctions (à cause de la chaleur de la préparation), ces 2 procédés sont à éviter chez les animaux. Ces formes obligent à des manipulations plus importantes et une contrainte de temps non négligeable pour un traitement quotidien (chauffer l'eau, attendre l'infusion, attendre que cela refroidisse,...). La durée de conservation de ces préparations est très limitée car elles doivent être consommées dans les 2 à 3 heures qui suivent. De plus, on ne peut pas les conserver pour le lendemain - même au frigo - car l'eau favorise la multiplication microbienne rapide. Enfin, les plantes utilisables pour cette forme (feuilles grossièrement coupées, fleurs plus ou moins volumineuses, racines en morceaux,...) sont plus volumineuses et plus difficiles à conserver que les poudres sèches. Donc pour résumer, cette formule est à oublier pour les animaux car elle est peu pratique et accumule les désavantages : manipulation importante, contrainte de temps, conservation ultra- limitée, goût et odeur trop fortes pour les animaux, plantes plus difficiles à garder,... c. Le sirop d'EPS : Il s'agit du même principe que le mélange de plantes sèches, mais sous une forme différente : les extraits glycérinés. www.phyto-animaux.com 14 Le mélange de plantes constitue alors un sirop plus ou moins facile à faire avaler, car il se mélange difficilement à la ration et il faut donc le faire avaler à la seringue. Chez le chat, cette forme est très problématique car il n'apprécie pas d'être forcé à avaler un sirop souvent trop fort pour lui. C'est la même remarque pour un chien ou un cheval qui ne se laissera pas faire. Comme il s'agit d'une forme liquide, on ne peut pas envisager de l'additionner à des nutriments (sous forme de poudres), ce qui empêche la complémentarité pratique de la phytothérapie et de la micronutrition dans un même remède. Les désavantages de cette solution sont divers : goût souvent trop fort, palette de choix de plantes limitée, coût relativement élevé (par rapport aux poudres sèches) et difficulté de s'approvisionner en petites quantités, difficulté à l'utiliser chez le chat ou chez tout ... Néanmoins, c'est une alternative à éventuellement essayer puisque les solutions phytothérapeutiques ne sont pas nombreuses pour nos animaux. d. Les pommades ou les solutions huileuses avec des huiles essentielles : Elles sont à réserver pour un usage externe uniquement. Leur efficacité est très grande si le choix des HE est judicieux et adaptée à la maladie à traiter. Mais comme beaucoup d'HE sont toxiques, dermocaustiques,... il vaut mieux bien se renseigner ou utiliser des préparations vétérinaires sûres. Comme l'usage des HE relève de l'aromathérapie, une branche plus spécifique de la phytothérapie, les conseils et les précautions d'utilisation sont développées plus en détails dans le Chapitre 11 : \"Les huiles essentielles en aromathérapie : des précautions importantes\". Les autres formes de plantes sont à oublier car trop peu pratiques pour diverses raisons chez les animaux (voir le Chapitre 6 : \"Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ?\"). 9. Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales : La très grande variation de poids et de taille suivant l'espèce ou la race peut poser problème en phytothérapie vétérinaire, comme on l'a vu dans le Chapitre 7 (\"Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie\") au paragraphe b (\"Très grande variation de taille et de poids selon les animaux\"), De plus, le choix des formes de plantes utilisées peut faire varier la dose pour les animaux (voir Chapitre 6 + Chapitre 8). La fixation de la posologie résulte donc de plusieurs facteurs : - l'espèce animale - le poids de l'animal - la forme de plante choisie - la durée du traitement. www.phyto-animaux.com 15 LES COMBINAISONS POUVANT ÊTRE INFIMES, NOUS ALLONS RÉSUMER ICI LES GRANDES LIGNES PRINCIPALES, UTILES, PRATIQUES ET EFFICACES CONCERNANT LA POSOLOGIE EN PHYTOTHÉRAPIE VÉTÉRINAIRE.  Posologies habituelles par voie orale pour un mélange de plantes : a) le mélange de plantes sèches : c'est la forme la plus pratique d'utilisation de la phytothérapie, que ce soit pour les chiens, les chats ou les chevaux. CHAT : 3 à 5 g/ jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chat (soit 1/2 à 1 petite cuillère à café) CHIEN : - 5 g/jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chien de moins de 10 kg (soit 1 cuillère à café) - 10 g/jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chien de 10 à 30 kg (soit 2 cuillères à café) - 15 g/jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chien de plus de 30 kg (soit 1 cuillère à soupe) CHEVAL : - poney, petit cheval, âne (+/- 200 kg) : 10 g/jour (soit 2 cuillères à café) - cheval moyen (500 kg) : 15 g/jour (soit 1 cuillère à soupe) - grand cheval (700-800 kg) : 20 g/jour (soit 4 cuillères à café) Il s'agit de la posologie classique pour une dose d'entretien. Si nécessaire, notamment en cas de problème grave, ou pour rapidement atteindre une efficacité (par exemple en cas de douleur importante), on peut donner une dose d'attaque en doublant ces quantités journalières pendant les 4 ou 5 premiers jours de traitement. b) Une autre forme est éventuellement le sirop d'EPS : La posologie classique d'entretien est : - pour les chiens et chats : 1 ml par 5 kg et par jour (maximum 5 ml/jour pour les gros chiens) - pour les chevaux : 15 ml pour 400 kg, habituellement une fois par jour. Si nécessaire, on peut donner cette dose 2 à 3 fois par jour, mais il faudra alors diluer le sirop avec de l'eau. L'inconvénient est qu'il faut de préférence faire avaler à la seringue car l'odeur et le goût sont trop forts pour nos compagnons. Chez le chat ou l'animal difficile, cette solution est à oublier car il ne se laissera pas faire, en tout cas pas durant toute la durée du traitement. www.phyto-animaux.com 16  Durée des traitements habituels avec les plantes : En phytothérapie, il y a une grand principe de base qui est celui que tout traitement phytothérapeutique doit se faire en cures relativement courtes et discontinues. En effet, il ne faut normalement jamais faire de cures longues et continues sur plusieurs mois, car soit c’est inutile, soit cela risque de déséquilibrer l’organisme, soit cela va surcharger les organes de métabolisation et d'élimination (le foie et les reins ; lire le Chapitre 7 : \"Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie\"). La nature n'aime pas le \"trop peu\", mais elle n'aime pas le \"trop\" non plus. Pour préserver et favoriser la santé, il faut un juste milieu. Durée et Fréquence conseillées : - en cas de maladie classique : 1 cure de 7 à 10 jours par mois - quand la maladie est chronique ou que le cas est plus grave : => soit une cure plus longue de 10 à 15 jours (à reprendre éventuellement 10 jours plus tard) => soit 1 cure à faire 1 semaine sur 2. Malheureusement, ce principe n'est pas souvent respecté par les firmes vendant des traitements à base de plantes, puisqu'elles préconisent erronément des traitements longs et continus. En effet, ainsi elles vendent toujours plus, pour des raisons purement financières. Ces raisons vénales sont condamnables d'un point de vue éthique, moral et vétérinaire, puisque ces \"suremplois\" de plantes peuvent favoriser des déséquilibres de l'organisme, parfois tout aussi néfastes et dommageables pour le corps que la maladie primitivement traitée. Quelques exemples de problèmes avec des cures longues et continues : - donner non stop des probiotiques aux chevaux favorise les fermentations intestinales, et donc augmente très dangereusement le risque de coliques, une pathologie gravissime chez nos équidés - l'usage prolongé d'ail ou de reine des prés chez les chevaux favorise la fluidification du sang, pouvant déboucher sur des problèmes sérieux de micro-hémorragies ou d'hématomes très problématiques s'ils se trouvent dans le pied, pouvant mener à de la fourbure (lire l'article complet : \"Fourbure\") - l'utilisation de plantes diurétiques à long terme va littéralement \"assécher\" l'organisme, avec à terme des pertes hydriques et électrolytiques conséquentes sur l'organisme (par exemple une hypokaliémie provoquant des troubles cardiaques, des troubles nerveux et musculaires, de l'épilepsie secondaire,....) - certaines plantes contiennent beaucoup de minéraux utiles à l'organisme, mais toxiques en cas de surdosage (hypercalcémie, hyperkaliémie, calculs urinaires, calculs biliaires,...) www.phyto-animaux.com 17 - l'ortie, très intéressante en phytothérapie, contient aussi de l'histamine, une molécule stimulant l'immunité mais favorisant les allergies si l'organisme en est surchargé. Et les exemples de ce type sont légion, illustrant bien la nécessité de respecter la physiologie et de ne donner au corps que ce dont il a besoin. C'est ce qu'on résume avec le principe de cures courtes et discontinues. 10. Quelles plantes choisir pour quelles maladies ? Pour arriver à préparer un mélange de plantes qui sera efficient pour votre animal, il vous faudra connaître surtout 2 choses très importantes : 1) la maladie de votre animal, la cause de son problème et sa pathogénie (le processus d'installation et de développement du mal) 2) les diverses plantes et leurs actions respectives, ainsi que les molécules qui les composent (pour éviter les toxicités, les problèmes de métabolisation chez le chat,...). Chacun de ces deux points pouvant à lui seul représenter un gros ouvrage, il est donc évident qu'il n'est pas possible ici, dans un simple article, de parcourir toutes les maladies des animaux de compagnie, de décrire tous les traitements phytothérapeutiques possibles grâce aux plantes et d'établir la correspondance entre les deux. Cela représente un travail conséquent - qui est en cours - et qui fera l'objet de publications dans les mois qui viennent. En effet, 2 livres sont actuellement en préparation, l'un pour la phytothérapie chez les chevaux et l'autre pour les chiens et les chats. Mais ce qu'on peut déjà en dire, c'est décrire \"la philosophie\" et la méthodologie de base de la phytothérapie vétérinaire. Le principe pour élaborer un mélange de plantes se déroule en plusieurs étapes : 1) il faut cerner et bien connaître la maladie que l'on veut traiter chez son animal, en ayant des connaissance sur la cause et la pathogénie 2) il faut établir une liste de symptômes et des signes qu'il faut freiner, bloquer, améliorer ou arranger Exemple : pour un chien de 20 kg souffrant d'une tendinite avec œdème, on peut lister : - l'inflammation à diminuer - l'œdème à éliminer par un diurétique (draineur rénal) - le caractère \"accumulateur\" (l'œdème est un signe de maladie de surcharge) - d'éventuels faiblesses vasculaires qui favorisent la sortie du liquide hors des vaisseaux, faisant apparaître l'œdème - la cause probable : un manque d'élasticité des tendons qui sont normalement bien souples soit dans ce cas : 5 signes à améliorer www.phyto-animaux.com 18 3) choisissez 1 à 2 plantes de chaque catégorie de plantes adéquates proposées comme solution pour les symptômes (NB : ces catégories seront expliquées et bien décrites avec les plantes correspondantes dans les ouvrages en cours) Pour notre exemple : - l'inflammation => à diminuer avec une plante anti-inflammatoire - l'œdème => à éliminer par une plantes diurétique (draineur rénal) - le caractère \"accumulateur\", la surcharge => on peut drainer aussi le foie - d'éventuels faiblesses vasculaires => on va renforcer les vaisseaux avec une plante vasoprotectrice - la cause probable : un manque d'élasticité des tendons => on va utiliser une plante reminéralisante, riche en silice pour rendre les tissus plus élastiques soit dans ce cas : 5 plantes que l'on va récapituler et choisir comme suit : - une plante anti-inflammatoire => l'harpagophytum - une plantes diurétique (draineur rénal) => le pissenlit - une plante drainant le foie => l'artichaut - une plante vasoprotectrice => le cassis - une plante reminéralisante et riche en silice => la prêle Donc 5 plantes disponibles sous forme de poudre sèche 4) Vous calculez les quantités nécessaires : Sachant qu'il s'agit d'un chien de 20 kg, la posologie du mélange doit être de 10 g/jour pendant 10 jours (voir le Chapitre 9 : \"Le dosage\"). Donc il faut préparer un mélange de 100 g (= 10 g x 10 jrs). Comme on a choisi 5 plantes : le mélange de 100 gr est divisé en 5 composants = il faudra 20 g de chaque plante 5) Vous pouvez commander sur le site de Phyto-animaux les plantes de votre choix, dans des quantités minimales 6) Vous mélangez les plantes choisies en quantités adéquates : donc vous pesez 20 g de chaque plante et vous les mélangez de manière homogène 7) Vous donnez à votre chien une dose de votre préparation par jour, soit 10 g à mélanger dans la ration pendant 10 jours 8) Vous pouvez conserver votre phyto-préparation dans un bocal en verre, au frais et à l'abri de l'humidité (conservation : 1 an). Bien sûr, cette méthodologie est relativement simple. Mais c'est une bonne façon d'aborder la phytothérapie, en préparant vous-même un mélange simple mais déjà très efficace pour aider votre compagnon. C'est une bonne solution de base pour des maladies courantes et relativement simples. www.phyto-animaux.com 19 De plus, avec cette façon de penser et de faire, vous pourrez mieux analyser un éventuel traitement à base de plantes. Cela vous permettra d'être plus critique et plus armé pour dénicher les \"arnaques\". Enfin, les mélanges de plantes proposées sur le site de Phyto-animaux sont évidemment bien plus complexes et complets, car ils englobent aussi des nutriments complémentaires adéquats. Ils concernent aussi bien des pathologies \"simples\" (si vous n'avez pas envie de faire vos préparations vous-même) que des maladies beaucoup plus complexes. 11. Les huiles essentielles en aromathérapie : des précautions importantes De par le procédé d'extractions des principes actifs des plantes, les huiles essentielles sont hyperconcentrées en molécules biochimiques (lire le Chapitre 6 : \"Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ?\"). Ces molécules sont très variées, complexes et certaines sont très toxiques (phénols, aldéhydes aromatiques,....), ce qui implique que leur utilisation chez les animaux doit impérativement se faire par des traitements élaborés par un vétérinaire aromathérapeute expérimenté.  Voici les grands principes d'utilisation des HE chez les animaux : 1) n'utiliser les HE que pour un usage externe, de préférence sur une peau intacte 2) ne jamais utiliser les HE pures sur les muqueuses ou sur les plaies ouvertes 3) utiliser les HE sous forme hautement diluée dans un support huileux adéquat : pour un usage cutané, les HE doivent être mélangées dans un support gras (huile végétale comme l'huile d'olive, l'huile de noisette,...) et diluées à hauteur de maximum 10 % pour les HE les moins agressives (lavande vraie, tea tree,...) 4) ne pas utiliser les HE de manière prolongée (quelques jours de traitement suffisent) 5) éviter l'usage des HE dermocaustiques ou toxiques (comme celles contenants des phénols, des cétones, des aldéhydes aromatiques,...) : si vraiment leur usage est indispensable (bactéries résistantes aux traitements classiques, plaies très infectées,..), elles sont à diluer à une concentration de 1 à 2 % maximum dans un support gras adéquat. (On peut travailler avec des concentrations plus hautes, mais uniquement avec des préparations élaborées par un vétérinaire expérimenté et spécialisé en aromathérapie et avec un suivi médical rigoureux). 6) PAS d'HE chez les chats ! Préférer la solution alternative que sont les hydrolats : Même si quelques rares HE peuvent être utilisées chez lui, il vaut mieux être radical pour ne prendre aucun risque. En effet, la plupart des HE sont trop toxiques pour lui, notamment à cause des voies de métabolisation limitées chez lui (lire le Chapitre 7 : \"Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie\" au point d : Métabolisation) www.phyto-animaux.com 20 Et même si les HE ne sont pas toxiques (HE de lavande vraie), elles le perturbent fortement au point de le faire baver immédiatement et intensément ; ce n'est pas vraiment grave mais c'est terriblement impressionnant et cela effraie le propriétaire (qui croit souvent que son animal fait une crise d'épilepsie !). 7) PAS d'HE non plus chez les animaux jeunes, vieux, malades, en convalescence, gestants ou en lactation 8) avec les HE, dans le doute : on s'abstient ! 9) certaines HE peuvent être utilisée en aérolosothérapie (= inhalation = nébulisation), mais le plus souvent, il s'agit d'un traitement nécessitant un suivi vétérinaire (infection respiratoire, coryza sévère,...) 10) éviter d'utiliser des HE d'ambiance ou pour parfumer votre maison ou votre linge : les animaux, avec leur odorat performant, peuvent être fortement perturbés par ces molécules olfactives trop fortes pour leur narines délicates. Il s'agit d'une sorte de pollution olfactive (malheureusement de plus en plus fréquente), entraînant parfois des troubles de comportement ; surtout chez les chats (malpropreté, griffades, animal qui ne rentre plus dans la maison,...).  Un commentaire concernant l'utilisation éventuelle des HE contre les parasites externes (tiques, puces, mouches,...) : Dans le commerce, on trouve de plus en plus d'antiparasitaires externes à base d'HE ou d'autres substances naturelles. Malheureusement, ces produits ne conviennent pas pour diverses raisons : - soit les molécules naturelles sont associées à des molécules chimiques, rendant le produit toxique Exemple : rajout de perméthrine, toxique pour le chat (lire le paragraphe concernant le pyrèthre et ses dérivés, dans l'article \"Vermifuge pour chat : naturel ou chimique ?\") - soit le produit est vraiment naturel, mais les HE utilisées sont toxiques ou trop dosées, ce qui peut être source d'intoxication pour l'animal - soit le produit est naturel et ne contient que des molécules sûres, mais alors on aura un problème d'efficacité : ce produit n'aura pas beaucoup de résultats, ou alors il aura un effet qui ne durera pas dans le temps (problème de rémanence, c'est le cas des solutions naturelles anti-mouches pour le cheval). Certains vieux remèdes de grand-mère sont +/- efficaces mais limités à un usage pour les chiens uniquement : - placer des fougères fraîches ou sèches sous le panier du chien pour limiter les puces - mettre des sachets de lavande (en plantes sèches, pas en HE car pollution olfactive) - frotter votre chien avec du vinaigre pour éliminer les puces Ces \"trucs\" limiteront les parasites mais ne les élimineront pas tout à fait. Le recours aux produits chimiques dans la lutte contre les parasites est donc quasiment incontournable, mais le meilleur conseil est de ne les utiliser que si votre animal est TRES parasité. www.phyto-animaux.com 21 Il vaut mieux utiliser ces produits chimiques si la nécessité s'en fait sentir, quand votre animal est très dérangé, qu'il se gratte beaucoup ou s'il souffre d'allergie de type DAPP (dermatite allergique aux piqûres de puces), et non systématiquement chaque mois comme les fabricants le conseillent. En effet, par cet usage mensuel excessif et systématique, vous faites marcher la roue purement commerciale, vous intoxiquez inutilement votre animal et vous favorisez l'apparition de parasites résistants. Donc comme pour tout : faites-en un usage parcimonieux, réfléchi et uniquement si l'état de santé de votre animal le nécessite, ou que la présence de parasites est vraiment trop importante. 12. Conclusion : Pour résumer, les plantes chez les animaux sont une EXCELLENTE solution pour bon nombre de maladies, à usage préventif ou curatif, mais à condition de connaître les pathologies à traiter, ainsi que les formes des plantes utilisables, avec leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients, leur efficacité et leur toxicité éventuelle. Vous avec ainsi le choix : soit vous préparez le remède pour votre animal vous-même, après vous être bien renseigné auprès de sources sûres et sérieuses sur tous les paramètres (maladie, plantes, toxicité,...), soit vous choisissez de le traiter avec des phyto-préparations élaborées par des professionnels, vétérinaires, phytothérapeutes et expérimentés. Cela vous garantira l'efficacité du remède et la sécurité pour votre animal.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Tout comme pour nous humains, les dangers de la vie moderne tels que la pollution, la mauvaise alimentation, le stress et un mode de vie malsain, peuvent conduire à une variété de maladies chez nos animaux domestiques. Les médecines à base de plantes sont particulièrement utiles pour les conditions associées au système gastro-intestinal. Il n’existe qu’une poignée de recherche, mais une pléthore de témoignages, concernant le chardon-Marie en tant que traitement efficace et sans danger pour les animaux souffrant de tous types de problèmes hépatiques. Le chardon-Marie (Silybum marianum) est une plante à fleurs de la famille des Astéracées. Originaire des régions méditerranéennes de l'Europe, de l'Afrique du Nord et du Moyen-Orient, il est utilisé en médecine depuis plus de 2000 ans. C’est l'une des rares plantes largement acceptée par la science conventionnelle. Son ingrédient actif est la silymarine qui se compose de 3 flavonoïdes : la silychristine, la silydianine et la silybine. UTILISATIONS Le chardon-Marie est à présent préconisé pour une utilisation chez de nombreux types d’animaux comme les chiens, les chats, et les furets, mais aussi les chevaux, les chèvres et les rongeurs (attention il peut être toxique chez les moutons et les vaches). De nombreux vétérinaires holistiques le recommandent pour les problèmes suivants: - Stéatose hépatique - Hépatite chronique - Lipidose hépatique (chez le chat) - Hépatomégalie FOIE - Cholangite (inflammation des voies biliaires) - Péricholangite (inflammation du tissu autour des canaux biliaires) - Prévention des calculs biliaires - Récupération après une maladie qui touche le foie, comme le parvovirus et la leptospirose - Intoxication due aux insecticides, aux pesticides, aux champignons vénéneux, à la vaccination et à certains traitements médicamenteux - Association à des traitements dans les infections dues à des protozoaires - Allergies - Diabète AUTRES AFFECTIONS - Maladies inflammatoires de l’intestin (MII) - Support du système immunitaire - Cancer Les maladies du foie sont plus fréquentes qu’on ne pense chez les animaux de compagnie. Certaines races de chiens ont aussi une prédisposition génétique aux maladies du foie, comme la toxicose au cuivre chez les Terriers de Bedlington, les labradors retrievers, les dalmatiens, les Dobermans Pinschers et les dogues allemands. Beaucoup de maladies ont aussi une incidence sur le foie, que cela soit le problème d’origine ou un effet secondaire. Les fonctions du foie vont aider le métabolisme et la digestion au stockage de l'énergie, à la fabrication du sang et à la production des enzymes nécessaires pour une variété de fonctions au maintien de la vie, à stimuler la croissance de nouvelles cellules hépatiques pour remplacer celles mortes ou endommagées. Les bactéries et les virus, les traitements médicamenteux, les toxines, les radicaux libres (les produits chimiques dans notre corps) et l'inflammation sont tous responsables de dommages sur le foie. L'exposition à des toxines environnementales peut augmenter les radicaux libres dans le corps, ce qui peut endommager nos cellules. Ceci est appelé oxydation et peut éventuellement conduire au cancer, aux maladies cardiaques, à l’arthrose, etc. Le chardon-Marie est un antioxydant puissant et la recherche montre qu’il protège le foie contre l'oxydation en empêchant les radicaux libres, et contribue également à le réparer. Lorsque votre animal reçoit un traitement préventif contre les vers de cœur, les tiques ou les puces, il reçoit des produits chimiques qui sont difficiles à gérer pour son foie. Le chardon-Marie doit être considéré comme une aide à la guérison après un traitement médicamenteux, une vaccination, et une infection telle que le parvovirus canin ou la leptospirose, ainsi que les traitements contre le cancer. Rodney Habib, nutritionniste canin de renommée mondiale, indique que «La désintoxication est un processus aussi important non seulement pour nous les humains, mais aussi pour nos animaux de compagnie. Nous pouvons donner à nos poilus bien-aimés les meilleurs aliments du monde, si les pores sont obstrués par des toxines, cela ne permettra pas aux éléments nutritifs essentiels d’être assimilés, provoquant un affaiblissement du système immunitaire. L’affaiblissement du système immunitaire d'un animal est la cause d’une multitude de problèmes ! ». Historiquement, le chardon-Marie a été utilisé avec succès comme un antidote d'urgence contre l'empoisonnement aux champignons, si donné dans les 24 heures, car il réduit considérablement les dommages au foie qui peuvent être mortels. Un bon fonctionnement du foie contribue aussi à combattre les allergies. D’après Mark. E. Richardson, médecin et auteur : « Le foie doit traiter les toxines et quand il ne peut pas faire son travail, il les stocke. S’il les stocke il produit aussi des histamines supplémentaires pour se protéger. Si un allergène est présent, le cerveau envoie un message : \"Envoyez quelques histamines! Je crois qu'il y a un envahisseur !! \" Le foie en produit et en libère trop, et vous avez la réponse allergique ». (http://ezinearticles.com/?The-True-Cause-Of-Allergies---Its-In-The-Liver&id=439043). De nombreux chiens souffrant de maladie intestinale inflammatoire (IBD) ont une inflammation simultanée du système hépatique / biliaire et du pancréas. Parce que les actions bénéfiques du chardon se concentrent sur ​​les systèmes du foie et des voies biliaires, il peut également être utile chez les chiens souffrant de ce type de pathologie. Une étude de l'Université Case Western Reserve en Ohio conclut que « la silymarine possède des effets protecteurs exceptionnellement élevés contre la croissance de la tumeur ». D’autres études en laboratoire suggèrent également que les extraits du chardon-Marie peuvent avoir des effets anti-cancer. En particulier, ces études ont montré qu'il peut ralentir la croissance de certaines cellules cancéreuses, qu'il peut potentialiser ou améliorer l'activité de certains médicaments de chimiothérapie, et qu'il peut protéger en empêchant les cellules de se diviser, en raccourcissant leur durée de vie et / ou en réduisant l'apport sanguin vers les cellules cancéreuses. La recherche se poursuit en ce qui concerne le rôle de la silymarine dans le traitement du cancer, en particulier si elle doit être évitée dans le traitement du cancer du foie (car s’il favorise la régénération du foie, il pourrait éventuellement stimuler la croissance de certains types de cancer du foie). Donc à suivre sur ce dernier point. Une étude humaine suggère même son rôle contre le diabète grâce à ses effets de normalisation sur les globules rouges. Il peut aussi aider à prévenir la neuropathie diabétique, une complication fréquente de la maladie qui provoque une dégénérescence des nerfs contrôlant les membres postérieurs, et qui produit par conséquent une faiblesse et une démarche anormale. D'autres recherches suggèrent que le chardon-Marie favorise la fonction rénale chez les patients ayant des lésions rénales dues au diabète. Le chardon-Marie soutient généralement le système immunitaire grâce à ses puissants antioxydants, l'action anti radicalaire, sa capacité à préserver l'approvisionnement d'un autre antioxydant important, le glutathion, ainsi que des effets directs sur les cellules immunitaires. Le glutathion, qui est stocké principalement dans le foie, diminue naturellement avec le temps, et l'épuisement de cette protéine semble accélérer le processus de vieillissement. EFFETS SECONDAIRES PRECAUTIONS D’EMPLOI Avant d'ajouter cette plante miracle au régime quotidien de votre chien juste au cas où il pourrait faire du bien, il est important de réserver ce traitement à une maladie existante, ou comme un moyen de nettoyage du foie après une exposition à des toxines, mais pas à titre préventif. Bien que l'utilisation modérée du chardon-Marie soit très sûre, l'ingestion de doses très élevées à long terme finira par supprimer la fonction du foie. Donc, comme pour tout supplément, user mais ne pas abuser. Chez les animaux, quelques effets secondaires mineurs peuvent occasionnellement survenir pendant un traitement au chardon-Marie, même en suivant les directives de dosage. Certains chiens peuvent avoir des selles molles ou des gaz, le problème est facilement résolu en diminuant la dose ou en arrêtant le traitement. Concernant une utilisation chez les femelles gestantes et allaitantes, les informations à ce sujet sont contradictoires. Le chardon-Marie pourrait aussi interférer avec le métabolisme d'un certain nombre de médicaments et stimuler les effets des hormones telles que les œstrogènes, et donc réduire les effets des contraceptifs chez les humains (cette dernière information ne concerne pas vraiment nos animaux de compagnie, mais il vaut mieux trop d’information que pas assez). Le livre “The Complete Holistic Dog” de Jan Allegretti et Katy recommande le chardon-Marie pour les chiens épileptiques lorsqu’ils sont sous phénobarbital pour contrôler les crises, car il peut aider à protéger le foie contre les dommages résultant de ce traitement hépatotoxique. Le chardon-Marie augmentant l’efficacité de certaines drogues, là encore, consultez votre vétérinaire naturopathe pour voir si la dose de phénobarbital peut/doit être réduite lors de la prise de chardon-Marie. De toute évidence, si votre animal est sous traitement, il est préférable de consultez un professionnel, avant de lui administrer ce supplément en conjonction avec un traitement médicamenteux. En Allemagne où le chardon-Marie est approuvé par le gouvernement, il est considéré comme tellement sûr qu'il n'y aucune mise en garde contre son utilisation, même pendant la grossesse et l'allaitement. Les rapports d’effets secondaires indésirables ou d’interactions sont rares. Les recherches à ce sujet étant encore peu concluantes, et certains éléments trouvés contradictoires, suivez mon moto : « Dans le doute, abstiens-toi ». Enfin, certains medicaments etant modifiés, affectés, ou partiellement decomposés par le foie, leur assimilation pourrait etre ralentie par l'utilisation du chardon-Marie, ou cela pourrait aussi augmenter leurs effets secondaires il faut donc mieux éviter de les donner en meme temps. Parmis ces medicaents on compte notamment ceux qui continennet de l'amitriptyline, du diazepam (Valium), du zileuton, du celecoxib, du diclofenac (Voltaren), du fluvastatin (Lescol), di glipizide), de l'ibuprofen (Advil), de l' irbesartan, de l'losartan, du phenytoin (Dilantin), du piroxicam,, du tamoxifen, dutolbutamide, du torsemide (Demadex), de la warfarine (Coumadin), etc. DOSAGE Avant tout chose, il convient de préciser au lecteur que le dosage dont nous parlons ici est en silymarine, le composant actif du chardon-Marie. Les extraits de chardon-Marie disponibles aujourd'hui contiennent des % de silymarine différents, regardez donc bien l'etiquette avant d'acheter et calculez la dose requise pour votre animal en fonction de cela. On peut l’acheter sous forme de poudre, de capsules et d'extrait liquide (teinture mère). Prenez aussi en compte la taille de votre animal, et le dosage dont il aura besoin. En cas de doute sur une marque, venez nous poser la question sur Facebook. Chez les humains des études ont montré que le chardon-Marie était plus efficace lorsqu’administré en plusieurs fois au cours de la journée, plutôt qu’en une large dose quotidienne. Lorsqu’il n’est pas possible de diviser la dose quotidienne en 3 ou 4 fois, il faut la répartir en au moins 2 fois par jour. Pour une détox après l’administration d’un antiparasite chimique (interne ou externe) : 1 semaine après le traitement, une cure de 3 semaines. Après un long traitement/dur traitement médicamenteux : donner en plusieurs cures de 3 à 6 semaines, et faire des pauses de 1 à 3 semaines entre chaque. Prenez une marque de qualité, qui contient 70 a 80% de sylimarine, et qui NE CONTIENT PAS DE XYLITOL (parfois appelé sucre de bouleau) .Le dosage est de 5mg à 10mg par kg de poids vif, selon que c'est pour une détox ou un problème avéré comme un taux d’enzymes hépatiques légèrement élevé. Dans certaines pathologies sérieuses ou graves, vous pouvez même aller jusqu’à 50mg par kg de poids vif, mais sous la supervision d’un vétérinaire naturopathe ; J’insiste sur ce dernier point. 1- CALCUL PAR RAPPORT À LA POSOLOGIE POUR HUMAINS Trop compliqué ? Je vous comprends. D’un pays à l’autre, le conditionnement est différent et les étiquettes ne sont pas toujours faciles à comprendre. Vous pouvez donc opter de calculer le dosage pour votre animal, par rapport à la posologie pour humains, mais sachez que ce dosage aura tendance à être un peu moins précis et en-dessous de celui-calculé par rapport au % de silymarine ci-dessus. Si la posologie recommandée sur la notice indique un nombre différent de comprimés/gélules par jour, selon la pathologie à traiter, servez-vous du tableau ci-dessus pour déterminer si votre animal requiert la dose minimum ou une plus élevé. Par exemple : la notice indique « pour un adulte, 1 à 3 comprimés par jour » : Si vous voulez juste faire une détox après un traitement antiparasitaire chimique, prenez 1 comprimé/jour comme base. Si votre animal de compagnie a un taux d’enzymes légèrement élevé, prenez 2 comprimés/jour comme base. Si votre animal a un taux d’enzymes assez élevé, prenez 3 comprimés/jour comme base Mais si comme pour la marque que j’utilise, il n’y a qu’une posologie de 1 comprimé/jour, le tâche va s’avérer difficile, d’où l’importance de bien calculer votre coup avant d’acheter. LE TABLEAU CI-DESSOUS EST POUR LES NOVICES, C'EST ON NE PEUT PLUS SIMPLE! Regardez l'étiquette du produit que vous avez selectionné, combien de comprimes ou gelules par jours ils recommandent pour un humain, et faites le calcul. N'oubliez pas que pour une meilleure efficacité, vous voudrez repartir la dose en 2 ou 3 prises par jour. 2- SOUS FORME D'EPS (EN PHARMACIE) 1ml/5kg de poids corporel, ne pas depasser 5ml meme pour un gros chien. Nous vous conseillons la marque PhytoPrevent des laboratoires Pileje, que vous pouvez faire preparer sur certains sites en ligne dont Soin Et Nature, ou en pharmacie-conseil PhytoPrevent. Pour trouver leurs points de vente pres de chez vous, rendez-vous sur leur site : https://www.pileje.fr/nous-trouver/pharmacies, et tappez votre code postal.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Ce matin, lors de notre randonnée matinale j’ai cueilli quelques cenelles, et je voulais partager leurs bienfaits avec vous. Pour la petite histoire, c’est notre chienne Yulia qui me les a fait découvrir. Nous avons recueilli Yulia lorsqu’elle n’avait qu’une dizaine de semaines et avait été abandonnée dans la campagne, livrée à elle-même pendant quelques jours. Elle a survécu en se nourrissant de tout ce qu’elle trouvait, baies sauvages comprises. C’est comme cela qu’un jour en promenade, je l’ai vue manger des baies rouges que je suis empressée de lui faire cracher au cas où elles seraient toxiques. De retour à la maison, je m’étais renseignée et découvert qu’il s’agissait de cenelles, non seulement un fruit comestible, mais plein de bienfaits pour nos chiens. Elle semble connaître celles qui sont comestibles et celles qui ne le sont pas. La cenelle est le fruit de l'aubépine, un excellent cardiotonique. Sa capacité à faire lentement baisser la tension artérielle est documentée, bien que le mécanisme de son action soit incertain. L’aubépine ne bloque pas les canaux calciques et n’agit pas non plus comme diurétique. En fait c’est un excellent moyen de réduire la tension artérielle même pour les animaux diabétiques ou ceux qui ont des problèmes de reins. Les feuilles, les bourgeons, les fleurs et les baies d’aubépine améliorent la fonction générale du cœur, stabilisent et renforcent un rythme cardiaque faible ou irrégulier. L’aubépine est si performante que des études démontrent qu’elle est tout aussi efficace que la digitaline, sans ses effets nocifs. Il n'y a pas de danger d'effets secondaires ou danger cumulatif et elle peut aider à réduire la dose de digitaline de moitié. L’aubépine est riche en flavonoïdes et en antioxydants qui sont bons pour le cœur et les vaisseaux sanguins à bien des égards, leurs effets anti-inflammatoires puissants relaxant les vaisseaux sanguins. Leur action anti- microbienne stoppe les infections comme celles des gencives, qui peuvent nuire au cœur. Ses flavonoïdes – le pigment rouge des baies d'aubépine – sont le composant le plus responsable de son effet tonique, et qui soutiennent le bon fonctionnement du système immunitaire et du foie. La cenelle est le fruit qui contient la plus grande source naturelle de flavonoïdes. Enfin, elle contient aussi beaucoup de vitamine C. Elle est bénéfique pour les chiens âgés, ceux souffrant d'insuffisance cardiaque, ceux qui ont des anomalies cardiaques à la suite d’un traitement contre les vers de cœur, une infection ou un traitement de chimiothérapie, mais aussi pour les chiens de travail.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Aujourd'hui je vais vous parler de trois plantes aux vertus répulsives que j'ai découvertes au cours des derniers mois, et que vous pouvez utiliser sur vos chiens et chats. PREMIER VOLET : LE CISTE (CISTUS INCANUS/CRETICUS) Le ciste (ou cyste) est une plante aromatique, médicinale et apicole de grande valeur, qui pousse dans de nombreuses régions du bassin méditerranéen. Il appartient à la famille des cistacées qui comprend une cinquantaine d'espèces reconnues, mais celle qui nous intéresse tout particulièrement est Cistus Incanus/Villosus/Creticus, originaire de Grece. Ses feuilles ont une très haute teneur en polyphénols (5), une capacité étonnante à détruire les radicaux libres, et une activité antioxydante élevée. Il existe d'autres type de ciste, dont le ciste ladanifère, originaire d'Espagne, mais qui est beaucoup moins intéressant car il contient bien moindre concentration de composants actifs (19). Toutes les parties aériennes de la plante sont couvertes de poils glandulaires solitaires qui, pendant la saison chaude, libèrent une sécrétion résineuse du nom de labdanum pour se protéger contre la déshydratation et les UV. Cette oléorésine est recherchée depuis la nuit des temps, elle est particulièrement aromatique, et est utilisée dans la fabrication d’encens et de parfums. Elle contient des diterpènes lithiques et une étonnante concentration de polyphénols, notamment des proanthocyanidines, des bioflavonoïdes, des catéchines, de l’acide gallique, et des rutines, possédant tous des propriétés pharmacologiques intéressantes. Ce phénomene ne se produit qu'en Crete a cause du climat, donc meme si comme moi vous trouvez du cistus créticus dans votre région (et je vis en Grece, mais dans le nord), il ne sera pas d'assez bonne qualité pour ces préparations. Le ciste compte un large spectre de vertus thérapeutiques comme : Une activité antimicrobienne et cytostatique (qui bloque la prolifération cellulaire et empêche la formation de tumeurs (en particulier les sarcomes), ce sont les mêmes propriétés que la chimiothérapie). Ralentit le vieillissement cellulaire, Antihémorragique, Grâce a ses polyphénols qui inhibent la libération d'histamine, il possède des propriétés antiallergiques, Apaisante du tube digestif, soulage l’inflammation du tractus gastro-intestinal, améliore la flore intestinale, Détoxifie des métaux lourds (cadmium), et notamment de la contamination environnementale ; soutient le foie et le pancréas. Module le système immunitaire (18), Anti-infectieux, antiviral et antifongique(6), il inhibe notamment la croissance de certains micro-organismes comme les bactéries coliformes (E. Coli), les Candida albican, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, et Aspergillus fumigatus ; des études ont d’ailleurs démontré qu'il était efficace contre certains rétrovirus comme la grippe, le Sida et la maladie de Lyme (1, 2, 3 ) Astringent, antispasmodique, expectorant, analgésique, réduit les symptômes de la bronchite. Utile à titre prophylactique pour prévenir les rhumes et autres maladies (8), Tonique, il augmente l'énergie et la vitalité, Il est anti-inflammatoire et traite une multitude de maladies chroniques et auto-immunes, dont les problèmes articulaires, Cicatrisant, il traite certaines maladies de la peau comme l’eczéma et les démangeaisons, soulage les irritations cutanées, etc (7). Favorise la santé bucco-dentaire en décomposant le biofilm dentaire (plaque dentaire), Augmente la barrière protectrice naturelle contre les parasites externes. C’est ce dernier point qui nous intéresse tout particulièrement. En effet, je suis tombée par hasard sur l’utilisation du ciste comme répulsif contre les tiques et les moustiques (et peut-être aussi contre les puces) lors d’une rencontre avec un berger alors que nous promenions nos chiens dans la garrigue. En discutant avec lui, je mentionnais que nous aimerions bien avoir un ou 2 moutons dans notre cour pour manger l’herbe, mais que je craignais qu’ils attrapent des tiques et deviennent un réservoir potentiel. C’est là qu’il m’a parlé de la résine de ciste et m’a expliqué que lorsque les chèvres et les moutons pâturent dans la garrigue et passent entre les plants de ciste pendant la saison chaude, ils accumulent alors sur leur pelage des gouttelettes de sève et les tiques leur fichent la paix. J’ai donc creusé le sujet et trouvé quelques informations sur les vertus répulsives du ciste, ainsi que plusieurs allusions à une étude mais je n’ai pas encore réussi à la trouver. D’après ces informations, on peut utiliser le ciste en interne comme en externe. Je pense que c’est une forte probabilité, car le ciste a fait l’objet d’études pour traiter la maladie de Lyme, ainsi que pour son utilisation en prophylaxie En général j’ai pu observer que les plantes qui traitent les maladies des tiques ont tendance à fonctionner aussi comme répulsif. En Corse, certains oiseaux en mettent dans leurs nids comme protection contre les parasites. RECETTES INFUSION : Il faut 2 cuillers à café de ciste pour 250ml d’eau, et laisser infuser a couvert pour conserver les phénols volatiles pendant au moins 10-15mn. Filtrer, faire sécher le ciste qui peut être réutilisé une seconde fois, si on a un produit de qualité. Dosage et fréquence pour chiens et chats (*) : 1 cuiller à soupe d’infusion par tranche de 5kg par jour. Il faut compter 5 à 7 jours avant de constater les premiers effets, et 10 à 12 jours pour atteindre l’efficacité maximum. Aucun effet secondaire connu, mais observer une petite fenêtre thérapeutique est toujours utile, donner 4 jours sur 5 ou 6, après les 3 premières semaines de cure. SOUS FORME DE PLANTE SÉCHÉE : ¼ Cac par tranche de 10kg de poids corporel, par jour Donner 4 jours sur 5 ou 6 après 2 semaines de prise journaliere. Incidemment, je vous conseille d’acheter votre ciste sous forme de feuilles et fleurs entières, certains vendeurs parlant parfois de sommités fleuries. Comme pour tous les types d’infusion, la version poudre ou feuilles cassées est de qualité inférieure, elle a perdu pas mal de son parfum, de ses terpènes et polyphénols. J’ai eu l’occasion d’acheter les 2 versions chez le même vendeur, les sommités coutaient 1.00€ de plus pour 100g et ça les vaut largement. Si la description du vendeur ne le précise pas, posez-lui la question. Évitez les produits destinés à la consommation animale, ils sont peut-être moins chers mais c’est le fond du tonneau, les résidus, et ils n’auront pas la même efficacité. Ci-dessous les deux produits proposés par mon vendeur, la différence est pour le moins évidente. Et si vous avez un produit de qualité, vous paierez peut-etre un peu plus cher, mais vous pourrez faire 2 ou 3 infusions avec chaque dose, alors qu'avec un produit de mauvaise qualité, vous ne pourrez en faire qu'une et elle contiendra peu de polyphénols. (*) Ca marche aussi sur les chats si vous arrivez a leur faire prendre EN SPRAY SUR LE PELAGE : Suivre la même procédure que pour l’infusion mais doubler la quantité de ciste, et appliquer sur le pelage. Durée d’efficacité : environ 8 heures. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'hydrolat de ciste, mais c'est beaucoup plus couteux et nous ne savons pas si le contenu en polyphénols est le meme. MACERAT HUILEUX DE LABDANUM : Comme mentionné plus haut, le labdanum (ou ladanum) est le nom donné a la résine de ciste. Ses vertus sont beaucoup plus concentrées que la plante en elle-même, et le prix aussi. Tout dépend des utilisations que l’on veut en faire et de la quantité d’animaux à traiter. 10g de labdanum 30 a 100g d’huile végétale (olive, jujube ou noix de coco fractionnée) Porter de l'eau à ébullition dans une casserole puis mettre le Labdanum et l'huile dans un bocal, et mettre le bocal dans la casserole d'eau chaude. Baisser le feu de façon a ce que l'eau frémisse a peine. Laisser infuser et remuer régulierement jusqu'à ce que le Labdanum soit complètement dissout, ou lorsque vous pensez qu'il ne se décomposera plus ; cela prendra plus ou moins longtemps selon que votre labdanum est réduit en poudre ou est en morceaux. Retirer le bocal de la casserole. On peut laisser le macérat huileux tel quel reposer pendant 4 à 6 semaines pour en extraire le plus de composants possibles avant de le filtrer, ou bien attendre qu’il refroidisse et le filtrer immédiatement et conserver le labdanum non dissout pour une future préparation. Cette huile magnifiquement aromatique peut être utilisée avec d'autres huiles nourrissantes pour le pelage ou la peau ou avec un peu de lanoline ou de cire d'abeille . Selon l'huile que vous avez utilisée, ce produit se conservera de 2 ans (huile d'olive) à indéfiniment (jujube, huile de noix de coco fractionnée). Vous pouvez utiliser cette huile parfumée comme base pour des préparations comme notre baume à la propolis, l’utiliser telle quelle sur toutes sortes de lésions comme des blessures – même sérieuses puisque la ciste aide a ralentir les saignements, des infections à levures, des otites, etc. Enfin, quelques gouttes sur vos mains, en friction sur le pelage comme répulsifs anti-tiques, puces et moustiques. TEINTURE MÈRE DE LABDANUM 2g de labdanum 35ml d’alcool a au moins 45 ou 50°, style alcool de fruits (grappa, eau de vie de poire ou de pomme) ou vodka (*). Comme pour faire une teinture de propolis qui est d'une consistance semblable, on peut congeler le morceau de labdanum quelques heures pour le durcir ; il sera plus facile a casser en petits morceaux, ou mieux encore, le réduire en poudre dans un moulin à épices ou à café. Mélanger le tout dans un bocal en verre, visser le couvercle et secouer. Conserver dans un endroit sombre et secouer deux à trois fois par jour pendant deux semaines. Au bout de ce temps filtrer et conserver dans un flacon ambré à l’abri de la lumière. Si tout le labdanum n’est pas dissout, conservez-le pour une prochaine préparation. Et l’huile essentielle de ciste ladanifère? Je vous la déconseille. C’est très concentré en terpènes, et comme pour d’autres huiles essentielles, l’imposer à votre animal de compagnie peut avoir des effets indésirables insoupçonnés. Chez moi les huiles essentielles sont le dernier recours. (*) si vous vous utiliser un alcool de moins de 45 ou 50°, laissez macerer plus longtemps). TEINTURE MÈRE D'ABSOLUE DE LABDANUM Le labdanum étant quasiment impossible a trouver dans les pays francophone européens, vous pouvez tenter l'expérience avec de l'absolue de labdanum, plus facile a trouver. L'absolue est extraite a partir d'alcool qui est ensuite évaporée pour obtenir une sorte de pate, mais elle n'est soluble qu'avec de l'alcool, vous pouvez donc vous en servir pour faire une teinture mere en suivant la recette ci-dessus, et diluer a 90% avant d'appliquer sur le pelage. REPULSIF POUR MOUSTIQUES Vous pouvez aussi bruler un petit morceau de labdanum dans votre maison ou sur votre balcon/terrace, pour éloigner les moustiques. Il vous faudra cependant du brûle-encens, mais a que pour l'extérieur, car c'est du charbon et le respirer n'est sain ni pour vous, ni pour vos animaux de compagnie. N'UTILISEZ SURTOUT PAS D'HUILE ESSENTELLE DE CISTE, C'EST TROP FORT ET ON NE CONNAIT PAS LES EFFETS SUR LES ANIMAUX! DEUXIÈME VOLET : LE GATILLIER L’une de mes autres découvertes l’été dernier est le gattilier, aussi appelé arbre au poivre ou poivre de moine. Il pousse à foison près de chez nous, et je voulais cueillir des graines pour faire une teinture mère. En recherchant ses propriétés médicinales, je suis tombée sur deux études et j’ai décidé de le mettre a l’essai. Le gattilier est connu pour ses propriétés de régulateur hormonal. La Grèce comptant de nombreux monastères, ils en sont grands consommateurs, car le gattilier calmerait, parait-il, les ardeurs sexuelles, d’où ses surnoms de « poivre des moines » et « d’agneau chaste ». De la famille des verbénacées, toutes les parties aériennes peuvent être utilisées mais ce sont les graines qui contiennent la plus grande concentration d’antioxydants. De nos jours il est utilisé comme Régulateur du cycle hormonal, favorise la fertilité et aiderait à prévenir les fausses couches et traiter l’infertilité (15) Galactagogue Stimulant des récepteurs de la dopamine dans le cerveau, il est parfois utilisé pour traiter les maladies neurodégénératives et la dépression Pour traiter l'hyperplasie bénigne de la prostate Améliorer la consolidation des fractures (10) Anti inflammatoire et analgésique (11) Modulateur endocrinien, et notamment utilisé pour traiter la maladie de Cushing chez le chien et le cheval (12) Anti-oxydant et anticancéreux (carcinome pulmonaire, carcinome mammaire (13), cancer de la prostate) (14) Traite les flatulences Réduit l'appétit Répulsif contre les tiques, les puces, les moustiques et les mouches piqueuses (16) Tue les larves de poux et des puces et entrave la reproduction des adultes (17-18) Tout comme pour la ciste, cet article n’a pour but que de discuter les vertus antiparasitaires du gattilier, car son usage en interne doit faire l’objet de quelques précautions, il y a quelques interactions médicamenteuses et des effets secondaires potentiels, il vaut donc mieux l’utiliser sous contrôle de votre vétérinaire naturopathe. En revanche son utilisation par voie externe est sans problème, car même si votre animal de compagnie se léchait, il ne pourrait en ingérer suffisamment pour avoir un quelconque effet, mis à part une allergie bien entendu, comme avec tout. Le gattilier est un répulsif efficace contre les puces, les tiques, les mouches piquantes et les moustiques et a fait l’objet d’au moins 2 études sur ce sujet. Il est aussi larvicide et agit sur plusieurs espèces de larves hématophages, et peut aussi inhiber le développement des adultes, vraisemblablement à cause de son action sur le système endocrinien. [1] Selon la concentration, la qualité du produit et la voracité des petites bêtes, l’efficacité est de 3 à 8 heures. Je vous suggère donc de l’utiliser avant les balades dans des zones infestées de tiques ou de moustiques, ou le soir en été si vous vivez dans le pourtour méditerranéen, pour éloigner les moustiques et les phlébotomes porteurs de maladies comme les vers de cœur et la leishmaniose. On peut le réappliquer aussi souvent qu’on veut, il n’y a aucune toxicité, par contre l’odeur est assez désagréable. J’ai donc élaboré la recette qui suit. REPULSIF ANTIPUCES, TIQUES ET MOUSTIQUES AU GATTILIER 1/4 de teinture mère 3/4 d’eau ou de vinaigre de cidre, ou moitié moitié Le répulsif à l’eau devrait etre utilisé immédiatement, celui au vinaigre de cidre dure plusieurs semaines. Vous pouvez aussi réaliser votre propre teinture mère en mettant 100g de parties aériennes séchées (graines, feuilles, tiges) dans un bocal en verre, et 1/2 litre de vodka ou d'alcool a 45 ou 50 degrés. Réduisez-les en poudre pour en extraire le plus de composants possible. Laisser macérer pendant deux à trois semaines et agiter au moins une fois par jour. Au bout de ce temps, filtrer les solides à l'aide d'une étamine ou d'un filtre à café. Certains chiens n’aimant pas les sprays, vous pouvez en mettre sur vos mains et frictionner le pelage de votre chien ou chat avec, ou encore remplacer l’eau/vinaigre par une huile végétale et en faire un baume. Je n’ai pas eu l’opportunité de l’essayer sur les puces puisque mes chiens n’en n’avaient pas, mais je confirme l’efficacité sur les tiques. En octobre, j’ai emmené Yulia, qui est un véritable aimant à tiques, pour une ballade en forêt. Alors que d’ordinaire sans protection, on lui en trouvait plusieurs accrochées et une douzaine qui cherchaient un endroit pour monter leur tente, je n’en ai trouvé qu’une seule sur la patte et qui semblait chercher la sortie. A l’approche du printemps, j’essaierai d’autres recettes avec le gattilier, et je ne manquerai pas de les ajouter a cet article. PANNEAU CENTRAL : LE QUASSIA AMARA Le quassia amara, ou amargo, est un petit arbre ou buisson tropical et subtropical de la famille des Simaroubaceae, pouvant atteindre jusqu’à 5 mètres. Son bois est utilisé pour ses vertus médicinales et les extraits d'écorce comme arôme dans l’industrie alimentaire. Il existe plusieurs types de quassia, celui-ci étant le plus connu, mais ils ont tous relativement les mêmes vertus. Parmi ses utilisations, on trouve notamment : Au niveau de l’appareil digestif, il est connu pour restaurer l'appétit, traiter l’anorexie, stimuler la digestion, traiter la diarrhée comme la constipation et la dysenterie. Sur le plan hépatique on l’utilise pour la cirrhose du foie et l’alcoolisme Fébrifuge, il traite diverses conditions telles que la rougeole, la variole et le paludisme. L’un de ses composants : la quassine, fait l’objets d’études pour traiter la leishmaniose Il est aussi utile en cas de, maladie des voies urinaires, de diabète, d’albuminurie Il est tonique et purgatif Anti-leucémique Grâce à ses propriétés analgésiques, en application externe il peut traiter les douleurs articulaires et les ulcères veineux. C’est aussi un vermifuge, mais il y a très peu d’informations disponibles sur ce sujet, surtout concernant nos animaux de compagnie. Il a un seuil de toxicité extrêmement bas puisqu’il est utilisé comme additif alimentaire, mais il est difficile de faire la part des choses, surtout en ce moment, c’est pour cela que nous ne parlerons ici que de son utilisation comme antiparasitaire. Le quassia contient un composant du nom de quassine, est insecticide, larvicide et nématicide. Il attaque la chitine des larves de nombreux acariens et insectes, les empêchant ainsi de passer au stade de larve. Son goût amer repousse les puces, les acariens, les moustiques et autres insectes hématophages, et je comprends pourquoi. J’ai voulu gouter pour voir, c’est absolument horrible. Il y a peu de chance que votre compagnon quatre pattes le lèche plus d’une fois. Il existe des produits prêts à l’emploi, pas encore disponibles en France, qui ont des retours mitigés et auxquels les fabricants ont malheureusement ajouté des huiles essentielles, de sorte qu’on ne sait pas lequel de ces ingrédients fonctionne vraiment. De plus certains chiens – dont les miens - ne réagissent pas bien aux huiles essentielles, j’ai donc concocté mes propres recettes, testées et approuvées ! SPRAY REPULSIF 20 grammes d’écorce de quassia amara (si les morceaux d’écorce ou de bois sont gros, réduisez-les d’abord en poudre) 200ml d’eau 50ml de vinaigre de cidre Faire bouillir le quassia dans l’eau pendant 10 à 15mn, puis laisser macérer pendant quelques heures. Filtrer et presser l’écorce pour en extraire le plus de liquide possible. Il est aussi possible de le laisser macérer sans le chauffer, mais au moins une nuit. Dans les 2 cas, ne jetez pas le quassia, faites-le sécher car il peut être utilisé encore une ou deux fois. Laisser refroidir, puis ajouter le vinaigre. Vaporiser ou masser légèrement dans le pelage du chien pour repousser puces, tiques et acariens, y compris les aoutats. Si votre chien est infesté de puces, il est préférable de lui faire d’abord un shampoing, rincer, puis utiliser le spray ou mettre le quassia dans l’eau de rinçage. Ce mélange se conserve environ un mois. L’été dernier, pour la première fois en 10 ans de prévention naturelle, mes chiens ont eu une infestation de puces. Ce qui est curieux c’est que les crottes et les larves de puces étaient concentrées a un endroit bien précis sur chacun d’eux. Malibu et Yulia en avaient le bas du cou et le poitrail bardé, et sur Khéops c’était à la base de la queue. Lors de la première application j’en ai mis principalement sur ces zones, puis j’ai remis du produit sur mes mains et je les ai passé vite fait sur le reste de leur pelage. En moins de 48 heures il n’y en avait plus du tout. Les effets sur les puces ont duré environ deux semaines sur Khéops et Yulia et une dizaine de jours sur Malibu, lors de cette 1ere utilisation. Pour la seconde application j’ai utilisé le gel. En quelques heures les puces étaient parties et ne sont plus jamais revenues. D’après ce que j’ai pu trouver et observer, la durée d’efficacité dépend surtout de la qualité de votre produit, mais mes recherches indiquent un mois. Vous pouvez faire la macération dans du vinaigre de cidre au lieu de l’eau, cela se conservera plusieurs mois, et vous pouvez le diluer de moitié ou ¾ au moment de l’utiliser. GEL REPULSIF Réaliser une teinture mère en suivant les mêmes proportions que pour le spray au gattilier, puis mélanger en utilisant les mêmes proportions, soit : ¼ de teinture mère ¾ de gel d’aloé vera. Frictionner une petite quantité dans le pelage du chien. SPOT ON Mélanger quelques gouttes d’huile de neem avec la même quantité de teinture mère de quassia. Déposer quelques gouttes de ce mélange, sur le cou du chien, entre les omoplates et à la base de la queue. Vous pouvez le préparer à l’avance, il se conserve plusieurs semaines dans un flacon ambré et à l’abri de la lumière. Aucune idée de la durée d’efficacité, mes chiens n’ayant plus eu de puces, je n’ai pu tester cette recette.

Outre leur contenu en fibres et en vitamines, ils contiennent aussi des minéraux, mais surtout des antioxydants qui jouent un rôle essentiel dans la prévention de nombreuses maladies, y compris le cancer. Puisque nous sommes en été, le fruit-légume dont j’aimerais vous parler c’est la pastèque. Passons sur le fait que son prix est dérisoire, c’est un fruit intéressant entre autres grâce à son contenu en lycopène, un pigment caroténoïde et puissant antioxydant qui combat les radicaux libres. Parmi ses vertus on compte : Protection contre les toxines contenues dans certains pesticides Inversion de certains dommages causés aux glandes endocriniennes et au foie (1) et (2). Des vertus antifongiques et antibactériennes qui ont fait l’objet d’études, notamment dans le traitement de la gingivite et de candida albican (3) et (4). Prevention et traitement des infections urinaires Traitement des calculs rénaux Prevention de l’hypertrophie de la prostate Vertus anticancéreuses ((prostate, poumons, estomac, pancréas, colon et rectum, œsophages, bouche, sein et cervix) (5) Protection contre certaines maladies du cœur Retardement de certains troubles oculaires liés à l’age. Cela ne veut pas pour autant dire que donner une tranche de pastèque a votre chien toute les jours va le guérir du cancer ou l’empêcher de faire de la gingivite, mais que cela peut contribuer à une meilleure santé en général et surtout en été c’est un excellent moyen de l’hydrater. Autres composants intéressants de la pastèque ce sont les acides aminés comme la citrulline qui est convertie en arginine par les reins. Cet acide aminé est important pour la santé cardiaque et le système immunitaire, mais a aussi fait l’objet de recherches montrant ses valeurs thérapeutiques potentielles dans de nombreuses conditions dont : La démence La fatigue L’hypertension Le diabète La fatigue musculaire La performance athlétique La pastèque contient aussi du tryptophane, de l’arginine, de l'acide glutamique et de la lysine, des acides aminés précurseurs métaboliques de la sérotonine, un neurotransmetteur qui joue un rôle important dans la régulation du moral et de l’humeur. Autrement dit, la pastèque c’est bon pour le moral ! Ce fruit-légume n’est pas le seul à posséder de nombreuses vertus, mais là où il diffère de beaucoup autres, c’est que comme avec le cochon : tout est bon dans le melon (d’eau) ! Comme de nombreuses personnes, vous devez certainement jeter les graines et la peau, ce qui est une grosse erreur ! La peau du melon d’eau est encore plus riche en lycopène et en citrulline que sa chair, et elle contient aussi de la chlorophylle, et des vitamines A, B1, B2, B3, B6, et des oligo-éléments comme le calcium, le fer, le magnésium le phosphore, le potassium et le zinc. Les graines sont-elles-aussi comestibles et riches de ces mêmes vitamines, minéraux et acides aminés, et contiennent beaucoup d’ga-6 (30g pour 100g de graines séchées. Profitez de l’été, et gardez les graines au congélateur, vous leur trouverez une utilisation cet hiver. VALEURS NUTRITIONNELLES EFFETS SECONDAIRES ET PRECAUTIONS La pasteque etant riche en glucide, la question peut se poser si c’est une si bonne idée de l’inclure a l’alimentation de votre chien. La bonne nouvelle c’est qu’elle est aussi tres riche en fibres et ces fibres ralentissent l’assimilation des glucides par le système digestif de votre chien, evitant ainsi la montée brutale de la glycemie (6). Comme pour beaucoup de choses, le moderation vient a l’esprit. Trop de pasteque peut provoquer des problemes intestinaux, comme pour tous les fruits et legumes d’ailleurs. Il est possible aussi que l'urine de votre chien soit un peu plus teinté, n’ayez aucune crainte, c’est juste du a son contenu en βcarotene. Alors venons-en au fait, pour améliorer l’ordinaire de votre chien grâce à la pastèque fraiche, voici quelques recettes qui vous permettront de faire aussi un excellent usage de toutes les parties de la pastèque, y compris la peau et des graines. Si votre pastèque est bio, vous pouvez tout utiliser. Si cela n’est pas le cas, à l’aide d’un épluche pomme-de-terres, ôter la partie verte du fruit, et ne conservez que la pulpe blanche. Attention : alors que la pulpe de la pastèque et relativement digeste, et peut être donnée à votre chien en cubes, la peau en revanche doit être réduite en purée. SMOOTHIE A LA PASTEQUE 500g de pastèque coupée en cubes (chair et/ou ecorce) 500ml de kéfir de lait, lait de noix de coco ou eau de coco (non sucrés bien sur) Mettez les ingrédients dans votre bol mixeur ou à smoothie et réduisez en purée. Vous pouvez le verser sur les croquettes de votre chien, ou lui donner comme ca. CREME GLACEE A LA PASTEQUE 350g de pastèque coupée en cubes 350ml de kéfir F2 Mettez vos cubes de pastèque au congélateur quelques heures, puis passez les a la moulinette. Y ajouter votre kéfir, bien mélanger puis passer à la sorbetière. Si vous n’avez pas de sorbetière, les fruits étant congelés, une fois réduits en purée, vous pouvez vous en passer. Verser dans des moules a esquimaux. SORBET A LA PASTEQUE 1 litre de pastèque réduite en purée ¼ de litre de jus de fruit bio sans sucre ajouté, ou eau de coco Pelez et coupez la pastèque en gros dés, et ôtez les graines (ou pas). Mettre au congélateur plusieurs heures. Lorsque les morceaux de pastèque sont congelés, les passer à la moulinette pour les réduire en purée. Y ajouter doucement le jus de fruit et continuer de mouliner. Vous obtiendrez alors un mélange homogène que vous pourrez verser dans un récipient ou faire des esquimaux pour vos chiens avec ; même pas besoin de sorbetière. JUS DE PASTEQUE Couper la pastèque en morceaux et mettez toutes les partie, peau (sauf la partie verte si la pastèque n’est pas bio) et graines comprises, dans votre extracteur. Le jus de pastèque est particulièrement indiqué en cas d’infection urinaire, de calculs rénaux, et pour prévenir l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Pour les 4 recettes ci-dessus, vous pouvez verser votre melange dans de petits moules en silicones pour en faire des friandises gelées. THÉ AUX GRAINES DE PASTEQUE 20 à 30 graines de pastèque Réduire les graines en poudre dans un moulin à épices, faire bouillir 15mn. Filtrer et laisser refroidir. Aussi indiqué pour le traitement des infections urinaires, calculs rénaux et l’hypertrophie de la prostate. Faire boire ce thé au chien pendant 2 jours, faire une pause le 3eme jour, et recommencer, toujours 2 jours sur 3. C’est un puissant diurétique et c’est aussi un laxatif, ne pas abuser. De nombreux sites font référence a une étude de 2014 sur le sujet, mais je ne suis pas parvenue à la trouver. PASTEQUE DESHYDRATEE Si votre pastèque n’est pas bio, pelez la partie verte. Coupez la pastèque en tranche de 1cm d’épaisseur. Oter la peau que vous réserverez pour un autre usage et coupez la chair de la pastèque en morceaux et essayer de récupérer les graines. Etalez les morceaux sur une grille au-dessus d’un récipient pour récupérer le jus, et laissez égoutter une petite heure. Epongez les avec un torchon propre ou du papier absorbant, et mettre dans le déshydrateur. Pour des morceaux de cette épaisseur, cela prend environ 8 à 10 heures à 55 degrés. Il est conseillé de retourner les morceaux de pastèque au bout de 6 heures pour que ça déshydrate bien des 2 cotés, et de ne pas trop les serrer car beaucoup d’humidité va s’en échapper. Vous aurez ainsi d’excellentes friandises qu’il ne faudra pas entasser les unes sur les autres car elles vont se coller. Séparez les a l’aide de papier sulfurisé, et n’en donnez pas trop à votre chien, c’est une confiserie. Mesdames et messieurs, a vos tabliers!

      "www.phyto-animaux.com 1 Plantes médicinales pour les animaux : lesquelles et comment les utiliser ? Après avoir passé en revue les diverses raisons motivant les propriétaires à se tourner vers les médecines complémentaires pour soigner leurs animaux (lire l'article : \"Remèdes naturels pour animaux : une bonne solution ?\"), voyons ensemble quelles sont les solutions concrètes qu'ils peuvent utiliser pour aider très efficacement leur compagnon. SOMMAIRE : 1. Les diverses médecines : y voir plus clair 2. Phytothérapie, aromathérapie et micronutrition (= nutrithérapie) 3. Qu'est-ce que la pharmacognosie ? 4. Notion de \"Totum\" de la plante 5. Différences importantes entre plantes et médicaments chimiques 6. Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ? 7. Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie 8. Concrètement : quelles sont les solutions faciles pour les animaux ? 9. Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales 10. Quelles plantes choisir pour les maladies ? 11. Les huiles essentielles d'aromathérapie : des précautions importantes 12. Conclusion xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx 1. Les diverses médecines : y voir plus clair Les noms donnés aux médecines non traditionnelles sont nombreux et ces vocables regroupent beaucoup de médecines (ou de pseudo-médecines) différentes. On les appelle : - médecines \"douces\", mais ce terme ne convient pas car certaines d'entre elles sont tellement puissantes qu'elles sont loin d'être douces ! Par exemple : la phytothérapie peut faire appel à des plantes très toxiques comme la digitale, la belladone,.... ou comme le thuya pour venir à bout de certaines tumeurs ; quelques huiles essentielles de l'aromathérapie sont dermo-caustiques, etc. - médecines \"alternatives\" pour signifier qu'elles offrent le choix d'autres solutions que la médecine classique occidentale (appelée \"allopathie\") utilisant des traitements chimiques - médecines \"non conventionnelles\" car elles ne sont pas \"conventionnellement\" admises, prouvées ni reconnues par les autorités occidentales de santé - médecines \"naturelles\" car elles se basent le plus souvent sur des méthodes naturelles (plantes, massages, manipulations,....) - \"biothérapies\" car il s'agit aussi de thérapies pour la vie (\"bios\" en grec) www.phyto-animaux.com 2 - médecines complémentaires car elles peuvent être complémentaires des traitements classiques pour certaines maladies. Personnellement, les trois derniers vocables me semblent les plus appropriés, car ils signifient bien que médecine classique et médecine non conventionnelle ne s'opposent pas et peuvent même s'allier pour arriver à bout de certaines pathologies, offrant ainsi une solution naturelle, globale et plus efficace pour les soins et la guérison. Ces façons de traiter les problèmes de santé différemment sont très variées : phytothérapie, aromathérapie, micronutrition, homéopathie, acupuncture, médecine traditionnelle chinoise (MTC), ostéopathie, shiatzu, physiothérapie, kinésiologie,.... Remarque importante : Qu'elles soient qualifiées de \"douces\" ou de \"naturelles\", les médecines avec les plantes ne veulent pas dire \"sans danger\", car certaines plantes mal utilisées sont toxiques ! Dans le cadre du site de Phyto-animaux, nous évoquerons ici plus en détail 3 spécialités et leur définition : la phytothérapie, avec l'une de ses branches l'aromathérapie, ainsi que la micronutrition, aussi appelée nutrithérapie. 2. Phytothérapie, aromathérapie et micronutrition (= nutrithérapie) La phytothérapie est le fait de traiter, soulager et améliorer l'état de santé grâce aux plantes médicinales dont on commence à bien connaître les vertus thérapeutiques (par exemple la prêle comme reminéralisant pour les tendinites, l'harpagophytum comme anti-inflammatoire ostéo- articulaire, la mauve antispasmodique,...). Elles agissent comme compléments alimentaires à visée thérapeutique ou sont utilisées en usage externe. Les plantes peuvent s'utiliser sous beaucoup de formes différentes, chacune ayant leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients, surtout chez les animaux. Cet aspect sera évoqué dans le chapitre suivant. L'aromathérapie est une des branches de la phytothérapie, car elle fait appel aux plantes mais sous une forme particulière : les huiles essentielles. En fait, grâce au procédé d'hydrodistillation, on extrait les principes actifs des plantes (leurs molécules efficaces pour les traitements) qui vont se concentrer dans les huiles essentielles (HE). Vu la concentration parfois très élevée en molécules actives, certaines HE sont dangereuses, voir toxiques (dermocaustiques, abortives ou neurotoxiques,....). Les mélanges d'HE pour l'aromathérapie sont donc à faire préparer de préférence par des professionnels pour éviter les accidents. Pour la sécurité des animaux, nous les réserverons donc à un usage externe, sous forme diluée (voire très diluée) et de façon relativement réservée. La gemmothérapie est aussi une autre branche de la phytothérapie, qui fait appel aux plantes sous leur forme de bourgeons. On considère que le bourgeon de la plante regroupe en fait toutes les potentialités de la plante. Ils sont moins utilisés en phytothérapie vétérinaire. (L'ancien terme est \"phytoembryothérapie\"). www.phyto-animaux.com 3 La micronutrition, ou nutrithérapie, est le fait de traiter, soulager et améliorer l'état de santé par les nutriments, à savoir les minéraux, les oligo-éléments et les vitamines, dont on connaît aujourd'hui les rôles essentiels et leur importance dans la santé. En plus de pallier à d'éventuelles carences nutritionnelles (exemple : anémie due à un manque de fer, problèmes de peau dus à des carences en zinc,...), les nutriments peuvent aider l'animal à mieux récupérer lors de maladie, de convalescence, de vieillesse,.... 3. Qu'est-ce que la pharmacognosie ? La pharmacognosie est l'étude des principes actifs des plantes. Avec ces connaissances biochimiques récentes, on commence à connaître très précisément les actions pharmacologiques des plantes médicinales, ce qui fait avancer la phytothérapie et la fait sortir du simple domaine des \"rebouteux\" et autres remèdes de grand-mères empiriques, au profit des thérapeutes humains et vétérinaires. Ainsi, avec le développement de ces connaissances scientifiques sérieuses, on peut espérer que les traitements par les plantes soient un jour officiellement reconnus par la médecine classique (allopathie), acceptés et enseignés comme thérapies complémentaires. Etymologie : connaissance (\"gnosis\") du médicament (\"pharmakon\") Synonymes : phytochimie, phytobiochimie. 4. Notion de \"Totum\" de la plante : Une notion très importante en phytothérapie est celle de \"TOTUM\" de la plante. On considère que le totum est l'ensemble des molécules contenues dans la plante et qui permet à celle-ci d'avoir des propriétés médicinales efficaces. La plante forme donc une \"pharmacie globale\", une espèce de formule complète qui peut soigner, guérir, prévenir les maladies, d'où la notion de \"totum\". En effet, au niveau de sa composition chimique, on a constaté que la plante contient plusieurs principes actifs différents, dont les diverses actions sont complémentaires. Parfois même, ces molécules se potentialisent l'une l'autre. Si on utilise ces molécules isolées, on a une efficacité moindre que si on utilise toute la plante. Par exemple : si on extrait chimiquement l'harpagoside, la molécule active anti-inflammatoire de l'harpagophytum, on a une action anti-inflammatoire moindre que si on utilise toute la plante harpagophytum. D'où l'intérêt d'utiliser le plus possible la forme où la plante est présente dans sa totalité. 5. Différences importantes entre plantes et médicaments chimiques : Il faut bien avoir en tête que les plantes n'agissent pas exactement comme un médicament, même si leurs actions thérapeutiques sont réelles, voire parfois plus puissantes que les molécules chimiques. Leurs différences sont importantes : a) un médicament va en quelque sorte \"imposer\" son action sur l'organisme (si on ne veut pas dormir mais qu'on prend un somnifère, on dormira quand même), www.phyto-animaux.com 4 alors que la plante va plutôt \"proposer\" son action à l'organisme, sans rentrer dans un éventuel \"conflit\" métabolique (si on n'a pas besoin de vitamine C mais qu'on mange un citron, on ne va pas provoquer de situation problématique pour notre organisme ; mais si notre corps a justement une petite carence en vitamine C, la plante va lui en \"proposer\" et donc l'organisme va pouvoir se servir, en fonction de ses besoins). Les actions des plantes sont donc plus physiologiques sur l'organisme que les médicaments chimiques. Les plantes proposent, alors que les médicaments chimiques imposent. b) Le médicament utilise sur l'organisme plutôt un message de type quantitatif (dose-dépendant), alors que la plante envoie plutôt un message de type qualitatif (dose peu dépendante), ce qui explique notamment la raison pour laquelle il faut utiliser une petite quantité de plante pour voir une efficacité. Toujours pour reprendre l'exemple de la carence en vitamine C : manger un citron, quelques baies d'acérola ou quelques feuilles de persil sont amplement suffisants pour compenser ce manque. Et cet apport ne doit se faire que sur quelques jours pour que la carence disparaisse (il ne faut pas en prendre pendant des mois). Le médicament a une action quantitative, alors que la plante fonctionne plutôt sur un mode qualitatif (système de messagerie biologique). c) le médicament est le plus souvent composé d'une molécule active isolée (plus rarement 2 ou 3 molécules ensemble). Dans le cas de la plante, on utilise son totum, c'est-à-dire l'ensemble de ses molécules, ce qui permet leur synergie d'action. L'action de la plante est donc plus globale et plus efficace. d) le médicament est constitué de molécules chimiques, industriellement synthétisées, tandis que la plante est composées de substances naturelles et organiques, synthétisées par un être vivant (la plante) et disponibles pour un autre être vivant qui peut l'assimiler (l'animal). Cet aspect est important quand on sait que selon leur source de synthèse, les molécules peuvent avoir des conformations biochimiques dans l'espace différentes, ce qui a un impact réel sur leur efficacité. Par exemple : une molécule active peut être dextrogyre (D) ou lévogyre (L), un peu à la manière des gants, qui peuvent être gant gauche ou gant droit. Le plus souvent, la forme L est naturelle, alors que la forme D est synthétisée chimiquement, non reconnue ou mal utilisée par l'organisme. Si on utilise une forme D, le corps ne pourra pas bien l'utiliser. C'est comme si on imposait à une main droite de porter un gant gauche : cela ne fonctionnera pas. 6. Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ? Il existe de nombreuses formes de plantes, plus ou moins utilisables chez les animaux, avec un confort d'utilisation variable. De plus, suivant leur mode de fabrication, ces différentes présentations phytothérapeutiques conservent +/- bien les principes actifs (= les molécules efficaces) des plantes, permettant ou non l'assimilation du totum de la plante. Enfin, ces formes variées sont +/- compatibles les unes avec les autres ; c'est nécessaire à connaître si l'on veut faire des mélanges efficaces. www.phyto-animaux.com 5 Voyons ces différentes présentations, avec leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients : 1) les plantes fraîches : pas chez les animaux - forme peu pratique car il faut des connaissances botaniques parfaites pour ne pas se tromper dans leur reconnaissance et leur cueillette - odeur et goût trop forts (éventuellement valable chez le cheval) - conservation très limitée (car la plante fraîchement coupée fermente et pourrit très rapidement). 2) les plantes sèches en \"morceaux\" : peu pratique pour les animaux - ces plantes sont grossièrement découpées (par exemple des feuilles \"mondées\") - elles sont plutôt utilisées pour les tisanes en infusion ou en décoction (formes peu pratiques chez les animaux ; voir Chapitre 8). 3) les poudres de plantes sèches : forme la plus pratique pour les animaux réunissant plusieurs avantages, la poudre de plantes sèches est la forme la plus adéquate pour les animaux : - la partie de la plante utilisée est \"complète\", ce qui garantit d'avoir le \"totum\" de la plante - la concentration des principes actifs est naturelle (donc ni trop concentrée, ni trop diluée) - la transformation des plantes est réduite au minimum (cueillette + séchage), permettant la meilleure conservation des principes actifs qui ne vont donc pas être modifiés ou même dénaturés par diverses manipulations (distillation, extraction à l'alcool,...) - la forme sèche est stable et se conserve très bien dans de bonnes conditions (dans un pot en verre à l'abri de l'humidité) - les diverses poudres sont faciles à mélanger ; on peut donc aisément combiner plusieurs plantes pour obtenir toutes les actions désirées ; on peut aussi y rajouter des nutriments, se trouvant aussi le plus souvent aussi sous forme de poudres, ce qui facilite les mélanges (par exemple : un mélange contenant une plante anti-inflammatoire + une plante diurétique + une plante anti- œdème + du fer + vitamine C + vitamine B9) - l'odeur des mélanges de plantes n'est pas trop fort (il faut éviter certaines plantes comme le radis noir, la fumeterre,... mais ces plantes n'ont pas été retenues par Phyto-animaux pour les mélanges pour nos compagnons, et elles ne sont pas non plus présentes dans le listing des plantes en vrac proposées sur le site) - le goût est parfois un peu amer, mais pour les chiens et les chats, on peut mélanger cela avec de la pâté ou une \"ration maison\" (viande + féculent + légumes + jus de viande)* - le goût amer ne pose quasiment pas de problème chez les chevaux, habitués à manger des plantes ; pour les animaux un peu difficiles, on peut rajouter une poignée de graines avec un peu de jus de pomme (une fiche conseil est distribuée avec chaque phyto-préparation) - cette forme a le coût le moins cher et permet la meilleure adaptation du mélange à la maladie de son animal (personnalisation de la formule facile et efficace). * Dans la pratique, on observe depuis longtemps que si l'animal met parfois 1 ou 2 jours avant d'accepter le mélange, il le prend ensuite volontiers, comme si son organisme lui indique que ce mélange est bon pour lui et répond réellement à un besoin physiologique. De plus, on constate aussi souvent qu'après une période plus ou moins longue (15 jours, 3 semaines), l'animal commence à rechigner au mélange, comme si son organisme comprend que son corps n'en a plus besoin. www.phyto-animaux.com 6 4) les extraits fluides classiques : pas chez les animaux - les principes actifs des plantes sont extraits par plusieurs procédés successifs dans de l'alcool éthylique ; or il vaut mieux éviter tout solvant alcoolique pour nos compagnons - même si la conservation est bonne, le manque de choix des plantes et le coût souvent élevé de cette forme sont des inconvénients importants. 5) les extrait phyto-standardisés = EPS : forme utilisée chez les animaux - ils sont aussi appelés extraits fluides glycérinés - il s'agit d'une présentation liquide de plantes, traitées par le froid, subissant des extractions successives dans de l'eau et de l'alcool, puis après évaporation du solvant, il y a remise en suspension dans une solution glycérinée pour la conservation (glycérine = glycérol = alcool neutre faiblement toxique) - les principes actifs sont très dilués - la conservation est bonne, mais le manque de choix des plantes et le coût élevé de cette forme sont des inconvénients importants, ainsi que les quantités minimales importantes (flacons d' 1/2 litre pour chaque plante) - le goût parfois trop fort de certains EPS en limite l'usage chez les animaux (et les chats ne l'apprécient pas souvent) 6) les suspensions intégrales de plantes fraîches = SIPF : pas chez les animaux - il s'agit d'une présentation liquide de plantes, traitées par la froid puis mises en suspension dans l'alcool à 30°, ce qui n'est pas une forme adéquate pour les animaux - les principes actifs sont très dilués - la conservation est bonne, mais le manque de choix des plantes et le coût élevé de cette forme sont des points négatifs. 7) les extraits secs : pas chez les animaux - les principes actifs des plantes sont extraits par plusieurs procédés successifs dans de l'alcool éthylique ou dans de l'eau, puis on élimine le solvant pour obtenir une forme solide et sèche - ATTENTION : il ne faut surtout pas confondre cette forme avec les poudres de plantes sèches ! En effet, par cette méthode, les plantes subissent plusieurs manipulations parfois \"agressives\", dénaturant les principes actifs les plus fragiles des plantes ainsi traitées (ce qui n'est pas le cas des poudres de plantes sèches qui, elles, sont très peu manipulées et donc bien conservées \"en l'état\") - une mauvaise conservation et un prix élevé sont des inconvénients importants - les principes actifs sont très concentrés, rendant cette forme dangereuse pour les animaux, sensibles à une trop forte concentration des molécules actives. 8) les teintures-mères = TM, les teintures officinales ou les alcoolatures : pas chez les animaux - les plantes (sèches ou fraîches) sont macérées dans de l'alcool - les principes actifs sont très dilués www.phyto-animaux.com 7 - malgré la très grande variété de plantes disponibles et son coût très faible, cette forme n'est pas conseillé pour un usage chez les animaux à cause du solvant alcoolique. - (NB : teintures officinales et alcoolatures sont des formes anciennes qui ont presque disparu). 9) les huiles essentielles = HE : forme pratique mais à usage externe et avec certaines précautions d'emploi (voir Paragraphe 11) - les plantes subissent une hydrodistillation (distillation grâce à de la vapeur d'eau dans un alambic), concentrant ainsi une partie des principes actifs - ceux qui sont entraînés par la vapeur d'eau - dans des solutions \"huileuses\" qu'on appelle huiles essentielles (HE) et qui sont utilisées en aromathérapie - ces formes sont liposolubles ; elles ne se mélangent donc pas dans l'eau ou avec toute autre forme hydrosoluble (teintures-mère, hydrolats,...) - les principes actifs qui se trouvent dans les HE sont hautement concentrés, rendant leur utilisation très dangereuse chez les animaux pour qui n'a pas de connaissances solides en aromathérapie - ces formes liposolubles favorisent la toxicité de certaines HE sur le tissu nerveux, la toxicité digestive, les risques allergiques, la dermocausticité,... - NB : ce procédé d'extraction permet également l'obtention des hydrolats (voir paragraphe suivant) - IMPORTANT : PAS d'HE pour le CHAT car il ne les supporte pas (beaucoup sont toxiques pour lui et les quelques HE non toxiques le font baver intensément, ce qui n'est pas grave mais qui est très impressionnant pour le propriétaire et perturbant pour l'animal) (Lire aussi le Chapitre 11). 10) les hydrolats ou eaux florales : utile chez les animaux, surtout pour les chats - le procédé d'extraction des plantes est également l'hydrodistillation, mais on récupère la phase aqueuse pour obtenir les hydrolats - une partie des principes actifs de la plante sont présents, et hautement dilués - contrairement aux HE : ils ont une très faible toxicité et cette forme est hydrosoluble - leur utilisation est très pratique pour le chat chez qui les huiles essentielles sont déconseillées - leur coût est le plus souvent très abordable - malheureusement, la variété des plantes disponibles sous forme d'hydrolats est relativement faible (par rapport aux plantes sèches). 11) les bourgeons : peu utilisé pour les animaux - l'utilisation des bourgeons de plantes s'appelle la gemmothérapie - le bourgeon de la plante est mis en macération dans un solvant contenant de l'alcool et de la glycérine puis il est filtré ; on obtient alors un macérat concentré ou macérat-mère - par le passé, ce macérat-mère était ensuite dilué 10 fois dans un mélange eau/alcool/glycérine nommé macérat glycériné 1D (dilution à 1/10) ; il n'est plus trop utilisé actuellement - les principes actifs sont très dilués - comme il y a peu de références, cela ne donne pas beaucoup de choix de plantes. 12) les macérats (huileux): peu utilisé pour les animaux www.phyto-animaux.com 8 - il s'agit de plantes que l'on fait macérer plus ou moins longtemps dans une huile végétale (par exemple de l'huile de millepertuis, de l'huile de noisette,...) - c'est un type de préparation ancestrale, une méthode moins utilisée de nos jours - suivant l'huile végétale utilisée, le problème de conservation peut se poser - les principes actifs sont très dilués et ne sont pas en quantités connues ; cela ne permet donc pas d'avoir des préparations standardisées et fiables. 13) les fleurs de Bach : peu utilisé pour les animaux - elles sont aussi appelés élixirs floraux - il s'agit d'une forme liquide de certaines plantes - la variété des plantes est relativement restreinte - le choix de la plante se base sur des critères psychologiques et des symptômes émotionnels ; des réserves sont donc à émettre par rapport à leur utilisation chez les animaux, puisque les comportements sont différents de ceux des humains Commentaires pour la méthode des fleurs de Bach : le choix de la fleur de Bach pour le traitement est surtout lié à l'état psychologique de l'animal, mais cette façon de procéder pose question quant à son efficacité car : - au départ, les fleurs de Bach ont été élaborées pour des maladies humaines ; le fait de transposer cela aux maladies animales est une erreur énorme et fréquente - il peut y avoir un défaut d'appréciation de la situation psychologique de l'animal par son propriétaire (l'animal ne parle pas) - il y a des erreurs d'interprétation de son comportement, notamment car l'observateur peut avoir une mauvaise connaissance des comportements normaux chez les animaux (par exemple, on pense que le chien qui lèche la main après une punition veut se faire pardonner, mais en fait il récupère son statut de dominant !) - on peut toujours faire - même inconsciemment - une projection anthropomorphique sur l'animal (le propriétaire pense que son animal est déprimé, alors qu'en fait, c'est lui qui est déprimé) - on peut constater que certaines plantes utilisées sous forme de fleurs de Bach pour certaines maladies ne correspondent pas à l'utilisation classique de cette plante en phytothérapie. Il y a donc parfois non similarité d'action d'une plante entre sa forme d'élixir floral et sa forme d'utilisation classique (plante sèche, teinture-mère ou autre). Cela pose question quant à l'efficacité des fleurs de Bach, surtout quand la pharmacognosie (étude biochimique des principes actifs) donne de bonnes explications scientifiques pour la phytothérapie, mais pas pour les fleurs de Bach. En conclusion : Les formes de plantes les plus adéquates comme compléments alimentaires pour les animaux sont : - de préférence : les poudres de plantes sèches ; les hydrolats et les huiles essentielles pour l'usage externe uniquement (et avec beaucoup de précautions) - éventuellement : les EPS (et les macérats de bourgeons) www.phyto-animaux.com 9 Remarque : certaines plantes n'existent que sous forme sèche et d'autres qu'en tant qu'huiles essentielles, ce qui explique la complémentarité de l'utilisation des plantes avec de la phytothérapie et de l'aromathérapie. Certaines formes peuvent être utilisées chez les animaux, mais avec beaucoup de préparations ou de précautions d'utilisation (teintures-mères, plantes fraîches). Pour les autres formes, elles ne sont pas retenues pour les animaux, soit parce que leur utilisation ou leur efficacité pose problème, soit parce que leur forme n'est pas adaptée aux animaux, soit parce que leur gamme n'est pas assez développée ou trop chère (plantes sèches grossièrement coupées, extraits fluides, extraits secs, SIPF, macérats huileux, fleurs de Bach). 7. Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie a) Particularités des animaux suivant leur régime alimentaire : Les carnivores ont un régime de base carné, ce qui fait qu'ils fonctionnent sur un \"mode acide\" (pH inférieur à 7, allant de 5,5 à 6,5). A l'opposé, les herbivores tels le cheval, se nourrissent exclusivement de végétaux et leur organisme travaille plutôt sur un \"mode alcalin\" (alcalin = basique = inverse de l'acide ; pH supérieur à 7 et allant jusqu'à 8,5). Entre les 2, les omnivores que sont l'homme et le porc, se nourrissant aussi bien de viande que de végétaux, ont un mode d'activité métabolique agissant sur un niveau neutre (pH aux alentours de 7). Cette différence de niveau d'acidité résultant directement de l'alimentation est essentiel, car cela implique pour chaque espèce des mécanismes spécifiques, aussi bien pour les fonctions métaboliques que pour les réactions de défense par rapport aux pathogènes (microbes, bactéries, parasites,....). Quelques exemples : - normalement, l'acidité du cérumen des oreilles protège naturellement les chiens et les chats des parasites microscopiques provoquant la gale d'oreilles ; mais comme les chiens ou chats nourris aux croquettes ont un régime alimentaire trop alcalin (les céréales alcalines constituent la base des croquettes), leur cérumen des oreilles n'est alors pas assez acide et ils développent plus facilement cette maladie. Le nettoyage des oreilles avec une solution légèrement acide, ainsi qu'une alimentation adaptée (et naturellement acide comme la viande, la sauce tomate, le yaourt,...) va alors tout faire rentrer dans l'ordre (HE de lavande vraie pour le chien, la forme hydrolat pour le chat). - la majorité des calculs urinaires chez les carnivores sont plutôt de type alcalin (car croquettes trop alcalines) ; le traitement consistera à rectifier l'alimentation et à donner des plantes acidifiantes (canneberge,...). - les chevaux fonctionnent normalement sur le mode alcalin ; or beaucoup de maladies résultent d'une acidité temporaire (par exemple : trop de grains ou les jeunes pousses d'herbes trop vertes fermentent et enflamment la paroi de l'estomac, ce qui provoque des gastrites et ulcères gastriques). Un traitement utilisant des nutriments et/ou des plantes alcalinisantes permet de résoudre rapidement beaucoup de cas. (Vous pouvez aussi lire l'article \"Problèmes d'oreilles chez les chiens et les chats\"). www.phyto-animaux.com 10 b) Très grande variation de taille et de poids selon les animaux : Chez tous les animaux, on est confronté à une très grande variation de poids et de taille suivant l'espèce ou la race. Exemples : Pour les chiens, on peut aller du mini-Chihuahua de 500 g (vous lisez bien !) au Terre Neuve pouvant atteindre 80 kilos. Pour les chats, on va de mini-gabarits de 2 kg à certains très grands (gros) chats plafonnant à 10 - 12 kg. Les chevaux ne sont pas en reste, puisque le petit Falabella de quelques dizaines de kg fait partie de la même espèce équine que les superbes chevaux de traits atteignant 1 tonne ! Et même les bovins ont une très grande variété de poids, allant de 500 kg en moyenne pour une vache à près de 2 tonnes pour les taureaux les plus lourds. La conséquence est directe : il y a difficulté pour fixer la posologie ! Par chance, comme dit précédemment (voir Chapitre 5: \"Différences importantes entre plantes et médicaments chimiques\"), les plantes fonctionnent avec un mode de messagerie de type qualitatif, ce qui simplifie parfois ce problème de poids chez les animaux car on est moins \"dose-dépendant\" en phytothérapie qu'en pharmacie chimique classique. Ainsi par exemple, pour un mélange de plantes sèches pour un gros chien de 60 kg ou un cheval de 600 kg, la posologie sera de 15 g/jour en dose d'entretien, alors que la variation de poids entre ces deux animaux est d'un facteur 10 ! Ce problème de posologie ayant une conséquence directe sur l'utilisation de la phytothérapie, ce point sera abordé plus en détail dans le Chapitre 9 : \"Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales\". c) Olfaction et gustation : Les animaux ont un sens de l'olfaction particulièrement développé, surtout chez les carnivores. Or comme ils se servent de leur odorat pour accepter ou non telle ou telle nourriture, la moindre substance \"suspecte\" dans leur alimentation les feront rechigner à l'avaler. D'autant plus quand leur sens du goût confirmera leur suspicion, et c'est le cas avec les plantes, puisque leur amertume est parfois assez marquée. Cela peut évidemment être un frein quant à l'utilisation de la phytothérapie chez nos compagnons à 4 pattes. Néanmoins, les remèdes par les plantes sont tellement efficaces, et parfois sont les seules solutions disponibles pour certaine maladies que cela vaut vraiment le coup d'insister un peu pour arriver à les faire avaler à nos animaux. Que ce soit en les mélangeant avec leur nourriture, ou en rusant par l'incorporation avec une gourmandise qu'ils ne refuseront pas, ces traitements seront quand même ingurgités. www.phyto-animaux.com 11 Evidemment, la prise orale de mélanges phytothérapeutiques est plus facile chez les herbivores de par leur habitude à manger des plantes. Il est très intéressant de signaler que le plus souvent, après 1 ou 2 jours, on assiste à une acceptation fréquente de ces plantes, un peu comme si l'animal fait rapidement le lien entre le goût un peu bizarre et le bénéfice pour son organisme. Enfin, dans les phyto-préparations de Phyto-animaux, l'ajout de nutriments parfois appétents pour compléter \"la formule\" aide le mélange à être plus facilement ingéré. Le problème de l'olfaction est surtout plus important pour les huiles essentielles, puisque c'est justement cette particularité qui est caractéristique des HE, grâce à la très haute concentration en principes actifs. Si leur usage oral est déconseillé (ou à réserver aux spécialistes en aromathérapie vétérinaire), l'ingestion accidentelle est fréquente, surtout chez les carnivores. En effet, que ce soit le chien qui veut se débarrasser d'une pommade \"qui sent trop mauvais sur sa peau\" ou le chat qui fait sa toilette quotidienne, il arrive souvent que les huiles essentielles atterrissent sur le palais de nos compagnons. D'où l'intérêt d'utiliser les HE les moins toxiques possibles, et sous une forme diluée adéquate, limitant le risque toxique en cas d'ingestion, même non voulue. d) Métabolisation : Le cas du chat : La métabolisation est le processus de transformations des molécules en une forme qui permet leur élimination définitive par le corps. Cette métabolisation concerne aussi bien les déchets de l'organisme que les substances \"étrangères\" ingérées comme les médicaments, les plantes,... La métabolisation se fait essentiellement par le foie, d'où l'intérêt que cet organe soit fonctionnel tout le temps, impliquant un drainage régulier (minimum une fois par an ; lire les 2 articles concernant le \"Drainage de l'organisme\"). Chez les animaux comme chez l'homme, ces transformations se font en plusieurs étapes, grâce à diverses réactions biochimiques et selon des processus complexes. Pour résumer très simplement ces étapes, on peut dire que la métabolisation se passe en 2 grandes phases (la phase I et la phase II), elles-mêmes constituées de plusieurs grandes voies de transformation dont 2 principales (glucuronoconjugaison et sulfonoconjugaison). Si le métabolisme du chien et du cheval est très similaire à celui de l'homme, le chat constitue une exception très problématique, puisqu'il n'a, lui, qu'une seule de ces 2 voies qui fonctionne vraiment, ce qui le rend très sensible à beaucoup de substances qui sont très vite toxiques pour lui. Un exemple très révélateur : l'aspirine a son temps de demi-vie (sa vitesse d'élimination en quelque sorte) de 6 heures chez le chien ou chez l'homme, mais elle est de 36 h chez le chat, donc cela prend 6 fois plus de temps pour le chat de se débarrasser de ce principe actif ! Il est alors compréhensible que si le chat absorbe chaque jour (toutes les 24 h) une dose d'aspirine, il n'aura non seulement pas le temps de l'éliminer, mais en plus, il va l'accumuler, ce qui explique sa toxicité chez l'espèce féline ! www.phyto-animaux.com 12 Et chez le chat, c'est le cas pour tout un tas de substances, notamment beaucoup de molécules contenues dans les huiles essentielles (composants benzéniques, substances à noyau aromatique, phénols,...). Les animaux malades, vieux, sous traitement,... : Il est évident que les animaux vieux et/ou malades ont des organes affaiblis, notamment le foie et les reins, ce qui freine d'autant la métabolisation et l'élimination des molécules étrangères. Chez eux, il faut en tenir compte, même s'ils n'ont pas de symptômes correspondants (on peut avoir un foie \"fatigué\" sans pour autant être jaune d'ictère), notamment en choisissant des plantes adéquates, éventuellement drainantes, et en adaptant la posologie à leur cas. e) Elimination : Après la métabolisation, il y a élimination des déchets définitifs, qui se fait essentiellement par voie rénale. Pour rappel, le foie et les reins sont 2 émonctoires importants. Le problème, c'est que les reins sont un vrai point faible chez les carnivores (pour avoir une idée, 30% des chats décèdent d'insuffisance rénale). Il faut donc éviter de surcharger le travail de ces organes, en choisissant des plantes adéquates et en évitant des plantes ou des traitements inutiles, longs, lourds, ce qui est un argument de poids pour le principe de base de la phytothérapie : préférer des cures courtes et discontinues, pour justement éviter d'alourdir le travail de ces organes de métabolisation et d'élimination (voir Chapitre 9 : \"Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales\"). 8. Concrètement : quelles sont les solutions faciles pour les animaux ? En ayant bien en tête les diverses formes de plantes utilisables en phytothérapie (lire le Chapitre 6 : \"Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ?\"), on peut alors choisir les formes d'administration les plus adéquates pour les animaux. a. Le mélange de plantes sèches : Pour les animaux, c'est la meilleure solution car c'est la formule la plus facile, la plus pratique, la plus efficace et la moins chère. Cela permet de choisir les plantes qui conviennent à la maladie, en adaptant exactement le choix de ces plantes aux diverses actions recherchées. Par exemple : en cas de tendinite avec œdème, on va mélanger une plante anti-inflammatoire, avec une plante diurétique (drainage rénal), une plante anti-oedème, et une plante redonnant de l'élasticité aux tendons. Pour être le plus efficace possible, il faut de préférence connaître la cause du problème, et éventuellement comprendre la façon dont la pathologie s'installe (on appelle cela la pathogénie). Cela permet de choisir les plantes qui pourront freiner ou bloquer ces processus menant à la maladie, ou même cela pourra parfois empêcher la cause d'apparaître. Exemple : si un animal fait des tendinites à répétitions suite à un manque d'élasticité des tendons, on pourra empêcher le problème en redonnant de la souplesse à ces structures élastiques. www.phyto-animaux.com 13 Le fait qu'énormément de plantes existent sous forme de poudres sèches offre un nombre de possibilités quasi illimité pour l'élaboration de compléments alimentaires adaptés à presque toutes les situations. Et c'est une forme d'autant plus intéressante que la plupart des nutriments sont aussi sous une forme sèche, ce qui permet de combiner phytothérapie et micronutrition dans un même mélange, augmentant nettement l'efficacité du remède. C'est une formule très avantageuse quand on a un animal qui cumule les maladies, car les traitements peuvent s'additionner dans une même phyto-préparation. Exemple : si votre vieux chien atteint d'arthrose a un foie un peu fatigué et qu'il a un léger œdème pulmonaire, il peut bénéficier d'un seul mélange de plantes qui l'aidera pour ces 3 pathologies. En effet, on associera des nutriments et des plantes qui aideront son arthrose, draineront son foie et seront diurétiques pour diminuer œdème. De plus, comme elle est composée de plantes, contenant donc des substances naturelles, cette phyto-préparation ne surchargera pas son organisme. La prise quotidienne est relativement aisée car la quantité de poudres à avaler chaque jour n'est pas importante et qu'elle peut être mélangée à la nourriture (pâté, ration maison,...). La conservation de cette forme est longue si on garde ces mélanges de préférence dans des pots en verre, à l'abri de l'humidité. b. Les tisanes et décoctions : Il s'agit de faire infuser une plante ou un mélange de plantes dans de l'eau chaude, la décoction durant un peu plus de temps que l'infusion car elle concerne des plantes de forme plus \"solide\" (branchages, racines,...). A cause de l'odeur et du goût fortement augmentés dans les formes tisanes ou décoctions (à cause de la chaleur de la préparation), ces 2 procédés sont à éviter chez les animaux. Ces formes obligent à des manipulations plus importantes et une contrainte de temps non négligeable pour un traitement quotidien (chauffer l'eau, attendre l'infusion, attendre que cela refroidisse,...). La durée de conservation de ces préparations est très limitée car elles doivent être consommées dans les 2 à 3 heures qui suivent. De plus, on ne peut pas les conserver pour le lendemain - même au frigo - car l'eau favorise la multiplication microbienne rapide. Enfin, les plantes utilisables pour cette forme (feuilles grossièrement coupées, fleurs plus ou moins volumineuses, racines en morceaux,...) sont plus volumineuses et plus difficiles à conserver que les poudres sèches. Donc pour résumer, cette formule est à oublier pour les animaux car elle est peu pratique et accumule les désavantages : manipulation importante, contrainte de temps, conservation ultra- limitée, goût et odeur trop fortes pour les animaux, plantes plus difficiles à garder,... c. Le sirop d'EPS : Il s'agit du même principe que le mélange de plantes sèches, mais sous une forme différente : les extraits glycérinés. www.phyto-animaux.com 14 Le mélange de plantes constitue alors un sirop plus ou moins facile à faire avaler, car il se mélange difficilement à la ration et il faut donc le faire avaler à la seringue. Chez le chat, cette forme est très problématique car il n'apprécie pas d'être forcé à avaler un sirop souvent trop fort pour lui. C'est la même remarque pour un chien ou un cheval qui ne se laissera pas faire. Comme il s'agit d'une forme liquide, on ne peut pas envisager de l'additionner à des nutriments (sous forme de poudres), ce qui empêche la complémentarité pratique de la phytothérapie et de la micronutrition dans un même remède. Les désavantages de cette solution sont divers : goût souvent trop fort, palette de choix de plantes limitée, coût relativement élevé (par rapport aux poudres sèches) et difficulté de s'approvisionner en petites quantités, difficulté à l'utiliser chez le chat ou chez tout ... Néanmoins, c'est une alternative à éventuellement essayer puisque les solutions phytothérapeutiques ne sont pas nombreuses pour nos animaux. d. Les pommades ou les solutions huileuses avec des huiles essentielles : Elles sont à réserver pour un usage externe uniquement. Leur efficacité est très grande si le choix des HE est judicieux et adaptée à la maladie à traiter. Mais comme beaucoup d'HE sont toxiques, dermocaustiques,... il vaut mieux bien se renseigner ou utiliser des préparations vétérinaires sûres. Comme l'usage des HE relève de l'aromathérapie, une branche plus spécifique de la phytothérapie, les conseils et les précautions d'utilisation sont développées plus en détails dans le Chapitre 11 : \"Les huiles essentielles en aromathérapie : des précautions importantes\". Les autres formes de plantes sont à oublier car trop peu pratiques pour diverses raisons chez les animaux (voir le Chapitre 6 : \"Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ?\"). 9. Le dosage pour les différentes espèces animales : La très grande variation de poids et de taille suivant l'espèce ou la race peut poser problème en phytothérapie vétérinaire, comme on l'a vu dans le Chapitre 7 (\"Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie\") au paragraphe b (\"Très grande variation de taille et de poids selon les animaux\"), De plus, le choix des formes de plantes utilisées peut faire varier la dose pour les animaux (voir Chapitre 6 + Chapitre 8). La fixation de la posologie résulte donc de plusieurs facteurs : - l'espèce animale - le poids de l'animal - la forme de plante choisie - la durée du traitement. www.phyto-animaux.com 15 LES COMBINAISONS POUVANT ÊTRE INFIMES, NOUS ALLONS RÉSUMER ICI LES GRANDES LIGNES PRINCIPALES, UTILES, PRATIQUES ET EFFICACES CONCERNANT LA POSOLOGIE EN PHYTOTHÉRAPIE VÉTÉRINAIRE.  Posologies habituelles par voie orale pour un mélange de plantes : a) le mélange de plantes sèches : c'est la forme la plus pratique d'utilisation de la phytothérapie, que ce soit pour les chiens, les chats ou les chevaux. CHAT : 3 à 5 g/ jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chat (soit 1/2 à 1 petite cuillère à café) CHIEN : - 5 g/jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chien de moins de 10 kg (soit 1 cuillère à café) - 10 g/jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chien de 10 à 30 kg (soit 2 cuillères à café) - 15 g/jour d'un mélange de plantes pour un chien de plus de 30 kg (soit 1 cuillère à soupe) CHEVAL : - poney, petit cheval, âne (+/- 200 kg) : 10 g/jour (soit 2 cuillères à café) - cheval moyen (500 kg) : 15 g/jour (soit 1 cuillère à soupe) - grand cheval (700-800 kg) : 20 g/jour (soit 4 cuillères à café) Il s'agit de la posologie classique pour une dose d'entretien. Si nécessaire, notamment en cas de problème grave, ou pour rapidement atteindre une efficacité (par exemple en cas de douleur importante), on peut donner une dose d'attaque en doublant ces quantités journalières pendant les 4 ou 5 premiers jours de traitement. b) Une autre forme est éventuellement le sirop d'EPS : La posologie classique d'entretien est : - pour les chiens et chats : 1 ml par 5 kg et par jour (maximum 5 ml/jour pour les gros chiens) - pour les chevaux : 15 ml pour 400 kg, habituellement une fois par jour. Si nécessaire, on peut donner cette dose 2 à 3 fois par jour, mais il faudra alors diluer le sirop avec de l'eau. L'inconvénient est qu'il faut de préférence faire avaler à la seringue car l'odeur et le goût sont trop forts pour nos compagnons. Chez le chat ou l'animal difficile, cette solution est à oublier car il ne se laissera pas faire, en tout cas pas durant toute la durée du traitement. www.phyto-animaux.com 16  Durée des traitements habituels avec les plantes : En phytothérapie, il y a une grand principe de base qui est celui que tout traitement phytothérapeutique doit se faire en cures relativement courtes et discontinues. En effet, il ne faut normalement jamais faire de cures longues et continues sur plusieurs mois, car soit c’est inutile, soit cela risque de déséquilibrer l’organisme, soit cela va surcharger les organes de métabolisation et d'élimination (le foie et les reins ; lire le Chapitre 7 : \"Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie\"). La nature n'aime pas le \"trop peu\", mais elle n'aime pas le \"trop\" non plus. Pour préserver et favoriser la santé, il faut un juste milieu. Durée et Fréquence conseillées : - en cas de maladie classique : 1 cure de 7 à 10 jours par mois - quand la maladie est chronique ou que le cas est plus grave : => soit une cure plus longue de 10 à 15 jours (à reprendre éventuellement 10 jours plus tard) => soit 1 cure à faire 1 semaine sur 2. Malheureusement, ce principe n'est pas souvent respecté par les firmes vendant des traitements à base de plantes, puisqu'elles préconisent erronément des traitements longs et continus. En effet, ainsi elles vendent toujours plus, pour des raisons purement financières. Ces raisons vénales sont condamnables d'un point de vue éthique, moral et vétérinaire, puisque ces \"suremplois\" de plantes peuvent favoriser des déséquilibres de l'organisme, parfois tout aussi néfastes et dommageables pour le corps que la maladie primitivement traitée. Quelques exemples de problèmes avec des cures longues et continues : - donner non stop des probiotiques aux chevaux favorise les fermentations intestinales, et donc augmente très dangereusement le risque de coliques, une pathologie gravissime chez nos équidés - l'usage prolongé d'ail ou de reine des prés chez les chevaux favorise la fluidification du sang, pouvant déboucher sur des problèmes sérieux de micro-hémorragies ou d'hématomes très problématiques s'ils se trouvent dans le pied, pouvant mener à de la fourbure (lire l'article complet : \"Fourbure\") - l'utilisation de plantes diurétiques à long terme va littéralement \"assécher\" l'organisme, avec à terme des pertes hydriques et électrolytiques conséquentes sur l'organisme (par exemple une hypokaliémie provoquant des troubles cardiaques, des troubles nerveux et musculaires, de l'épilepsie secondaire,....) - certaines plantes contiennent beaucoup de minéraux utiles à l'organisme, mais toxiques en cas de surdosage (hypercalcémie, hyperkaliémie, calculs urinaires, calculs biliaires,...) www.phyto-animaux.com 17 - l'ortie, très intéressante en phytothérapie, contient aussi de l'histamine, une molécule stimulant l'immunité mais favorisant les allergies si l'organisme en est surchargé. Et les exemples de ce type sont légion, illustrant bien la nécessité de respecter la physiologie et de ne donner au corps que ce dont il a besoin. C'est ce qu'on résume avec le principe de cures courtes et discontinues. 10. Quelles plantes choisir pour quelles maladies ? Pour arriver à préparer un mélange de plantes qui sera efficient pour votre animal, il vous faudra connaître surtout 2 choses très importantes : 1) la maladie de votre animal, la cause de son problème et sa pathogénie (le processus d'installation et de développement du mal) 2) les diverses plantes et leurs actions respectives, ainsi que les molécules qui les composent (pour éviter les toxicités, les problèmes de métabolisation chez le chat,...). Chacun de ces deux points pouvant à lui seul représenter un gros ouvrage, il est donc évident qu'il n'est pas possible ici, dans un simple article, de parcourir toutes les maladies des animaux de compagnie, de décrire tous les traitements phytothérapeutiques possibles grâce aux plantes et d'établir la correspondance entre les deux. Cela représente un travail conséquent - qui est en cours - et qui fera l'objet de publications dans les mois qui viennent. En effet, 2 livres sont actuellement en préparation, l'un pour la phytothérapie chez les chevaux et l'autre pour les chiens et les chats. Mais ce qu'on peut déjà en dire, c'est décrire \"la philosophie\" et la méthodologie de base de la phytothérapie vétérinaire. Le principe pour élaborer un mélange de plantes se déroule en plusieurs étapes : 1) il faut cerner et bien connaître la maladie que l'on veut traiter chez son animal, en ayant des connaissance sur la cause et la pathogénie 2) il faut établir une liste de symptômes et des signes qu'il faut freiner, bloquer, améliorer ou arranger Exemple : pour un chien de 20 kg souffrant d'une tendinite avec œdème, on peut lister : - l'inflammation à diminuer - l'œdème à éliminer par un diurétique (draineur rénal) - le caractère \"accumulateur\" (l'œdème est un signe de maladie de surcharge) - d'éventuels faiblesses vasculaires qui favorisent la sortie du liquide hors des vaisseaux, faisant apparaître l'œdème - la cause probable : un manque d'élasticité des tendons qui sont normalement bien souples soit dans ce cas : 5 signes à améliorer www.phyto-animaux.com 18 3) choisissez 1 à 2 plantes de chaque catégorie de plantes adéquates proposées comme solution pour les symptômes (NB : ces catégories seront expliquées et bien décrites avec les plantes correspondantes dans les ouvrages en cours) Pour notre exemple : - l'inflammation => à diminuer avec une plante anti-inflammatoire - l'œdème => à éliminer par une plantes diurétique (draineur rénal) - le caractère \"accumulateur\", la surcharge => on peut drainer aussi le foie - d'éventuels faiblesses vasculaires => on va renforcer les vaisseaux avec une plante vasoprotectrice - la cause probable : un manque d'élasticité des tendons => on va utiliser une plante reminéralisante, riche en silice pour rendre les tissus plus élastiques soit dans ce cas : 5 plantes que l'on va récapituler et choisir comme suit : - une plante anti-inflammatoire => l'harpagophytum - une plantes diurétique (draineur rénal) => le pissenlit - une plante drainant le foie => l'artichaut - une plante vasoprotectrice => le cassis - une plante reminéralisante et riche en silice => la prêle Donc 5 plantes disponibles sous forme de poudre sèche 4) Vous calculez les quantités nécessaires : Sachant qu'il s'agit d'un chien de 20 kg, la posologie du mélange doit être de 10 g/jour pendant 10 jours (voir le Chapitre 9 : \"Le dosage\"). Donc il faut préparer un mélange de 100 g (= 10 g x 10 jrs). Comme on a choisi 5 plantes : le mélange de 100 gr est divisé en 5 composants = il faudra 20 g de chaque plante 5) Vous pouvez commander sur le site de Phyto-animaux les plantes de votre choix, dans des quantités minimales 6) Vous mélangez les plantes choisies en quantités adéquates : donc vous pesez 20 g de chaque plante et vous les mélangez de manière homogène 7) Vous donnez à votre chien une dose de votre préparation par jour, soit 10 g à mélanger dans la ration pendant 10 jours 8) Vous pouvez conserver votre phyto-préparation dans un bocal en verre, au frais et à l'abri de l'humidité (conservation : 1 an). Bien sûr, cette méthodologie est relativement simple. Mais c'est une bonne façon d'aborder la phytothérapie, en préparant vous-même un mélange simple mais déjà très efficace pour aider votre compagnon. C'est une bonne solution de base pour des maladies courantes et relativement simples. www.phyto-animaux.com 19 De plus, avec cette façon de penser et de faire, vous pourrez mieux analyser un éventuel traitement à base de plantes. Cela vous permettra d'être plus critique et plus armé pour dénicher les \"arnaques\". Enfin, les mélanges de plantes proposées sur le site de Phyto-animaux sont évidemment bien plus complexes et complets, car ils englobent aussi des nutriments complémentaires adéquats. Ils concernent aussi bien des pathologies \"simples\" (si vous n'avez pas envie de faire vos préparations vous-même) que des maladies beaucoup plus complexes. 11. Les huiles essentielles en aromathérapie : des précautions importantes De par le procédé d'extractions des principes actifs des plantes, les huiles essentielles sont hyperconcentrées en molécules biochimiques (lire le Chapitre 6 : \"Les plantes de phytothérapie : sous quelles formes ?\"). Ces molécules sont très variées, complexes et certaines sont très toxiques (phénols, aldéhydes aromatiques,....), ce qui implique que leur utilisation chez les animaux doit impérativement se faire par des traitements élaborés par un vétérinaire aromathérapeute expérimenté.  Voici les grands principes d'utilisation des HE chez les animaux : 1) n'utiliser les HE que pour un usage externe, de préférence sur une peau intacte 2) ne jamais utiliser les HE pures sur les muqueuses ou sur les plaies ouvertes 3) utiliser les HE sous forme hautement diluée dans un support huileux adéquat : pour un usage cutané, les HE doivent être mélangées dans un support gras (huile végétale comme l'huile d'olive, l'huile de noisette,...) et diluées à hauteur de maximum 10 % pour les HE les moins agressives (lavande vraie, tea tree,...) 4) ne pas utiliser les HE de manière prolongée (quelques jours de traitement suffisent) 5) éviter l'usage des HE dermocaustiques ou toxiques (comme celles contenants des phénols, des cétones, des aldéhydes aromatiques,...) : si vraiment leur usage est indispensable (bactéries résistantes aux traitements classiques, plaies très infectées,..), elles sont à diluer à une concentration de 1 à 2 % maximum dans un support gras adéquat. (On peut travailler avec des concentrations plus hautes, mais uniquement avec des préparations élaborées par un vétérinaire expérimenté et spécialisé en aromathérapie et avec un suivi médical rigoureux). 6) PAS d'HE chez les chats ! Préférer la solution alternative que sont les hydrolats : Même si quelques rares HE peuvent être utilisées chez lui, il vaut mieux être radical pour ne prendre aucun risque. En effet, la plupart des HE sont trop toxiques pour lui, notamment à cause des voies de métabolisation limitées chez lui (lire le Chapitre 7 : \"Les particularités animales et la phytothérapie\" au point d : Métabolisation) www.phyto-animaux.com 20 Et même si les HE ne sont pas toxiques (HE de lavande vraie), elles le perturbent fortement au point de le faire baver immédiatement et intensément ; ce n'est pas vraiment grave mais c'est terriblement impressionnant et cela effraie le propriétaire (qui croit souvent que son animal fait une crise d'épilepsie !). 7) PAS d'HE non plus chez les animaux jeunes, vieux, malades, en convalescence, gestants ou en lactation 8) avec les HE, dans le doute : on s'abstient ! 9) certaines HE peuvent être utilisée en aérolosothérapie (= inhalation = nébulisation), mais le plus souvent, il s'agit d'un traitement nécessitant un suivi vétérinaire (infection respiratoire, coryza sévère,...) 10) éviter d'utiliser des HE d'ambiance ou pour parfumer votre maison ou votre linge : les animaux, avec leur odorat performant, peuvent être fortement perturbés par ces molécules olfactives trop fortes pour leur narines délicates. Il s'agit d'une sorte de pollution olfactive (malheureusement de plus en plus fréquente), entraînant parfois des troubles de comportement ; surtout chez les chats (malpropreté, griffades, animal qui ne rentre plus dans la maison,...).  Un commentaire concernant l'utilisation éventuelle des HE contre les parasites externes (tiques, puces, mouches,...) : Dans le commerce, on trouve de plus en plus d'antiparasitaires externes à base d'HE ou d'autres substances naturelles. Malheureusement, ces produits ne conviennent pas pour diverses raisons : - soit les molécules naturelles sont associées à des molécules chimiques, rendant le produit toxique Exemple : rajout de perméthrine, toxique pour le chat (lire le paragraphe concernant le pyrèthre et ses dérivés, dans l'article \"Vermifuge pour chat : naturel ou chimique ?\") - soit le produit est vraiment naturel, mais les HE utilisées sont toxiques ou trop dosées, ce qui peut être source d'intoxication pour l'animal - soit le produit est naturel et ne contient que des molécules sûres, mais alors on aura un problème d'efficacité : ce produit n'aura pas beaucoup de résultats, ou alors il aura un effet qui ne durera pas dans le temps (problème de rémanence, c'est le cas des solutions naturelles anti-mouches pour le cheval). Certains vieux remèdes de grand-mère sont +/- efficaces mais limités à un usage pour les chiens uniquement : - placer des fougères fraîches ou sèches sous le panier du chien pour limiter les puces - mettre des sachets de lavande (en plantes sèches, pas en HE car pollution olfactive) - frotter votre chien avec du vinaigre pour éliminer les puces Ces \"trucs\" limiteront les parasites mais ne les élimineront pas tout à fait. Le recours aux produits chimiques dans la lutte contre les parasites est donc quasiment incontournable, mais le meilleur conseil est de ne les utiliser que si votre animal est TRES parasité. www.phyto-animaux.com 21 Il vaut mieux utiliser ces produits chimiques si la nécessité s'en fait sentir, quand votre animal est très dérangé, qu'il se gratte beaucoup ou s'il souffre d'allergie de type DAPP (dermatite allergique aux piqûres de puces), et non systématiquement chaque mois comme les fabricants le conseillent. En effet, par cet usage mensuel excessif et systématique, vous faites marcher la roue purement commerciale, vous intoxiquez inutilement votre animal et vous favorisez l'apparition de parasites résistants. Donc comme pour tout : faites-en un usage parcimonieux, réfléchi et uniquement si l'état de santé de votre animal le nécessite, ou que la présence de parasites est vraiment trop importante. 12. Conclusion : Pour résumer, les plantes chez les animaux sont une EXCELLENTE solution pour bon nombre de maladies, à usage préventif ou curatif, mais à condition de connaître les pathologies à traiter, ainsi que les formes des plantes utilisables, avec leurs avantages et leurs inconvénients, leur efficacité et leur toxicité éventuelle. Vous avec ainsi le choix : soit vous préparez le remède pour votre animal vous-même, après vous être bien renseigné auprès de sources sûres et sérieuses sur tous les paramètres (maladie, plantes, toxicité,...), soit vous choisissez de le traiter avec des phyto-préparations élaborées par des professionnels, vétérinaires, phytothérapeutes et expérimentés. Cela vous garantira l'efficacité du remède et la sécurité pour votre animal.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Tout comme pour nous humains, les dangers de la vie moderne tels que la pollution, la mauvaise alimentation, le stress et un mode de vie malsain, peuvent conduire à une variété de maladies chez nos animaux domestiques. Les médecines à base de plantes sont particulièrement utiles pour les conditions associées au système gastro-intestinal. Il n’existe qu’une poignée de recherche, mais une pléthore de témoignages, concernant le chardon-Marie en tant que traitement efficace et sans danger pour les animaux souffrant de tous types de problèmes hépatiques. Le chardon-Marie (Silybum marianum) est une plante à fleurs de la famille des Astéracées. Originaire des régions méditerranéennes de l'Europe, de l'Afrique du Nord et du Moyen-Orient, il est utilisé en médecine depuis plus de 2000 ans. C’est l'une des rares plantes largement acceptée par la science conventionnelle. Son ingrédient actif est la silymarine qui se compose de 3 flavonoïdes : la silychristine, la silydianine et la silybine. UTILISATIONS Le chardon-Marie est à présent préconisé pour une utilisation chez de nombreux types d’animaux comme les chiens, les chats, et les furets, mais aussi les chevaux, les chèvres et les rongeurs (attention il peut être toxique chez les moutons et les vaches). De nombreux vétérinaires holistiques le recommandent pour les problèmes suivants: - Stéatose hépatique - Hépatite chronique - Lipidose hépatique (chez le chat) - Hépatomégalie FOIE - Cholangite (inflammation des voies biliaires) - Péricholangite (inflammation du tissu autour des canaux biliaires) - Prévention des calculs biliaires - Récupération après une maladie qui touche le foie, comme le parvovirus et la leptospirose - Intoxication due aux insecticides, aux pesticides, aux champignons vénéneux, à la vaccination et à certains traitements médicamenteux - Association à des traitements dans les infections dues à des protozoaires - Allergies - Diabète AUTRES AFFECTIONS - Maladies inflammatoires de l’intestin (MII) - Support du système immunitaire - Cancer Les maladies du foie sont plus fréquentes qu’on ne pense chez les animaux de compagnie. Certaines races de chiens ont aussi une prédisposition génétique aux maladies du foie, comme la toxicose au cuivre chez les Terriers de Bedlington, les labradors retrievers, les dalmatiens, les Dobermans Pinschers et les dogues allemands. Beaucoup de maladies ont aussi une incidence sur le foie, que cela soit le problème d’origine ou un effet secondaire. Les fonctions du foie vont aider le métabolisme et la digestion au stockage de l'énergie, à la fabrication du sang et à la production des enzymes nécessaires pour une variété de fonctions au maintien de la vie, à stimuler la croissance de nouvelles cellules hépatiques pour remplacer celles mortes ou endommagées. Les bactéries et les virus, les traitements médicamenteux, les toxines, les radicaux libres (les produits chimiques dans notre corps) et l'inflammation sont tous responsables de dommages sur le foie. L'exposition à des toxines environnementales peut augmenter les radicaux libres dans le corps, ce qui peut endommager nos cellules. Ceci est appelé oxydation et peut éventuellement conduire au cancer, aux maladies cardiaques, à l’arthrose, etc. Le chardon-Marie est un antioxydant puissant et la recherche montre qu’il protège le foie contre l'oxydation en empêchant les radicaux libres, et contribue également à le réparer. Lorsque votre animal reçoit un traitement préventif contre les vers de cœur, les tiques ou les puces, il reçoit des produits chimiques qui sont difficiles à gérer pour son foie. Le chardon-Marie doit être considéré comme une aide à la guérison après un traitement médicamenteux, une vaccination, et une infection telle que le parvovirus canin ou la leptospirose, ainsi que les traitements contre le cancer. Rodney Habib, nutritionniste canin de renommée mondiale, indique que «La désintoxication est un processus aussi important non seulement pour nous les humains, mais aussi pour nos animaux de compagnie. Nous pouvons donner à nos poilus bien-aimés les meilleurs aliments du monde, si les pores sont obstrués par des toxines, cela ne permettra pas aux éléments nutritifs essentiels d’être assimilés, provoquant un affaiblissement du système immunitaire. L’affaiblissement du système immunitaire d'un animal est la cause d’une multitude de problèmes ! ». Historiquement, le chardon-Marie a été utilisé avec succès comme un antidote d'urgence contre l'empoisonnement aux champignons, si donné dans les 24 heures, car il réduit considérablement les dommages au foie qui peuvent être mortels. Un bon fonctionnement du foie contribue aussi à combattre les allergies. D’après Mark. E. Richardson, médecin et auteur : « Le foie doit traiter les toxines et quand il ne peut pas faire son travail, il les stocke. S’il les stocke il produit aussi des histamines supplémentaires pour se protéger. Si un allergène est présent, le cerveau envoie un message : \"Envoyez quelques histamines! Je crois qu'il y a un envahisseur !! \" Le foie en produit et en libère trop, et vous avez la réponse allergique ». (http://ezinearticles.com/?The-True-Cause-Of-Allergies---Its-In-The-Liver&id=439043). De nombreux chiens souffrant de maladie intestinale inflammatoire (IBD) ont une inflammation simultanée du système hépatique / biliaire et du pancréas. Parce que les actions bénéfiques du chardon se concentrent sur ​​les systèmes du foie et des voies biliaires, il peut également être utile chez les chiens souffrant de ce type de pathologie. Une étude de l'Université Case Western Reserve en Ohio conclut que « la silymarine possède des effets protecteurs exceptionnellement élevés contre la croissance de la tumeur ». D’autres études en laboratoire suggèrent également que les extraits du chardon-Marie peuvent avoir des effets anti-cancer. En particulier, ces études ont montré qu'il peut ralentir la croissance de certaines cellules cancéreuses, qu'il peut potentialiser ou améliorer l'activité de certains médicaments de chimiothérapie, et qu'il peut protéger en empêchant les cellules de se diviser, en raccourcissant leur durée de vie et / ou en réduisant l'apport sanguin vers les cellules cancéreuses. La recherche se poursuit en ce qui concerne le rôle de la silymarine dans le traitement du cancer, en particulier si elle doit être évitée dans le traitement du cancer du foie (car s’il favorise la régénération du foie, il pourrait éventuellement stimuler la croissance de certains types de cancer du foie). Donc à suivre sur ce dernier point. Une étude humaine suggère même son rôle contre le diabète grâce à ses effets de normalisation sur les globules rouges. Il peut aussi aider à prévenir la neuropathie diabétique, une complication fréquente de la maladie qui provoque une dégénérescence des nerfs contrôlant les membres postérieurs, et qui produit par conséquent une faiblesse et une démarche anormale. D'autres recherches suggèrent que le chardon-Marie favorise la fonction rénale chez les patients ayant des lésions rénales dues au diabète. Le chardon-Marie soutient généralement le système immunitaire grâce à ses puissants antioxydants, l'action anti radicalaire, sa capacité à préserver l'approvisionnement d'un autre antioxydant important, le glutathion, ainsi que des effets directs sur les cellules immunitaires. Le glutathion, qui est stocké principalement dans le foie, diminue naturellement avec le temps, et l'épuisement de cette protéine semble accélérer le processus de vieillissement. EFFETS SECONDAIRES PRECAUTIONS D’EMPLOI Avant d'ajouter cette plante miracle au régime quotidien de votre chien juste au cas où il pourrait faire du bien, il est important de réserver ce traitement à une maladie existante, ou comme un moyen de nettoyage du foie après une exposition à des toxines, mais pas à titre préventif. Bien que l'utilisation modérée du chardon-Marie soit très sûre, l'ingestion de doses très élevées à long terme finira par supprimer la fonction du foie. Donc, comme pour tout supplément, user mais ne pas abuser. Chez les animaux, quelques effets secondaires mineurs peuvent occasionnellement survenir pendant un traitement au chardon-Marie, même en suivant les directives de dosage. Certains chiens peuvent avoir des selles molles ou des gaz, le problème est facilement résolu en diminuant la dose ou en arrêtant le traitement. Concernant une utilisation chez les femelles gestantes et allaitantes, les informations à ce sujet sont contradictoires. Le chardon-Marie pourrait aussi interférer avec le métabolisme d'un certain nombre de médicaments et stimuler les effets des hormones telles que les œstrogènes, et donc réduire les effets des contraceptifs chez les humains (cette dernière information ne concerne pas vraiment nos animaux de compagnie, mais il vaut mieux trop d’information que pas assez). Le livre “The Complete Holistic Dog” de Jan Allegretti et Katy recommande le chardon-Marie pour les chiens épileptiques lorsqu’ils sont sous phénobarbital pour contrôler les crises, car il peut aider à protéger le foie contre les dommages résultant de ce traitement hépatotoxique. Le chardon-Marie augmentant l’efficacité de certaines drogues, là encore, consultez votre vétérinaire naturopathe pour voir si la dose de phénobarbital peut/doit être réduite lors de la prise de chardon-Marie. De toute évidence, si votre animal est sous traitement, il est préférable de consultez un professionnel, avant de lui administrer ce supplément en conjonction avec un traitement médicamenteux. En Allemagne où le chardon-Marie est approuvé par le gouvernement, il est considéré comme tellement sûr qu'il n'y aucune mise en garde contre son utilisation, même pendant la grossesse et l'allaitement. Les rapports d’effets secondaires indésirables ou d’interactions sont rares. Les recherches à ce sujet étant encore peu concluantes, et certains éléments trouvés contradictoires, suivez mon moto : « Dans le doute, abstiens-toi ». Enfin, certains medicaments etant modifiés, affectés, ou partiellement decomposés par le foie, leur assimilation pourrait etre ralentie par l'utilisation du chardon-Marie, ou cela pourrait aussi augmenter leurs effets secondaires il faut donc mieux éviter de les donner en meme temps. Parmis ces medicaents on compte notamment ceux qui continennet de l'amitriptyline, du diazepam (Valium), du zileuton, du celecoxib, du diclofenac (Voltaren), du fluvastatin (Lescol), di glipizide), de l'ibuprofen (Advil), de l' irbesartan, de l'losartan, du phenytoin (Dilantin), du piroxicam,, du tamoxifen, dutolbutamide, du torsemide (Demadex), de la warfarine (Coumadin), etc. DOSAGE Avant tout chose, il convient de préciser au lecteur que le dosage dont nous parlons ici est en silymarine, le composant actif du chardon-Marie. Les extraits de chardon-Marie disponibles aujourd'hui contiennent des % de silymarine différents, regardez donc bien l'etiquette avant d'acheter et calculez la dose requise pour votre animal en fonction de cela. On peut l’acheter sous forme de poudre, de capsules et d'extrait liquide (teinture mère). Prenez aussi en compte la taille de votre animal, et le dosage dont il aura besoin. En cas de doute sur une marque, venez nous poser la question sur Facebook. Chez les humains des études ont montré que le chardon-Marie était plus efficace lorsqu’administré en plusieurs fois au cours de la journée, plutôt qu’en une large dose quotidienne. Lorsqu’il n’est pas possible de diviser la dose quotidienne en 3 ou 4 fois, il faut la répartir en au moins 2 fois par jour. Pour une détox après l’administration d’un antiparasite chimique (interne ou externe) : 1 semaine après le traitement, une cure de 3 semaines. Après un long traitement/dur traitement médicamenteux : donner en plusieurs cures de 3 à 6 semaines, et faire des pauses de 1 à 3 semaines entre chaque. Prenez une marque de qualité, qui contient 70 a 80% de sylimarine, et qui NE CONTIENT PAS DE XYLITOL (parfois appelé sucre de bouleau) .Le dosage est de 5mg à 10mg par kg de poids vif, selon que c'est pour une détox ou un problème avéré comme un taux d’enzymes hépatiques légèrement élevé. Dans certaines pathologies sérieuses ou graves, vous pouvez même aller jusqu’à 50mg par kg de poids vif, mais sous la supervision d’un vétérinaire naturopathe ; J’insiste sur ce dernier point. 1- CALCUL PAR RAPPORT À LA POSOLOGIE POUR HUMAINS Trop compliqué ? Je vous comprends. D’un pays à l’autre, le conditionnement est différent et les étiquettes ne sont pas toujours faciles à comprendre. Vous pouvez donc opter de calculer le dosage pour votre animal, par rapport à la posologie pour humains, mais sachez que ce dosage aura tendance à être un peu moins précis et en-dessous de celui-calculé par rapport au % de silymarine ci-dessus. Si la posologie recommandée sur la notice indique un nombre différent de comprimés/gélules par jour, selon la pathologie à traiter, servez-vous du tableau ci-dessus pour déterminer si votre animal requiert la dose minimum ou une plus élevé. Par exemple : la notice indique « pour un adulte, 1 à 3 comprimés par jour » : Si vous voulez juste faire une détox après un traitement antiparasitaire chimique, prenez 1 comprimé/jour comme base. Si votre animal de compagnie a un taux d’enzymes légèrement élevé, prenez 2 comprimés/jour comme base. Si votre animal a un taux d’enzymes assez élevé, prenez 3 comprimés/jour comme base Mais si comme pour la marque que j’utilise, il n’y a qu’une posologie de 1 comprimé/jour, le tâche va s’avérer difficile, d’où l’importance de bien calculer votre coup avant d’acheter. LE TABLEAU CI-DESSOUS EST POUR LES NOVICES, C'EST ON NE PEUT PLUS SIMPLE! Regardez l'étiquette du produit que vous avez selectionné, combien de comprimes ou gelules par jours ils recommandent pour un humain, et faites le calcul. N'oubliez pas que pour une meilleure efficacité, vous voudrez repartir la dose en 2 ou 3 prises par jour. 2- SOUS FORME D'EPS (EN PHARMACIE) 1ml/5kg de poids corporel, ne pas depasser 5ml meme pour un gros chien. Nous vous conseillons la marque PhytoPrevent des laboratoires Pileje, que vous pouvez faire preparer sur certains sites en ligne dont Soin Et Nature, ou en pharmacie-conseil PhytoPrevent. Pour trouver leurs points de vente pres de chez vous, rendez-vous sur leur site : https://www.pileje.fr/nous-trouver/pharmacies, et tappez votre code postal.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Ce matin, lors de notre randonnée matinale j’ai cueilli quelques cenelles, et je voulais partager leurs bienfaits avec vous. Pour la petite histoire, c’est notre chienne Yulia qui me les a fait découvrir. Nous avons recueilli Yulia lorsqu’elle n’avait qu’une dizaine de semaines et avait été abandonnée dans la campagne, livrée à elle-même pendant quelques jours. Elle a survécu en se nourrissant de tout ce qu’elle trouvait, baies sauvages comprises. C’est comme cela qu’un jour en promenade, je l’ai vue manger des baies rouges que je suis empressée de lui faire cracher au cas où elles seraient toxiques. De retour à la maison, je m’étais renseignée et découvert qu’il s’agissait de cenelles, non seulement un fruit comestible, mais plein de bienfaits pour nos chiens. Elle semble connaître celles qui sont comestibles et celles qui ne le sont pas. La cenelle est le fruit de l'aubépine, un excellent cardiotonique. Sa capacité à faire lentement baisser la tension artérielle est documentée, bien que le mécanisme de son action soit incertain. L’aubépine ne bloque pas les canaux calciques et n’agit pas non plus comme diurétique. En fait c’est un excellent moyen de réduire la tension artérielle même pour les animaux diabétiques ou ceux qui ont des problèmes de reins. Les feuilles, les bourgeons, les fleurs et les baies d’aubépine améliorent la fonction générale du cœur, stabilisent et renforcent un rythme cardiaque faible ou irrégulier. L’aubépine est si performante que des études démontrent qu’elle est tout aussi efficace que la digitaline, sans ses effets nocifs. Il n'y a pas de danger d'effets secondaires ou danger cumulatif et elle peut aider à réduire la dose de digitaline de moitié. L’aubépine est riche en flavonoïdes et en antioxydants qui sont bons pour le cœur et les vaisseaux sanguins à bien des égards, leurs effets anti-inflammatoires puissants relaxant les vaisseaux sanguins. Leur action anti- microbienne stoppe les infections comme celles des gencives, qui peuvent nuire au cœur. Ses flavonoïdes – le pigment rouge des baies d'aubépine – sont le composant le plus responsable de son effet tonique, et qui soutiennent le bon fonctionnement du système immunitaire et du foie. La cenelle est le fruit qui contient la plus grande source naturelle de flavonoïdes. Enfin, elle contient aussi beaucoup de vitamine C. Elle est bénéfique pour les chiens âgés, ceux souffrant d'insuffisance cardiaque, ceux qui ont des anomalies cardiaques à la suite d’un traitement contre les vers de cœur, une infection ou un traitement de chimiothérapie, mais aussi pour les chiens de travail. Elle renforce l'appétit et la digestion, et aide aussi la circulation sanguine du foie et des reins. Pour compléter les besoins supplémentaires d'animaux plus âgés, elle peut être donné en combinaison avec : Le ginkgo ou l'achillée millefeuille pour renforcer les parois des capillaires et améliorer l'approvisionnement en sang vers les reins et les extrémités, L'ail pour le soutien du système immunitaire, La luzerne et le trèfle rouge pour nourrir le sang, augmenter l'appétit et les niveaux d'énergie, La feuille de pissenlit pour aider à l'élimination des excès d'eau, L’avoine fleurie (sommités d’avoine fleurie) comme un tonique du système nerveux. LISTE DES BIENFAITS Pour Le Cœur : Régularise la tension artérielle, Accroît l'efficacité de l'action de pompage du cœur et renforce le muscle cardiaque, Regularise le rythme cardiaque, Dilate les artères coronaires, Prévient les maladies cardiaques, les crises cardiaques et les AVC, Agit comme sédatif, réduire l’anxiété et la sensation d’oppression, combat l’insomnie, Aide à réparer les dommages causés par les vers de cœur, après le traitement. Pour l'Appareil Digestif : Traite les indigestions, la diarrhée, les maux d’estomac, Traite contre le ténia, Protège le foie lors de crises cardiaques, détoxifie le foie. Pour La Santé Générale : Aide à la perte de poids en évitant la rétention d'eau, Soulage l’asthme en augmentant la capacité naturelle du corps à utiliser l'oxygène, Soutient le système immunitaire. ADMINISTRATION Tisane : La tisane d’aubépine se fait par trempage de 2 deux cuillerées à café de feuilles et de fleurs séchées dans une tasse d'eau bouillante pendant vingt minutes. Infusion : Une infusion d’aubépine se fait par macération de 30g de fleurs et de feuilles séchées ou 30g de cenelles séchées dans un litre d'eau bouillante pendant au moins quatre heures, que l’on laisse refroidir. Teinture Mère : La teinture mère d'aubépine se fait en macérant des cenelles séchée dans de l’alcool de fruit pendant au moins 6 mois, ou jusqu'à ce que l’alcool devienne rouge. Macérat Hydroglycériné : 20g de cenelles bien mûres, 50ml de glycérine végétale, 50ml d’eau, 0,6% d’EPP de qualité alimentaire. Mettre tous les ingrédients dans un bocal hermétique et laisser macérer à l’abri de la lumière et à température ambiante 2 à 3 semaines. Le macérait doit avoir pris la couleur des baies. Filtrez et pressez à travers une gaze (se conserve 6 mois au réfrigérateur). Vinaigre De Cenelles : 450ml de vinaigre de cidre bio non pasteurisé + le même volume en cenelles. Mettre les cenelles dans un grand bocal, verser le vinaigre dessus et fermer hermétiquement. Laisser macérer au moins 3 semaines à l’abri de la lumière et à température ambiante, et secouer tous les jours. Filtrer et doser à raison de : 1 cac de 1 à 5kg de poids corporel 2 cac de 5 a 15kg 3 cac de 15 a 50kg 4 cac 50kg + Cenelles entières : 2 cuillers à café de cenelles fraîches ou séchées par kg de nourriture, par jour. Macérat concentré (Herbalgem ou Phytogem) : 1 goutte/10kg de poids corporel, 2 a 3 fois par jour, en commencant par la moitié de cette dose et en augmentant progressivement ou la quantité ou le nombre de prises.

Toute reproduction ou exploitation de ces contenus est strictement interdite sans accord écrit préalable Aujourd'hui je vais vous parler de trois plantes aux vertus répulsives que j'ai découvertes au cours des derniers mois, et que vous pouvez utiliser sur vos chiens et chats. PREMIER VOLET : LE CISTE (CISTUS INCANUS/CRETICUS) Le ciste (ou cyste) est une plante aromatique, médicinale et apicole de grande valeur, qui pousse dans de nombreuses régions du bassin méditerranéen. Il appartient à la famille des cistacées qui comprend une cinquantaine d'espèces reconnues, mais celle qui nous intéresse tout particulièrement est Cistus Incanus/Villosus/Creticus, originaire de Grece. Ses feuilles ont une très haute teneur en polyphénols (5), une capacité étonnante à détruire les radicaux libres, et une activité antioxydante élevée. Il existe d'autres type de ciste, dont le ciste ladanifère, originaire d'Espagne, mais qui est beaucoup moins intéressant car il contient bien moindre concentration de composants actifs (19). Toutes les parties aériennes de la plante sont couvertes de poils glandulaires solitaires qui, pendant la saison chaude, libèrent une sécrétion résineuse du nom de labdanum pour se protéger contre la déshydratation et les UV. Cette oléorésine est recherchée depuis la nuit des temps, elle est particulièrement aromatique, et est utilisée dans la fabrication d’encens et de parfums. Elle contient des diterpènes lithiques et une étonnante concentration de polyphénols, notamment des proanthocyanidines, des bioflavonoïdes, des catéchines, de l’acide gallique, et des rutines, possédant tous des propriétés pharmacologiques intéressantes. Ce phénomene ne se produit qu'en Crete a cause du climat, donc meme si comme moi vous trouvez du cistus créticus dans votre région (et je vis en Grece, mais dans le nord), il ne sera pas d'assez bonne qualité pour ces préparations. Le ciste compte un large spectre de vertus thérapeutiques comme : Une activité antimicrobienne et cytostatique (qui bloque la prolifération cellulaire et empêche la formation de tumeurs (en particulier les sarcomes), ce sont les mêmes propriétés que la chimiothérapie). Ralentit le vieillissement cellulaire, Antihémorragique, Grâce a ses polyphénols qui inhibent la libération d'histamine, il possède des propriétés antiallergiques, Apaisante du tube digestif, soulage l’inflammation du tractus gastro-intestinal, améliore la flore intestinale, Détoxifie des métaux lourds (cadmium), et notamment de la contamination environnementale ; soutient le foie et le pancréas. Module le système immunitaire (18), Anti-infectieux, antiviral et antifongique(6), il inhibe notamment la croissance de certains micro-organismes comme les bactéries coliformes (E. Coli), les Candida albican, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, et Aspergillus fumigatus ; des études ont d’ailleurs démontré qu'il était efficace contre certains rétrovirus comme la grippe, le Sida et la maladie de Lyme (1, 2, 3 ) Astringent, antispasmodique, expectorant, analgésique, réduit les symptômes de la bronchite. Utile à titre prophylactique pour prévenir les rhumes et autres maladies (8), Tonique, il augmente l'énergie et la vitalité, Il est anti-inflammatoire et traite une multitude de maladies chroniques et auto-immunes, dont les problèmes articulaires, Cicatrisant, il traite certaines maladies de la peau comme l’eczéma et les démangeaisons, soulage les irritations cutanées, etc (7). Favorise la santé bucco-dentaire en décomposant le biofilm dentaire (plaque dentaire), Augmente la barrière protectrice naturelle contre les parasites externes. C’est ce dernier point qui nous intéresse tout particulièrement. En effet, je suis tombée par hasard sur l’utilisation du ciste comme répulsif contre les tiques et les moustiques (et peut-être aussi contre les puces) lors d’une rencontre avec un berger alors que nous promenions nos chiens dans la garrigue. En discutant avec lui, je mentionnais que nous aimerions bien avoir un ou 2 moutons dans notre cour pour manger l’herbe, mais que je craignais qu’ils attrapent des tiques et deviennent un réservoir potentiel. C’est là qu’il m’a parlé de la résine de ciste et m’a expliqué que lorsque les chèvres et les moutons pâturent dans la garrigue et passent entre les plants de ciste pendant la saison chaude, ils accumulent alors sur leur pelage des gouttelettes de sève et les tiques leur fichent la paix. J’ai donc creusé le sujet et trouvé quelques informations sur les vertus répulsives du ciste, ainsi que plusieurs allusions à une étude mais je n’ai pas encore réussi à la trouver. D’après ces informations, on peut utiliser le ciste en interne comme en externe. Je pense que c’est une forte probabilité, car le ciste a fait l’objet d’études pour traiter la maladie de Lyme, ainsi que pour son utilisation en prophylaxie En général j’ai pu observer que les plantes qui traitent les maladies des tiques ont tendance à fonctionner aussi comme répulsif. En Corse, certains oiseaux en mettent dans leurs nids comme protection contre les parasites. RECETTES INFUSION : Il faut 2 cuillers à café de ciste pour 250ml d’eau, et laisser infuser a couvert pour conserver les phénols volatiles pendant au moins 10-15mn. Filtrer, faire sécher le ciste qui peut être réutilisé une seconde fois, si on a un produit de qualité. Dosage et fréquence pour chiens et chats (*) : 1 cuiller à soupe d’infusion par tranche de 5kg par jour. Il faut compter 5 à 7 jours avant de constater les premiers effets, et 10 à 12 jours pour atteindre l’efficacité maximum. Aucun effet secondaire connu, mais observer une petite fenêtre thérapeutique est toujours utile, donner 4 jours sur 5 ou 6, après les 3 premières semaines de cure. SOUS FORME DE PLANTE SÉCHÉE : ¼ Cac par tranche de 10kg de poids corporel, par jour Donner 4 jours sur 5 ou 6 après 2 semaines de prise journaliere. Incidemment, je vous conseille d’acheter votre ciste sous forme de feuilles et fleurs entières, certains vendeurs parlant parfois de sommités fleuries. Comme pour tous les types d’infusion, la version poudre ou feuilles cassées est de qualité inférieure, elle a perdu pas mal de son parfum, de ses terpènes et polyphénols. J’ai eu l’occasion d’acheter les 2 versions chez le même vendeur, les sommités coutaient 1.00€ de plus pour 100g et ça les vaut largement. Si la description du vendeur ne le précise pas, posez-lui la question. Évitez les produits destinés à la consommation animale, ils sont peut-être moins chers mais c’est le fond du tonneau, les résidus, et ils n’auront pas la même efficacité. Ci-dessous les deux produits proposés par mon vendeur, la différence est pour le moins évidente. Et si vous avez un produit de qualité, vous paierez peut-etre un peu plus cher, mais vous pourrez faire 2 ou 3 infusions avec chaque dose, alors qu'avec un produit de mauvaise qualité, vous ne pourrez en faire qu'une et elle contiendra peu de polyphénols. (*) Ca marche aussi sur les chats si vous arrivez a leur faire prendre EN SPRAY SUR LE PELAGE : Suivre la même procédure que pour l’infusion mais doubler la quantité de ciste, et appliquer sur le pelage. Durée d’efficacité : environ 8 heures. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'hydrolat de ciste, mais c'est beaucoup plus couteux et nous ne savons pas si le contenu en polyphénols est le meme. MACERAT HUILEUX DE LABDANUM : Comme mentionné plus haut, le labdanum (ou ladanum) est le nom donné a la résine de ciste. Ses vertus sont beaucoup plus concentrées que la plante en elle-même, et le prix aussi. Tout dépend des utilisations que l’on veut en faire et de la quantité d’animaux à traiter. 10g de labdanum 30 a 100g d’huile végétale (olive, jujube ou noix de coco fractionnée) Porter de l'eau à ébullition dans une casserole puis mettre le Labdanum et l'huile dans un bocal, et mettre le bocal dans la casserole d'eau chaude. Baisser le feu de façon a ce que l'eau frémisse a peine. Laisser infuser et remuer régulierement jusqu'à ce que le Labdanum soit complètement dissout, ou lorsque vous pensez qu'il ne se décomposera plus ; cela prendra plus ou moins longtemps selon que votre labdanum est réduit en poudre ou est en morceaux. Retirer le bocal de la casserole. On peut laisser le macérat huileux tel quel reposer pendant 4 à 6 semaines pour en extraire le plus de composants possibles avant de le filtrer, ou bien attendre qu’il refroidisse et le filtrer immédiatement et conserver le labdanum non dissout pour une future préparation. Cette huile magnifiquement aromatique peut être utilisée avec d'autres huiles nourrissantes pour le pelage ou la peau ou avec un peu de lanoline ou de cire d'abeille . Selon l'huile que vous avez utilisée, ce produit se conservera de 2 ans (huile d'olive) à indéfiniment (jujube, huile de noix de coco fractionnée). Vous pouvez utiliser cette huile parfumée comme base pour des préparations comme notre baume à la propolis, l’utiliser telle quelle sur toutes sortes de lésions comme des blessures – même sérieuses puisque la ciste aide a ralentir les saignements, des infections à levures, des otites, etc. Enfin, quelques gouttes sur vos mains, en friction sur le pelage comme répulsifs anti-tiques, puces et moustiques. TEINTURE MÈRE DE LABDANUM 2g de labdanum 35ml d’alcool a au moins 45 ou 50°, style alcool de fruits (grappa, eau de vie de poire ou de pomme) ou vodka (*). Comme pour faire une teinture de propolis qui est d'une consistance semblable, on peut congeler le morceau de labdanum quelques heures pour le durcir ; il sera plus facile a casser en petits morceaux, ou mieux encore, le réduire en poudre dans un moulin à épices ou à café. Mélanger le tout dans un bocal en verre, visser le couvercle et secouer. Conserver dans un endroit sombre et secouer deux à trois fois par jour pendant deux semaines. Au bout de ce temps filtrer et conserver dans un flacon ambré à l’abri de la lumière. Si tout le labdanum n’est pas dissout, conservez-le pour une prochaine préparation. Et l’huile essentielle de ciste ladanifère? Je vous la déconseille. C’est très concentré en terpènes, et comme pour d’autres huiles essentielles, l’imposer à votre animal de compagnie peut avoir des effets indésirables insoupçonnés. Chez moi les huiles essentielles sont le dernier recours. (*) si vous vous utiliser un alcool de moins de 45 ou 50°, laissez macerer plus longtemps). TEINTURE MÈRE D'ABSOLUE DE LABDANUM Le labdanum étant quasiment impossible a trouver dans les pays francophone européens, vous pouvez tenter l'expérience avec de l'absolue de labdanum, plus facile a trouver. L'absolue est extraite a partir d'alcool qui est ensuite évaporée pour obtenir une sorte de pate, mais elle n'est soluble qu'avec de l'alcool, vous pouvez donc vous en servir pour faire une teinture mere en suivant la recette ci-dessus, et diluer a 90% avant d'appliquer sur le pelage. REPULSIF POUR MOUSTIQUES Vous pouvez aussi bruler un petit morceau de labdanum dans votre maison ou sur votre balcon/terrace, pour éloigner les moustiques. Il vous faudra cependant du brûle-encens, mais a que pour l'extérieur, car c'est du charbon et le respirer n'est sain ni pour vous, ni pour vos animaux de compagnie. N'UTILISEZ SURTOUT PAS D'HUILE ESSENTELLE DE CISTE, C'EST TROP FORT ET ON NE CONNAIT PAS LES EFFETS SUR LES ANIMAUX! DEUXIÈME VOLET : LE GATILLIER L’une de mes autres découvertes l’été dernier est le gattilier, aussi appelé arbre au poivre ou poivre de moine. Il pousse à foison près de chez nous, et je voulais cueillir des graines pour faire une teinture mère. En recherchant ses propriétés médicinales, je suis tombée sur deux études et j’ai décidé de le mettre a l’essai. Le gattilier est connu pour ses propriétés de régulateur hormonal. La Grèce comptant de nombreux monastères, ils en sont grands consommateurs, car le gattilier calmerait, parait-il, les ardeurs sexuelles, d’où ses surnoms de « poivre des moines » et « d’agneau chaste ». De la famille des verbénacées, toutes les parties aériennes peuvent être utilisées mais ce sont les graines qui contiennent la plus grande concentration d’antioxydants. De nos jours il est utilisé comme Régulateur du cycle hormonal, favorise la fertilité et aiderait à prévenir les fausses couches et traiter l’infertilité (15) Galactagogue Stimulant des récepteurs de la dopamine dans le cerveau, il est parfois utilisé pour traiter les maladies neurodégénératives et la dépression Pour traiter l'hyperplasie bénigne de la prostate Améliorer la consolidation des fractures (10) Anti inflammatoire et analgésique (11) Modulateur endocrinien, et notamment utilisé pour traiter la maladie de Cushing chez le chien et le cheval (12) Anti-oxydant et anticancéreux (carcinome pulmonaire, carcinome mammaire (13), cancer de la prostate) (14) Traite les flatulences Réduit l'appétit Répulsif contre les tiques, les puces, les moustiques et les mouches piqueuses (16) Tue les larves de poux et des puces et entrave la reproduction des adultes (17-18) Tout comme pour la ciste, cet article n’a pour but que de discuter les vertus antiparasitaires du gattilier, car son usage en interne doit faire l’objet de quelques précautions, il y a quelques interactions médicamenteuses et des effets secondaires potentiels, il vaut donc mieux l’utiliser sous contrôle de votre vétérinaire naturopathe. En revanche son utilisation par voie externe est sans problème, car même si votre animal de compagnie se léchait, il ne pourrait en ingérer suffisamment pour avoir un quelconque effet, mis à part une allergie bien entendu, comme avec tout. Le gattilier est un répulsif efficace contre les puces, les tiques, les mouches piquantes et les moustiques et a fait l’objet d’au moins 2 études sur ce sujet. Il est aussi larvicide et agit sur plusieurs espèces de larves hématophages, et peut aussi inhiber le développement des adultes, vraisemblablement à cause de son action sur le système endocrinien. [1] Selon la concentration, la qualité du produit et la voracité des petites bêtes, l’efficacité est de 3 à 8 heures. Je vous suggère donc de l’utiliser avant les balades dans des zones infestées de tiques ou de moustiques, ou le soir en été si vous vivez dans le pourtour méditerranéen, pour éloigner les moustiques et les phlébotomes porteurs de maladies comme les vers de cœur et la leishmaniose. On peut le réappliquer aussi souvent qu’on veut, il n’y a aucune toxicité, par contre l’odeur est assez désagréable. J’ai donc élaboré la recette qui suit. REPULSIF ANTIPUCES, TIQUES ET MOUSTIQUES AU GATTILIER 1/4 de teinture mère 3/4 d’eau ou de vinaigre de cidre, ou moitié moitié Le répulsif à l’eau devrait etre utilisé immédiatement, celui au vinaigre de cidre dure plusieurs semaines. Vous pouvez aussi réaliser votre propre teinture mère en mettant 100g de parties aériennes séchées (graines, feuilles, tiges) dans un bocal en verre, et 1/2 litre de vodka ou d'alcool a 45 ou 50 degrés. Réduisez-les en poudre pour en extraire le plus de composants possible. Laisser macérer pendant deux à trois semaines et agiter au moins une fois par jour. Au bout de ce temps, filtrer les solides à l'aide d'une étamine ou d'un filtre à café. Certains chiens n’aimant pas les sprays, vous pouvez en mettre sur vos mains et frictionner le pelage de votre chien ou chat avec, ou encore remplacer l’eau/vinaigre par une huile végétale et en faire un baume. Je n’ai pas eu l’opportunité de l’essayer sur les puces puisque mes chiens n’en n’avaient pas, mais je confirme l’efficacité sur les tiques. En octobre, j’ai emmené Yulia, qui est un véritable aimant à tiques, pour une ballade en forêt. Alors que d’ordinaire sans protection, on lui en trouvait plusieurs accrochées et une douzaine qui cherchaient un endroit pour monter leur tente, je n’en ai trouvé qu’une seule sur la patte et qui semblait chercher la sortie. A l’approche du printemps, j’essaierai d’autres recettes avec le gattilier, et je ne manquerai pas de les ajouter a cet article. PANNEAU CENTRAL : LE QUASSIA AMARA Le quassia amara, ou amargo, est un petit arbre ou buisson tropical et subtropical de la famille des Simaroubaceae, pouvant atteindre jusqu’à 5 mètres. Son bois est utilisé pour ses vertus médicinales et les extraits d'écorce comme arôme dans l’industrie alimentaire. Il existe plusieurs types de quassia, celui-ci étant le plus connu, mais ils ont tous relativement les mêmes vertus. Parmi ses utilisations, on trouve notamment : Au niveau de l’appareil digestif, il est connu pour restaurer l'appétit, traiter l’anorexie, stimuler la digestion, traiter la diarrhée comme la constipation et la dysenterie. Sur le plan hépatique on l’utilise pour la cirrhose du foie et l’alcoolisme Fébrifuge, il traite diverses conditions telles que la rougeole, la variole et le paludisme. L’un de ses composants : la quassine, fait l’objets d’études pour traiter la leishmaniose Il est aussi utile en cas de, maladie des voies urinaires, de diabète, d’albuminurie Il est tonique et purgatif Anti-leucémique Grâce à ses propriétés analgésiques, en application externe il peut traiter les douleurs articulaires et les ulcères veineux. C’est aussi un vermifuge, mais il y a très peu d’informations disponibles sur ce sujet, surtout concernant nos animaux de compagnie. Il a un seuil de toxicité extrêmement bas puisqu’il est utilisé comme additif alimentaire, mais il est difficile de faire la part des choses, surtout en ce moment, c’est pour cela que nous ne parlerons ici que de son utilisation comme antiparasitaire. Le quassia contient un composant du nom de quassine, est insecticide, larvicide et nématicide. Il attaque la chitine des larves de nombreux acariens et insectes, les empêchant ainsi de passer au stade de larve. Son goût amer repousse les puces, les acariens, les moustiques et autres insectes hématophages, et je comprends pourquoi. J’ai voulu gouter pour voir, c’est absolument horrible. Il y a peu de chance que votre compagnon quatre pattes le lèche plus d’une fois. Il existe des produits prêts à l’emploi, pas encore disponibles en France, qui ont des retours mitigés et auxquels les fabricants ont malheureusement ajouté des huiles essentielles, de sorte qu’on ne sait pas lequel de ces ingrédients fonctionne vraiment. De plus certains chiens – dont les miens - ne réagissent pas bien aux huiles essentielles, j’ai donc concocté mes propres recettes, testées et approuvées ! SPRAY REPULSIF 20 grammes d’écorce de quassia amara (si les morceaux d’écorce ou de bois sont gros, réduisez-les d’abord en poudre) 200ml d’eau 50ml de vinaigre de cidre Faire bouillir le quassia dans l’eau pendant 10 à 15mn, puis laisser macérer pendant quelques heures. Filtrer et presser l’écorce pour en extraire le plus de liquide possible. Il est aussi possible de le laisser macérer sans le chauffer, mais au moins une nuit. Dans les 2 cas, ne jetez pas le quassia, faites-le sécher car il peut être utilisé encore une ou deux fois. Laisser refroidir, puis ajouter le vinaigre. Vaporiser ou masser légèrement dans le pelage du chien pour repousser puces, tiques et acariens, y compris les aoutats. Si votre chien est infesté de puces, il est préférable de lui faire d’abord un shampoing, rincer, puis utiliser le spray ou mettre le quassia dans l’eau de rinçage. Ce mélange se conserve environ un mois. L’été dernier, pour la première fois en 10 ans de prévention naturelle, mes chiens ont eu une infestation de puces. Ce qui est curieux c’est que les crottes et les larves de puces étaient concentrées a un endroit bien précis sur chacun d’eux. Malibu et Yulia en avaient le bas du cou et le poitrail bardé, et sur Khéops c’était à la base de la queue. Lors de la première application j’en ai mis principalement sur ces zones, puis j’ai remis du produit sur mes mains et je les ai passé vite fait sur le reste de leur pelage. En moins de 48 heures il n’y en avait plus du tout. Les effets sur les puces ont duré environ deux semaines sur Khéops et Yulia et une dizaine de jours sur Malibu, lors de cette 1ere utilisation. Pour la seconde application j’ai utilisé le gel. En quelques heures les puces étaient parties et ne sont plus jamais revenues. D’après ce que j’ai pu trouver et observer, la durée d’efficacité dépend surtout de la qualité de votre produit, mais mes recherches indiquent un mois. Vous pouvez faire la macération dans du vinaigre de cidre au lieu de l’eau, cela se conservera plusieurs mois, et vous pouvez le diluer de moitié ou ¾ au moment de l’utiliser. GEL REPULSIF Réaliser une teinture mère en suivant les mêmes proportions que pour le spray au gattilier, puis mélanger en utilisant les mêmes proportions, soit : ¼ de teinture mère ¾ de gel d’aloé vera. Frictionner une petite quantité dans le pelage du chien. SPOT ON Mélanger quelques gouttes d’huile de neem avec la même quantité de teinture mère de quassia. Déposer quelques gouttes de ce mélange, sur le cou du chien, entre les omoplates et à la base de la queue. Vous pouvez le préparer à l’avance, il se conserve plusieurs semaines dans un flacon ambré et à l’abri de la lumière. Aucune idée de la durée d’efficacité, mes chiens n’ayant plus eu de puces, je n’ai pu tester cette recette.
